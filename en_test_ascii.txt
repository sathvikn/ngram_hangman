Commandment number nine
Thou shalt love what is possible
Honey we have gone over this
you did not know the guy was getting married
it is all right
he was not possible
not that one
the next one
Commandment ten
Thou shalt not fear
yes
Thou shalt not fear
what are you talking about fear
what you did was an incredibly brave thing
you dropped all of your boundaries and you met this guy halfway
more than halfway you went to Somerset
Guys it was just another game
Come on
lf he hadn't been getting married if he was not the groom what would i have done
that is right
i would've done the same old thing
i would have hesitated
i would have froze up
i would have kissed him and then ran off
Give him the wrong phone number
Hook that fish and just throw him right back
Jesus
i am stuck in a rut
Big fat rut
Guys i do not want to be that girl anymore
i know

None of us do

for not telling you i was getting married
i should have told you that and i did not
i am sorry
you are the guy that needs the last fling before your wedding

that was all there was to it
we had fun we talked and that was it
Right
yeah i guess you are right
i did not get married
what do you mean
Judy and i we called it off
i hope my
that thing that happened did not have anything to do with it
no it had nothing to do with that
we realized we were doing the wrong thing
two people should be in love
but Judy is happy
she is scuba diving in Bali
she really liked you too
Why were you at my wedding
it was just one of those spontaneous things my girlfriend and i do
it was just really
it just got screwed up
i came here tonight because i wanted to see you
i thought that maybe
Well that night that we met l thought there was something some feeling i had about us
i thought that maybe you might feel that way too
ls this a mutual thing
this is not a mutual thing at all
this is a very stupid thing
i am stupid

i really apologize for wasting your time
and i will go jump off the Golden Gate Bridge now

i need my other spear
i will chase it to you
Try and fucking hit it
Get it
Get it
how is that for hitting what i aim at
you little shit ass
Jesus
Holy shit
it was an accident
the sun got in my eyes
besides he was an asshole
what do we tell the tribe
it was an accident
Let's leave the body
we will see what my father says
i feel a storm coming
Shit
Let's go
i hate outside
Come on
Let's go
the outside is beautiful
my brother was like you
they found his bones picked clean
Did you catch something ls it meat
i haven't had meat in months
David i heard someone was killed
i thought
it was Nathaniel
he fell off a cliff
i need to see my father
so he is dead and we still do not have any food to give to the tribe
Send children to do a man's job
where is the body
we hid it
you told them he fell off a cliff
yes
okay fuck it
the Lord works in mysterious ways
God blesses us with this meat
as we enjoy it let us remember our brother Nathaniel who died to bring it to us
Bow your fucking heads
and let his death also remind us that God rules this world not us
the storm he sent to destroy the ancients still casts its shadow on us
Striking without warning killing without mercy
do you know God speaks to me
he does
he speaks to me
he says as long as we know our place and do not increase our numbers to beyond that which the caves can hold we will survive
we will
he tells me other things too
he tells me about the sin in your hearts
he tells me about your fucking desires to fornicate
though it will bring more children than he allows
he tells me of young people wanting to give in to their filthy sexual curiosity
Look outside
Look at what that curiosity did to the ancients
Remember the Lord's words
Let me hear you
God is coming and he is pissed
Louder
God is coming and he is pissed
Again
God is coming and he is pissed
that is right
he is coming
and do not ever forget it
as you know i have had to serve God on my own since he took my wife
but in his infinite wisdom he has chosen a handmaiden to assist me
now our leader has led us well would not you agree
Right
he has
God has chosen to recognize and reward your service
he is chosen your daughter Sarah
i will tutor Sarah in the service of our Lord
she will be as a daughter to me
Enjoy your meat
and may the mercy of God be with you all
it is a good day
i just found out a few minutes ago
is this what you want
it is a great honour
See him grow worried when he blows a clinker
Give me that
you learned to read to fill your head with this shit
this is the old world
God destroyed them for their sins
is that what you want
you want to die like that
we need books that will teach us to survive
Useful books
Books on weather biology Useful
yes
Like these
you love to talk about sin
is this research
Like when you fucked Elizabeth
oh no God selected her
the same way that he selected Sarah
God is another name for your dick
Shut up and listen
no you listen
Lay a hand on Sarah
do not give me orders boy
no it is a warning
you touch her and i will tell everyone
about Joshua too
Look this is not about him
i see how you look at Sarah
do not worry i will share her with you
when i saw you'd taught yourself how to read i had high hopes for you
i really did
so i showed you my secrets
and you shared my knowledge with your sinner friends
i know that you have been teaching them to read
i know everything
i am loved
the people obey me without question
i have everything i need without risking my neck on the hunt
i am more powerful than the leader
you can have this
Shove it up your ass
Go ahead
Go ahead
you ready
Go ahead
i did not think so
Vincent was it really an accident with Nathaniel
he was an asshole
i am not gonna miss him
but i did not do it on purpose
he was a bad leader
if i had led the hunt Heather women can not lead
they are weak and delicate
i will show you
you want to mess
Let's go
Bring it on motherfucker
Come on
Get off
do not make me hurt you
I'd like to see you try
where is David
lf we get caught the rules
Fuck the rules
Rules were made up by the elders to keep us scared and stupid
they do not want us to know how the old world was
but i know
i have read the books
People lived in huge cities that stretched up to the sky
they had heat and cool air when they wanted
so they never went outside
they did
Always
they weren't nature's slaves but its masters
they could do anything imagined
if we keep studying them one day we will re create that world
not if your father is leading
he won't live forever
we are the future of this tribe
Come on let's start your lesson
Dear Penthouse Forum
i never believed those articles you printed were true until my con
conservative wife asked me to ream her bunghole with a'veebrating daldo'
Vibrating dildo
how many times have we been over the l' s
i have never heard these words
i do not know what a bunghole is
but i bet your father does
that is why you are mad
Your dad's gonna fill up your girl with God
Damn right i am angry
i am sick and tired of his lies
Tell them what he did to you Elizabeth
Come on
we are friends
it is okay
Tell us
what is it
he asked me to his room to show me something
it was his spear
i will give you a spear
Shut up
he said God wanted it inside me but i did not want it inside me
he said if i did not God would be mad and I'd get worse than a whipping
Bastard
but what can we do about it
Give him a vibrating dildo and shove it up his bunghole
Shit
do you like the cave
it is nice
this is where God appeared to me and said Sarah
he chose you
is not that an honour to be chosen to serve God
you are not like the others
they are dirty
you are clean
God chose you
a great honour to serve God is not it
you will get to serve God
you have been chosen
you have been chosen
my body is the temple
my seed is the sacrament
Prepare to accept the Lord
no please
no please
no
Please no
it is okay
God said this is how it should be
now do not make a sound
no
you little fucker
no
Please do not
do not hurt him
i am gonna kill you
do not hurt him
i will kill you
i will kill you
do not hurt him
oh my God
oh my God
Dad
Time to die pretty boy
Get off me man
Get in there
Kill him before God destroys us all
Kill him
you killed your father
you fucked up pretty boy
we will take care of that princess for you
how is that
Stop following me
what the fuck was he thinking
was he supposed to let him rape her
that spoiled bitch
i would have
she followed me
God damn it Sarah
Turn around and walk out of here
it is your fault he is gonna die
Unless we do something
Come on
what are you doing
they will kill you
Get out of here
this is crazy
Hurry up
Get out of here
Let's get the fuck out of here
Hurry
Hold me up
you should not have done this
Go back
you know what they will do to us
i am never going back
you are the closest thing to a family i have David
we always talked about starting over
we have no choice
we find shelter there is no food
we find food there is no shelter
Think of something else besides how tired you are
that is hard to do when your legs are falling off
i am sick of walking
Did i tell you ln the old cities no one ever went hungry
any food you wanted you did not have to hunt
Just go to a store
Bet they never had to walk this much
i am tired
they never had to walk
they had cars that moved faster than the wind
and things like this never happened
never
no one told you what to do
you could do what you wanted
are we there yet
i am tired
Holy fuck
Wow
it is beautiful
what the fuck's that
it is so big
is this real
it is a city
we are going there
Let's go
i feel a storm coming
my God where are we
are we in hell
it hurts
it is over there
no in there
i do not care where
Make it stop
i kind of like it
who the hell is that
what are you doing
you trying to scare them to death
i am making an entrance darling
oh really
i am Neil
and this ravishing creature is Judith
Welcome to our home
oh my God they are so beautiful
now i understand
all of these things are ancient
but they work
you have power
how
Solar baby
the tree huggers were right
that is the way to go
Check it out
that is great
what is in here
some of these things i recognize
but what are these
what we have here are important relics of the past that we have rescued
Come here Josh
Try this
Check out the chair
it is spinning
Art from a fertile period in human creativity known as the'80s
the baseball Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run
Stay behind the velvet ropes
i know what that is
it is a TV
Watch this
Look at that
there are people in there
no it is just a picture
a moving picture
my God look at it
what is this place
it was a biotech research complex
now it is home
it can be yours
it is our dream
you said we'd find it
you were right it is all real
this is just the beginning
we have a whole world to show you
Let's start with a hot bath
oh shit
Well do you want a bath or not
i want a bath
there is a brave boy
it scared me
i am going in
Scary
what is the matter
you are naked
you are naked too
this water feels good
Won't you join us
there is not enough room
we will squeeze together
we cleaned you up and put those clothes on you
this is your new home
we have already seen everything so there is no need to be shy
it is what we always dreamed of
Come on
yeah
are you all right
i was taught your body is private
my guess is all of your lives others have been telling you what to do
and what not to do
Imagine the whipping we'd get back in the caves
you have no hair
it is like in the magazines
Penthouse
you noticed
oh yeah
it is called shaving
we are glad that we found you
we thought there was no one left alive
there were some a long time ago but they died
Diseases spread like wildfire
how did you survive
we did not get sick
how many people are in your tribe
about 35 40
you know about the ancients
David says in the old times no one could tell you what to do
not exactly
but if you had the balls
they could not stop you from living how you want
where you come from is not like that
no
and no one like you either
i will have to visit
this conversation is scintillating but i am hungry
and i bet you are too
i never played dress up
Want clothes like ours
is this for girls
all right who is first
me
Sure anyone else
Untie this
i have the perfect outfit for you
David what is wrong
it is just everything
Guys check this out
Turn around
Hell they are cool
okay check it out
oh yeah
i really like that
it looks like Bianca Jagger's suit
Neat
who is that
i do not know
for a minute i forgot about what happened at the cave
what i did
you had no choice
i think you should take those off
it is your butt
those are weird looking
i do not want her telling me what to wear
i think that will look nice on you
Look at me
what do you think
Looks good
how do you put this on
Turn around
that is so cute
Look at you
where have you been beautiful
you should not wander around alone
some predators have survived
Cougars wolves whatever
something wrong
you are not like us
Give the boy a gold star
yes
it is getting dark out
the predators come out at night
Let's get you some clothes
Tight ones
Nice ass
we were students
the scientists knew the weather was gonna change forever
they recruited kids for medical experiments
Sleep deprivation ESP studies
this time it was genetic engineering
they were trying to find a way to improve people so they'd be able to survive
how old do you think i am
about 21 22
i was born 1 20 years ago
they changed us
at first i was afraid to die
then i prayed i would
that doesn't sound good
those scientists saved our lives
they made us better
i can hear your heart beating
when you are old i will be like this
so shut the fuck up
Neil calm down
Calm down
Sorry
i
Sorry
you should not pass judgment upon things you do not understand
what we are can be frightening
that is why we did not tell you sooner
Your friends respect you
so could we count on you to let them know in a way that won't scare them
of course
we won't do that
you said there were others that were experimented on
what happened
Well the process the change is rough on the body
we came through okay
i am talking about the grass right
this is the finest stuff available right Judith
i make it myself
the cocaine's evolution begins in my hydroponic garden where the coca plant grows
and then i synthesize it in my lab until it is like nectar
Chill out
you do not want to try to keep up with me
have a drink
Try some of this Sarah
no thanks
i am sorry
i forgot you are royalty
to royalty
Royalty
yeah
Heather's always been like one of the boys huh
but
how was it
Say yeah Say Line you want a fucking line
you say Hey
there is no rules here
i got dopes
that was a quick demonstration to get you started
Think of Judith and i as teachers
there is a lot more for us to teach you than turning on the TV or taking a bath et cetera et cetera
Easy
if you overdo it you will be useless to me
yeah
i am getting stripped
oh no
you see she is not one of the boys
Shut up
what
David why do not you kiss Sarah's neck
Bye bye
no i will go with you
David come on
you think you are too good for us
Judith relax
it is all new to them
they are scared
you are right
you can do anything here
it is okay to be scared
you get to do what you want or not
all right
all right
have a good time
but you know what
Sarah
you are missing something quite special because sex with us is like nothing you have ever fucking imagined
and our
our heightened senses will
Ta ta darling

they say i will be here a while
but they are taking good care of me
are you all right
i feel dizzy
we better get you out of here
Tell everyone i say hello
i will
i am going to the bedroom
how is she
i am not sure
what do you mean
Well she is sick but she doesn't seem that bad
she was smiling
she said to say hi
Told you
Sorry we scared you
i know how you can make it up to us
Maybe this afternoon
but just for you
you idiot
Why'd you let her turn around
she saw me
she did not
she saw what you wanted her to
what did i say motherfucker
she saw me
Even if she did it was for what two seconds
she will think she imagined it
she is already sketchy
we planned this out so carefully
Fuck our plans
i am tired of walking around on eggshells
if she gets too suspicious i will kill her
how do you do that
it is easy for me
i was a better hunter than any of those bungholes
so how was it with David
how was what
i thought you were gonna fuck
we are not in the caves
no one will stop us here
it was great
Ask Elizabeth
we can not get near her
what are you afraid of
i do not want to
Why
you were there you saw
you weren't curious
no
i do not like them
not even Judith
Judith's every fantasy you can imagine
Even the ones you can not
what is wrong
something wrong with it
there is something wrong with you
i see the boys have found their toys
you have worked up a sweat
i hope you haven't tired yourselves out
Like the song Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
i want some delight
they do not understand
that is one good thing about the end of the world
are you coming
Sure
Bye
you know where to find us if you change your mind
do you wanna go
i wanna be with you
oh how cute
not like that
when
we do everything else
i suck your dick
you act like it is gonna fucking kill you
i want meat
i am going hunting
i am a hunter
can i come
yeah
God it is beautiful
all the parts fit together perfectly
Like a woman
Like a beautiful woman
if you want me to leave you alone say the word
you know what i mean
it is just everything's so perfect here
in the caves everything was about surviving
here it is about living
i feel
i have only been here a few days but i feel like i am home
i haven't felt that way since my family died
you have been better to me than anyone
Listen kid
Stop okay
and Judith
God sex with her is like nothing else in the world
when we were stuck in the storms i thought I'd die a virgin
now i am in love with her
she says i have a big cock
and God man i did not know a woman could get so wet
she tells me she wants it harder or faster
her sweat's
oh no no
no
is he dead
Whoa
what happened
i told him about the predators
i told him not to go off on his own
i told all of you
Why do not you listen
huh
Why do not you fucking listen
what animal did that
Shut up
i told you all
Why do not you fucking listen to me motherfuckers
or look what happens to your friend
he wore these goddamn things everywhere
you do not believe that predator story any more than i do
i can not believe it
after my father used to hit me he'd always yell at me
Blame it on me
Why did you make me do that
Why do not you listen to me
he made it my fault
that is what Neil sounded like in there
my father
what i do not understand is why did not they just let us die
Why take us in and be so nice to us
Why not just let us die in the storm
i do not know
we need to figure it out before Neil makes it our fault
the worst thing you could do is give me that predator bullshit
i can smell
the funny thing is the only smell was yours
Baby he was talking about fucking you
i see
i am supposed to sit there and not react
after 90 years i am supposed to just sit there
you fucking bitch
and listen to some caveboy talk about fucking you
are you jealous
ls that what this is
you disgust me
for the past 20 years touching you has turned my stomach
i thought of killing myself
me too
i tried it more than once
there was no reason to go on
you disgust me
i heard that already
you may think you were happy here but all i know is i have seen you turn into a hollow empty shell
and living with you is like sleeping next to a corpse
when those kids came along i haven't seen the real Judith since
the first time i saw her was when you bitched about Sarah
you have been putting on this little act
Fucking look at you like a bad B movie
you know that boy you killed
yeah
i fucking enjoyed it
it is good you enjoyed it because he reminded me of you
before you died inside
before you fucked me and infected me with this virus
you volunteered for those experiments
or have you forgotten that part
you wanna say something
i swear i will kill myself
Well call it then lady
i love you for chrissakes
Leave me alone
Baby baby
Come on
do you understand me
now you leave me alone
do you understand
yeah i understand
it is not that it doesn't hurt David
with my heightened senses it hurts me worse than it would hurt you
then why are you doing it
oh trying to remember
what it was like when pain meant something
where are the others
they wanted to be alone but i was in the mood for a drink
Well yea
Come come
Come play
over here
Time to get drunk
Getting drunk with the boys
oh Cutty
i found it down in the warehouse
it is good
my favourite
is it
you can have some if you want
i know
to Joshua
some fucking women
oh let's not talk about women
i haven't had sex with Judith in 20 years
20 years
20 years
Sarah's kind of been a bitch too
i noticed
what do you see in that girl
Come on man
i do not know
she just doesn't want to have any fun
yeah what is up with that
i do not know
so you are getting drunk
yeah
i do not know what to do
i just wanted to have a drink to kill the pain
been there done that
Plan on doing a hell of a lot more of it
oh look look
i made this myself right
it is guaranteed to kill any pain
but first i used to play this game with my brother
oh okay so you go you make your throat like small and you go
you clamp the top of your throat
Like you are restricting your breath
oh a natural
so now take a big breath in and do it as long as you can
i got big lungs so pace yourself
all right
i can not do it
you won
oh drugs
Drugs
Looking to kill the pain
Look since i am such a nice guy i will share this with you
you are the only one I'd do this for
there you go
Bye pain
you know what
it is okay
Get the fuck out of here
Judith could i talk to you
Let me finish and i will find you
i should not have bothered you
i do not know what i was thinking
Wait
i can finish this later
what is on your mind
i do not wanna talk here Neil could walk in on us
Your heart's beating fast
you okay
i am nervous
the best method to pass the virus is through intercourse but oral sex is just as effective
Elizabeth changed six hours after infection
the process killed her
Studying her body and comparing it to ours will help us understand why Neil and myself survive and why others do not
Sarah
i can not wake Neil
Neil
Fuck
you are scaring the kids
Dinosaurs
what
we are dinosaurs from a world that is dead and gone
Watch this
a priest and a rabbi are outside a church and a boy walks by and the priest says Let's fuck him and the rabbi says Out of what
they will never be like us no matter what
that is enough
Go pass out
Good night
we will finish later
Elizabeth's dead because of sex
they make you see things
they are trying to make us like them
they live forever
Sounds good
if you make it
Elizabeth did not
her ribs burst out her spine snapped
i had sex with one
i am gonna die
no Vincent did too
if you had it you'd already be dead
all i know is that we have to get the fuck out of here
Fuck
here is what we will do
i will wreck the trucks so they can not follow
then we will go
Sarah you and Heather stay here
Vincent if they come out of their room you gotta tell us
he said to stay
how long do we wait
i do not know
i am freaking out
i am scared
you are okay
we are gonna get out of here
you are not infected
Thank you Sarah
Heather you are hurting me
i am sorry
you scared me
Heather's dead just like Elizabeth
Shit
okay we have to get out of here
Let's wait a bit then we will get out of here okay
they are all dead David
we could die too
Baby do not say that
Why not
it is true
Even if i die today at least I'd be with you
There'd only be one thing I'd regret
you sure
i can not die without making love to you
okay look
you were Sarah
no i made you think i was
Think that little virgin can fuck you like me
how could you
Let me get up
Come out
although you have missed the best part
Sarah it is not what it looks like
Welcome to the group
how could you tell them
you are one of them
you have been initiated
how long
Earlier today
i was scared just like you
but you will see
Nathaniel called me a runt
now i am more powerful than him
i can crush stones with my hands
i will live forever
i am God
Humanity's day is done
if you are not like us there is no point
you will find out
or i will die
if you do what a way to go huh
Fuck you
do not fight
it is already in you
Sit down brother
Waiting's hard so we thought we'd help you out
Good news
we made an injection to help you tolerate the change
Fuck you
Bad news
Live or die you are in a world of hurt brother
Enjoy the ride David
you are hurting
you are hurting
Ouch
oh my God
is this what the world looks like to you
it worked
the smell
what is that smell
what smell
there are so many smells
what is it
can i hear your heart beating
i bet you can even hear Sarah's
Amazing is not it
Try this one
that was Mark McGwire's ball
David
David go
Go rescue her David
Save the little princess
you can not imagine
i was deaf dumb and blind before
my God the power
i feel like i could tear this place apart
Heather's dead
she went through the same thing as you except her body twisted inside out
we will take the human species to a new level
Normal people can not survive
for the human race to continue it must evolve
you will all understand
Tell them Neil
we reproduce by passing on the virus
we did not think there was anyone to pass it to until we found your tribe
some we will make like us
Others we will leave so they can repopulate the world
at worst they will live in greater comfort than ever
at best they will be immortal
and if they do not want to
you are fucking stupid
i am talking about starting civilization over again
we can make a world that is paradise because we will always rule it
Sarah just trust me
Everything's gonna be fine
Baby it is gonna be fine
and what happens to me now
i fucked all the girls except you
oh do not hurt us we are monsters
first clamp down on this
Pull the pin and toss it
and gas is gonna come out
i can smell that from here
Flush your buddies out
Give them a chance to surrender
if they put up a fight
Put the gun down
when can i shoot
i do not want anyone hurt
Put it down
they will see reason
what if there is a storm
Mine's loaded
i want my own gun
we can detect storms before they hit
Plenty of time to find shelter
Relax David
we are not out to hurt anyone
when do i get a gun
when i say
now get the fuck off my ass
i ain't finished
Get here
when can i shoot
when i say so
we leave tomorrow
Dismissed
i got that beautiful
Thank you
when can i shoot
Hey get off my ass
Fuck
Fuck what
Boys boys
i know that you feel like i betrayed you but you do not understand
this is incredible
Unless i die
there is no chance of that now
you really believe that
i do not want to
does that matter
i am making you immortal
no
you are forcing your will on me because you think you know better
Your father would be proud
Judith wants to see you
both of you
it is your time
you are gonna be hurting girl
it is time
i am doing this for you
then kill me
Hurry up David
i want my turn
we all want our turn
what is the matter
now that i am like you she doesn't do anything for me
Poor boy
i have spoiled you
you son of a bitch
Go get her
oh now you want me
now what am i gonna do with you
where is she at
i want her

Come here
Let me go
Let me go
Time for what David could not do
Fuck you
Shut up bitch
Fuck you
what is that
you want a kiss

Did you see David
Did your boyfriend run out on you
Men are pigs
Maybe Vincent saw him
Goddamn it where is Vincent
Right here
no
he was attacking Sarah
you gave me no choice
Tell them you little bitch
he is lying
he did not have to kill him
i did it for us baby

Let me kill them so it can be just you and me baby
i will change
i promise
i will make you happy
no
you fuck you fucked me up

you fucked my family
i fucking hate you
you killed my baby
Why did you have to do that

Wake up
Baby i would have changed

Ah shit
Judith

Get out of here Sarah
Get out
it is all right
Whatever's in him is in me too
Give her a monster fuck
not easy to control is it
i was hoping we could have fun with Sarah but you want to stay human
Humans are no longer relevant
i guess Sarah and i will have to party without you
you okay there
Rule number one
we may be bad asses but we still need to breathe
you are a looner
Just a minute
how is it hanging David
Sarah where are you going
i see you

Fuck
Love makes you stupid
Hey freak
Old world dead

it is over
they are dead
all the monsters are dead
you should go back to the tribe
what are you talking about
i want to stay with you
i am not like you

Father Godlewski
Good morning
Ah Irena
what do you hear
in the last two weeks they have filled train cars of Jews in Luxemburg and
Vienna deported them all to the ghetto in Lodz and here every day they bring more
you know we are doing all we can to help Jews survive outside the ghetto
yes i know very well
and today i have a little girl
and no Polish family to hide her
it is not easy for Poles either
Perhaps in your congregation
Irena please of all people you know the risk for a Polish family
Even so is it not possible there are some or even many Poles who want to help but do not know how
yes yes yes
it is possible
Eva
Irena
Come come
Good morning Hannah
oh Irenka
Always such a faithful friend
God bless you
Rabbi Rozenfeld
Dear Irena how are you this fine day
is this work for a Rabbi
we all must live with dignity especially in days of hatred
Miss Irena
Miss Irena
Karolyna
or should i say the famous Miss Nijinska Prima ballerina
do you know what i learned to do
do you want to see
of course you must show me
Brava
how is your mother
Well enough if she behaves
and your Jacob
last week he came back into
the Ghetto to hug his daughter
and to kiss you i am sure
Maybe yes a little
i brought a few things
Let me let me
and this
Irena what do we have here
you made this
can you imagine me putting two stitches together
then your mother
she misses you
so do i
my dearest friends in the whole world
Please thank her
Eva i need to talk with you
over the last few weeks they have deported freight cars of Jews from Austria to the ghetto in Lodz
we heard last night
the Jewish Council says they will send to workcamps
Eva your Jewish Council was appointed by Germans
how many years have we listened to their terrible propaganda
what they say about Jews what they say
they have in mind
it is just talk rumor
who can believe it
These are cultured people
anyway we are almost five hundred thousand in this Ghetto
what could they do
yes yes
i know
it is so confusing
one day somebody says something is true another says it is not
every day i wake up my body is cold
we have to get you all out of here
they would never leave
i could never leave them
i can find Polish families willing to hide you
most people believe it is better to stay all together inside the wall
i want you safe all of you
Irena what is safe
where
Good morning Miss Irena
Good morning Doctor Majkowski have you had a chance to consider my
yes i have selected your friend Maria Debinska to join your department
Thank you doctor
Good morning
Good morning Miss Irena
Maria welcome to our little department thank you
my thanks to you
Good morning Miss Irena
you missed an exciting meeting
Issued today the new ration card
2613 calories a day for Germans 699 calories for Poles 300 calories for residents of the ghetto
so we will have starvation along with a Typhus epidemic
and winter almost here
we will need to bring in food clothing medicine Maria talk to Doctor Majkowski see how much Typhus vaccine you can get
since the Occupation Jadwiga has done a brilliant job of trying to balance an impossible budget
but
but if we continue to spread our services over every district in Warsaw we will not be helping anyone
from now on we must focus our full attention on the ghetto
Excuse me Miss Irena
the Jewish Quarter is not our problem
Why not
the Germans put them there to protect us
Protect us from what
Maria you are a nurse you know very well
what do i know tell me
they have lice spread disease and
you know what i am talking about
Danuta how can half a million cramped people stay in good health
one reason another reason what does it matter
all i know is i am not going to bring Typhus home to my family
Whatever it is you are thinking
i am sorry i can not be part of it
anyone else who does not agree with this direction
i will arrange a department transfer
Stefania you have only been with us two months
i have not yet been inside the walls but i know i must do it
Stefania
we are at war
you are a soldier now
a soldier must be tough or she cannot fight
oh
Hold her
Hold her still good good
Why do you bother
because we want your child to survive
if you want her to live please take her from me get her out of here
i am begging you take her outside the wall
i am sorry
it is not possible
next
Please Mama go back to bed
i am fine
do not worry
what is it
Tell me
Irena
Irenka tell me what
Today i understood something
something about what
i thought i was doing all i could but the truth is i am doing nothing
nothing
is it my imagination or was there a little Jewish child sleeping in your bed last night
one child is not enough
oh Irena you are so like your father
little Anna has always lived outside the Ghetto
inside the wall there are thousands of children who could be rescued
Take them out
is that what you are thinking
Past the Gestapo
German soldiers Jewish police
how is that possible
you are a social worker a good social worker
with the biggest heart i know but to risk everything for something you know nothing about
i remember what father used to say
you see a man drowning you must try to save him even if you can not swim
for you
two loaves please
you are a Jew
no i am not
one of those filthy little smugglers from the ghetto
no i am Polish
Let's see you make the sign of the cross
Let's go
with this red hair you do not think you look Jewish
and get yourself a cap
yes miss
if you want to survive outside the Ghetto you must lie with more conviction
and learn how to cross yourself
Like this
now you
Again
Quickly
Very good
Get out of here
Wait
who is it
Hide
they are coming here
Shh
i am afraid
i want to help children inside the ghetto
it is very dangerous too dangerous
yes probably but what would it take
Well i suppose an organized network of people you trust enough money for each child's room and board
and if you agree more Polish families willing to hide a Jewish child
i will try to find some
what about identity cards
that should not be hard if i destroy some of the parish death certificates issue new baptismal certificates
that is all the proof Germans need for an identity card
the only thing is how to get them out
there is someone you must talk to a young man who smuggles potatoes from the Aryan side he works in Korczak's orphanage
Ask him to introduce you to Stefan Zgrzembski
Zgrzembski
yes that is him
Guten morgen Father
Doctor Korczak how many children live inside the ghetto
Including all the ones who live in the streets
there must be at least eighty thousand half under the age of ten
be brave now
have you ever tried to get any out
Out to where
not so many Poles want to hide a Jewish child
and how many Jews would let their children live with Gentiles
what about orphans these ones
Even if you found a way most of mine could not survive outside the wall
Why not
she only speaks Yiddish
is that not right
they all speak excellent Yiddish
Polish that is another matter
and they are all beautiful but most are not passable as Aryan
Irena
oh Stefan
it is been a long time
Irena is here to see you
you attended my classes together
yes a long time ago
Let me deal with these horrible little savages
i have found something here with Doctor Korczak and the children
i am glad
but you still smuggle potatoes
Irena Sendler always straight to the point
Tell me how
i know a few safe ways to get out the courthouse has two ways out one from the ghetto side and one from the Aryan side
that is in the ghetto from the Aryan side it is by Ogrodowa street
i
i know a man with the key
the other ways
i can show you
the main sewer line goes all the way down to the central junction under Gdanski station
and from there
Anywhere you want
one line goes under Okopowa Street another under goes under Marszalkowska third line goes under New Town and Miodowa Street
the Germans keep the courts so busy they have forgotten this entrance
you remember our summer walks along the Vistula River
every step
shall we
Welcome to Warsaw
Thank you Stefan
we will use this way first
be careful
you know me
that is what i mean
be careful about yourself
Hurry up hurry up
hello
you remember me
what is your name
the boy who sits beside you every day
is he your brother
he died
i am very sorry
can you tell me where you live
all right
Come with me
we have hot soup
Just made for you
are you going to get her changed in here
yes
i think it is a good idea
oh you are so hungry
all right
we need to do something about her hair
can we braid it
Please help if you would
all right
Lets take this skirt off
Good girl
and try a beret
it will keep you warm
Ah much better
Good girl
you look so beautiful
Ready for a little walk in the courthouse
my name is Miriam
Come along sweetie we must
such a little trouble maker
you have no idea
Come along sweetheart
you want to play with this
Thank you
Rabbi
for me
such a dashing fashion for a Rabbi
and for you Miss Nijinska
oh yes i remember this book
Come in
oh yes
Come in come in
Thank you Rabbi
so many people without shelter
Eva
Hannah come here
Take this place
shall we read a little bit
Why do i have to be a Jew
you were born into the Jewish faith
what if i want to be something else
i do not like being hated by everybody
Everybody does not hate you
yes they do
you know it is true
what did we ever do
it is not fair
no it is not
there are ways to get out of the ghetto ways that are still safe
i cannot
yes i know
but i have been thinking about Karolyna
Karolyna
we know Polish families who can be trusted several priests
convents in the countryside
Stop Irena
Let me ask you one thing tell me from your heart
how is it possible for a mother to give up a child
how
now i must ask you something a terrible thing
no no do not please
if it happened that the rumors are true and if for Karolyna you had to choose between life and death
Please i cannot face it i cannot
you can Eva and you must
Irenka
do you know what this author says about life
Mama please i have to go
Please
Take one moment to breathe
Please
what this writer says is in order to have a happy life you must exercise your own free will
Interesting
Bye bye
which is why i would never tell you not to do something or suggest to you that i might possibly be worried
i would never do such a thing
no matter what happens
Thank you Mama
Thank you
what has happened
all the Social Service programs
have been suspended
who has access
from now on only nurses doctors workers in the Health Department
Today i was told i am officially responsible for any further spread of Typhus
you know it is impossible what do they
of course it is impossible
that is their point
if i cannot help myself how can i help you
i will need Health Department work passes four no no maybe five nurse's uniforms
it that all
Perhaps a larger vehicle
we will seek orphans and homeless in the market area and specific families we already know are willing to let us place their children
one of Doctor Majkowski's drivers has volunteered Piotr Lipinski
Miss Irena
hello
hello
Thank you Piotr
you understand the risk
Only small problems but i am not too worried
we will take my disinfectant truck
i beg you keep them together
i am sorry it is not possible
Sister Jolanta please understand whatever happens they will always have each other
one slip one word in Yiddish
they could give each other away
how will i ever find them
how will they find each other
the important thing is to survive
Take her
Please go
Tell me what do you want to be when you grow up
a priest
yes very good that is perfect
you can do it
Papers
Vehicle check
what do you have in the truck
we have a problem
Vehicle check
all right
Let's go for a walk
our Father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
Children
Let's show Miss Irena how we know our bedtime prayers
now i lay me down to sleep
i pray the Lord my soul to keep
and if i die before i wake
i pray the Lord my soul to take
first month
Room and board
is there anything else i should know
she had a brother
this is Adam
hello Adam
does he speak Polish
Perfectly
Irena
Jacob
i am sorry i did not mean to frighten you
is Eva all right Karolyna
yes everything's the same
Eva has met with community leaders
they want to speak about
hiding their children
of course
you had a good instinct to rescue Karolyna it is risky but there is no other way
and what if my wife and i do not survive the war
who will claim our son
i keep a record of every child
and if this record or you are destroyed
what guarantee can you give our children will survive
i can not guarantee anything not even escape from the Ghetto
Babies pass easily but if they can speak they must speak Polish know Catholic hymns and prayers
my children only speak Yiddish
i understand this is very difficult
they will need to memorize their new Christian names their new home address the entire history of their new family harmless gossip about their neighbors all of it
what you are saying is we must teach our children to lie
to survive yes
what about conversion
i make it clear i do not wish this
you may not wish it but on young impressionable minds time and education will surely dim any memories of their past
in this case he will grow up a good Christian
for mothers and fathers to give away a child is an unthinkable act
this is the truth
the other truth is Hitler calls Jews a cancer on the nation and speaks openly about the annihilation of every Jew on the continent
Outside these walls there are Poles prepared to risk their lives to save your children
we Jews we Jews have survived in the hardest times
and now we are faced with another extinction
Perhaps this time we can only be saved by a new generation of Jews
how wise are we to take away the birthright of this new generation
i recommend we consider this proposal
Thank you
i am not in favor of sending our children into such a dubious world
now America is in the war
this news favors our liberation and for this we should wait
our dear friend has presented us with the difficult truths of our time
we should thank her for her courage to speak
Quickly
Jasio go back there is another bag
no
i will not
Go get it
Let me go
no no
Sister Jolanta
Walk with me
Please please
my name is Michal Laski i know who you are and what you do
the man you saw just now
he is Untersturmfuhrer Karl Brandt
he is in charge of Jewish Resettlement
we are told in a few months they will begin to send everyone in the ghetto to work camps in the East
Why do you tell me this
i have a son Jasio 10 years old
his
his mother died last year
he has no one
he has you
he lives with smugglers goes under the wall at night risks his life every day
i want to get him out before he is caught and shot
if from time to time i help you will you help me
Mr Laski i will help your son without conditions
if from time to time you help me you would be helping many children
including your son
there is a passage through a brick wall on Twarda Street
on the other side in the abandoned house
does your Jasio have red hair like you
yes but thanks to God he now wears a cap
you know about this new German unit now in charge of the Ghetto
yes for work camp resettlement
Stefan do not be like this
you know how many thousands of Jews have disappeared from the Lodz Ghetto
Vanished
and to where
some place they call Resettlement
Doctor Korczak told me to prepare for the worst
if there is no other way that is what i must do
where is everyone
what has happened
Books bank accounts invoices reciepts they have taken over all of it
who
Guten tag
Amen
Karolyna can you tell us why this night is different from all other nights
Sweetheart
i know why tonight is different
Tonight is different because once we were slaves and now we are free
Jacob
Papa
i am not here for Sedar
i have some news you must hear
Eva
the underground received information verified by Polish train machinists some lucky Jews who escaped even from a few good Germans
they all say camps are being built
Concentration camps work camps
Auschwitz is like this we know
you remember the thousands of Jews who were deported from Lodz the ones who disappeared
last week 300 train cars of clothing returned for sorting
what else Jacob
we hear rumors they are building another camp
Treblinka
Only 90 kilometers from Warsaw where there are fake station platforms underground bunkers
one thing they have not constructed barracks
no barracks i do not understand
Why no barracks
Mama they do not
in such a camp the only purpose is death
we need to find a way to get you out of the Ghetto
Get out you say
Get out how
Get out to where
Papa
Irena has made an offer for Karolyna
there is a convent in the countryside
this is not possible
she will be converted
never
Chaim
These many months i have said nothing
now i will give my opinion
our dearest Irena has risked her life for us many times
now she has made an offer for Karolyna we must accept
i believe a convent is best
no it must not be done
Chaim Rozenfeld
you have loved me since i was a little girl in pigtails and after these many years you know very well an opinion from me is not a suggestion
next time when you come she will be prepared
Irena the Underground knows what you are doing
they want to help
there is a man you should speak to goes by the name Trojan
24 Zurawia Street
Zurawia 24
for Karolyna i promise i will do everything
we know that Irena
we know
i am Trojan
and i am Victor
who do you represent
Konrad Zegota
Why me
what do you know
you created an efficient network saved many children
so far no one has been betrayed or exposed
we with the Underground have a good deal of money and contacts
it could be a good arrangement
this money where does it come from
Polish government in exile in London
to help Jews
Zegota exists only for that
who is Konrad Zegota
he does not exist
which makes him hard to find especially for Germans who will never stop looking
what is your proposal
we will help you rescue children
if you agree
i agree
we will give you money Aryan papers work records
you will get them while picking up the linen from the laundry at Bracka street near the Three Crosses Square
this will be our contact point
Looks like we are back in business
Let me count
Look
Identification cards
Very good work
These will do
what is going on
they are deporting adults and children
Orphanages

Love tolerance and humility that is itNew Delhi's National Sports stadium
the stadium is filled to the brim
Only 2 minutes left in the World Men's Hockey Championship
lndia is one goal behind Pakistan
Vijay pass it here
lndian Captain Kabir Khan Asia's best center forward pushing his team
Come on
Come on
Suspense in the audience
Tension on the faces of the officials
Like every lndia Pakistan match this match means so much more than the game itself
Only 1 and a half minutes now and lndia will have to fight quickly to save itself
Ball with Pakistani defender Waseem
Scoop
but lndian defender Uttam Singh snatches it lndia is now on attack
and a penalty stroke for lndia
a breath of life they desperately need
but who will take this stroke
Ball
Ball
Saini has the ball but Captain Kabir is taking the stroke himself
Maybe a good decision
lndia's best player is its last hope
Coach is this the same team that defeated Pakistan last year
no comments
do you not think our team is taking it too easy
Please please no comments
Hey look it is Kabir
Kabir
he is here
Kabir
Kabir
Kabir do you have anything to say about such an embarrassing defeat
do you really believe Pakistan's performance was better
Maybe
Why did you take the penalty stroke yourself
i made a mistake
Rumour has it that the Pakistani players are your good friends you were the only lndian to congratulate them after the match
Excuse me
People are saying there is a rumour that you or someone else in the lndian team has deliberately thrown this match
Excuse me
do you think we lost because someone sold out
what
what did you say
Kabir Khan has someone sold out their team
Sold out
you piece of
how dare you
how can you disrespect the media
Disrespect the media
you son of a
Come here
you do not know how to treat journalists
you bloody sold out
Come back here
you just witnessed a frustrated captain of the loosing team attack the media violently
his outburst cannot hide the fact that there is definitely something fishy going on
we have our answers
but it is now up to you to decide whether
Kabir Khan has played dirty with the country or not
Satyavrat Yadav National Stadium New Delhi
News from the world of sports
Pakistan has become the new Hockey World Champions after defeating lndia by one goal
Today the Chairman of the Hockey Association denounced
Kabir Khan declared he did his country wrong
and all this is thanks to you the lndian public
we have two special guests
down with Kabir
what do you think
Did Kabir Khan fix the match
do not know if he fixed the match but we lost because of him
and what would you say
These people should be hung upside down
and you
These kind of people should have moved to Pakistan during the partition
down with Kabir
the public is upset with the team's performance
and Kabir Khan has conveniently disappeared
he was not at the hockey stadium nor the Sports Authority of lndia Campus
where is Kabir Khan
do not look back mother let us go
how can i not Kabir
Your grandfather saved every penny to build this house
Your father's first pay check went into making these windows
i stepped into this home as a young bride
Whatever happens i know all these people will stand by us trust me
my master
TRAlTOR
do not look there son
you can close your eyes if you can not bear to see it
i want to see everything
TRAlTOR
Come son
Let us go
the third colour of your being that was i
Papa papa i want to see what a traitor looks like
Come see
Your tune was the rhythm of my life
Just some food for the road
do you want us to be thrown out of the neighbourhood
my divine master you are my pride
my master my life is yours to take
so what have you decided
Uttamji you are always harping on the same thing
what should we do about the coach
Hey why do not you become their coach
the Women's Hockey World Cup is just three months away
the team cannot just go without any training
no matter how much you train them they will loose
the lndian Women's hockey team has never achieved anything and it never will
it is a government trip
Why do you not go as their coach
the team will be out in a couple of matches
Exit
you and your wife could enjoy a holiday
i do not get it why do you not take women's hockey seriously
and we do no get why you take it so seriously
Uttamji lndian women are born to cook and clean
they cannot run around in short skirts
how can an Association member say such things
it is because we are in the Association and have travelled around the world that we can say such things
Look you have done your part and selected the top 16 lndian players
Punjab Tamil Nadu Jharkand Andhra Railways
you have even been to remote Manipur and Mizoram
but now where will you find a coach
from the moon
ls this also the girls' fault
no it is not the girls' fault
it is the fault of people like you with expectations from them
no sponsors no viewers no TV coverage nor media
now which coach will want to jump into this mess to ruin his career
ls there anyone
no one
there is one man
who
Kabir
who
Kabir Khan
the Kabir Khan who
yes that one
since when has he developed an interest in women's hockey
he even left men's hockey years ago
no one has seen him for six seven years
you can see him now
where
Outside ln the reception
do not attack the opposing team's goal but their minds
you will win the goal automatically
Sir Hmm
you have been called inside
Sir Kabir
how many years has it
Seven years three months ten eleven twelve thirteen 7 years 3 months 14 days
what what were you doing all these years
i was preparing for this meeting
he wants to be the coach of the lndian Women's Hockey Team
you are not a child Mr Kabir Khan
you know in a country like ours a women's team exists just as a formality not a reality
Your reputation is already
and you wish to redeem your name by coaching this team
a team that is not fit to play against European high schools
this is exactly the team i want
i do not understand
i do not think you would
so shall i consider myself hired
ln any case you do not have another coach
i have done all i could but you should think about it
i have
Kabir this not a team
it is a graveyard
Why are you burying in it
this team will never get a better coach than you
but think about yourself
i am thinking about myself
you have changed
you have changed a lot
i have not changed
nothing has
you know we did not lose that match because of you
you did all you could to score a goal against Pakistan
but they scored against me my team my country and my family
Everybody is allowed one mistake
Everybody
Kabir why have you come back
to help this team to win the World Cup
which is impossible
ls what needs to be done
when are your 16 girls coming
they should reach here tomorrow morning from their respective states
States nothing has changed
there were states then there are states now
there you go

Just step in my village once

Coach took Memsahib's side
he is only a coach not God
Come let us rest for a while

Apologize to her

i have always said do not play with Junglees

Teaching them hockey is a long way off
i need to teach them something else first
Good evening

New sleeping arrangements
Old according to the old list
so
Tell them the list tore come on go to your old place
no girl will stay with another girl from her own state
it is the Coach's order
so let him say it
who cares
everyone else has agreed
lf you have any problems speak to the coach
Bake in sun all day switch beds at night
ls this a National camp or a refugee camp
Why doesn't he make every one sleep on the benches

lf you want you can go home for a couple of days
lf i go now i will not come back
it is either this side

when you were getting married
i told them everything
they were thrilled then
i had a job thanks to the sports quota as well as a government flat
so now
they have gotten used to the flat now they want somebody who will take care of it
you think it is crime to play hockey in this country
no no you can play politics cricket

but hockey
it is a little difficult
have you heard of Mohammad bin Tuglaq
ls he cute
he was an emperor five hundred years ago
Crazy guy
Drove everyone mad
Stopped making gold and silver coins for copper ones
Out in five years
that is how this coach is going to go
Thinks he can do anything
lf you have such a sharp brain why do you not use when you play
he will be out in a few days
the Association will kick him out
the system does not work like this
the name suits him Tuglaq
Molly Balbir
Komal
Bindia Aliya
you are benched
so till we do not play by his rules he will not let us play
Tuglaq has lost it
Alright

Ok Ok
i am really sorry
Sorry
Hey ok enough come on accept my apology
Accepting it or should i hit you

Admiring your enemy
Please do not pull my leg didi

Come didi let us play
lf we play we will play in our own positions
Shut up and sit down

anyway so tell me do you accept my apology or should we go to the police
Time is up

what are you saying
it is not only me
everyone says so
so how did they make him the coach
this is lndia
anything is possible
he mentioned taking us to the World Cup
he has already sold his country once
this time he may just sell us as well
you guys will keep scrubbing shoes for the rest of your life
Come see who is downstairs

Abhimanyu Singh

Abhi i am in the lndian hockey team
yeah but that is not a career Preeti
that is just a stupid game

Preeti

but let us face it it is not exactly cricket is it
Look at her enjoying herself
Damn it let us go play
Come on we have been rotting on this same bench for the last 7 days
we are players not Association members who sit around
Come on
Come on

lf he is not forced to make me a forward again my name is not Bindia Naik
or his is not Tuglaq
Sorry sir it will not happen again
we are sorry
Sorry

Go play on the Chandigarh team from tomorrow
no need to play here
and you
what are you so angry about
Raise your game first and then raise your voice
Once more if i hear you shout out you will be out
Hey you
Why are you the center half
because you are the senior most player in the team
Your job is not to push the forward line but to teach them
and one more thing
there can only be one bully in every team
and for this team it is me
you
Call this a pass
you are only good enough to plough fields in your village
Forget about hockey
and why are you standing around
Go get the ball
Right left right
left right left
Relax
Nethra
Krishnaji
Give her water and take her out
Quickly
so
you are lndia's best players
you will go to the World Championship
Hah
to raise lndia's flag
the Association is right
how will this lot ever play hockey
they cannot play as one team
how the hell will they ever win a World Championship
what are you staring at
she is unconscious not dead
Krishnaji
Take her away
Out
i had said it on the first day
this team needs only those who first play for lndia then for their team mates and then if there is any life left for themselves
Let's start again
Right
so
Did you see what happens when you let the coach think he is God
the blood will not stop
i warned you guys
do you want to eat something
Wake up at 4am run for 20 km
and on the field he does not let us play
what kind of a camp is this
does it hurt a lot
here
it hurts here
he insulted us
Hit with the ball
he knows damn well you cannot speak English
but you have to learn it
what you have not learnt in your whole life learn it in a day
else get out of the team
Hey he cannot throw you out
do not worry i will teach you
how can he cut you out of the team
what do you say Aliya
no freedom to eat to move around and when we play he insults us
this is not a primary school
each girl is a National level player
a champion from her state that is why she is here
lf there is any failure amongst us it is him
Sold his team out in the World Cup
was thrown out of the team the country
what else can i say
i am ashamed to say any more
does it hurt
i have a spray
how is Nethra
OK
the doctor says she will be back to practice in a couple of days
Practice
have you lost it
from now on there will be no practice
there will be no practice from tomorrow
Look here
you look here
we know you like him but you should also realise that the team is on this side
it is time you choose which side you are on
yes
Definitely
i have thought about it
now only the Association can decide how this team should run
the way teams have always run in this country
or the way Tuglaq wants it
Let us sign this
now it is either the Coach or our team
Sign this Gul
Sir
Hmmm
have some
was not that too much
they are girls after all
how much can you push them
lf you look for the strength of boys
i am not looking for strength
i am looking for team spirit
you do not need strength to make a team
you need team spirit
but sir at this rate you will become their enemy
lf by making me an enemy they can become a team then it is a small price to pay Krishnaji
Why are you not on the field
what is the matter
the team does not want to practice with you
what rubbish
we want a new coach
i will give you one
Why Krishnaji
Why will you hit us
we are not the ones who sold our country
Quiet
Sir
7 years
after 7 years i came back to hockey with the belief that this time
i will beat the one thing that defeated my team once and for all
but today once again i have lost to it
you do not have a problem with me
you have a problem with the fact that instead of making you play against each other
i am forcing you to play with one another
because i have forced you to think about your team before you think about yourself
Forced you to play for lndia before you play for your own state
Fine
you have won
i have lost
but i am not sorry loosing to you
i am sorry i have lost to my country
which even after taking my blood sweat my love my life does not believe that i played for it once
and i will play for it all my life
i resign as the coach of this team
Please just think it over Sir
you have worked so hard
Today is my last day in this camp
before i leave i am taking the staff out for lunch
you are welcome to join us if you wish
no obligations
hi beautiful
Come on join us babes
Hey come on
she is red hot ya
Hey baby hey
Harassing girls are you
Try it
Hey
Hey how
Balbir
Hit him
do not let him go
not from behind
have guts to attack from the front
you see in hockey there are no cowards
ls this a team or an army of devils
i told you Krishnaji
it is not strength but spirit that makes a team
for the first time i have seen team spirit
Sir
i was just just trying to say that
i mean let sleeping dogs lie
i mean
Hey tell him
Sir what she means what we all
Tomorrow morning 5 am sharp
i want everyone on the field
Chak De lndia Go lndia
Come come come
we will run two more kilometers today
Come on guys
do something do something
my veins are bursting
O please do something
do something do something
for talk and sermons bite the dust
it is time to do something
be stubborn if that is what it takes
do or die all is at stake
Chak De lndia Go lndia
ln the fighting kite in the riot of might
ln the games and the fair in the bumpy trains so bare
ln the sweetness of sugarcane in the clothes of the rich or vain
Seek and you will find heat that bricks bind
a colour has emerged and it is spreading converged
this colour of the reign is embedded in your veins
Stand immovable invincible obstinate in times of trouble
Scraped and scarred move on even if marred
be stubborn if that is what it takes
do or die all is at stake
Chak De lndia Go lndia
how can you go
Why
because we are getting married
what
you can not go on the 25th we are getting married on the 2nd
what
i have fixed the dates after discussing it with your parents
and me
do you not need to discuss this with me
what is the point of discussing it
you want to get married to me do you not
but not like this
i need time
what for
i am playing for the World Cup Abhi
have you gone insane
you want to postpone our wedding for the World Cup
what if it was your World cup
that is a totally different
it is the Cricket World cup
it is really important
this is really important for me
more important than our marriage
i have to go
Good night
Go
Go play the World cup
lf you loose you will become my wife
lf you win you will become my wife
it is not like when you come back the whole country will remember your name
one thing i promise you Mr Abhimanyu
this will definitely happen
the team is shaping up well sir
the captain of this team will be Vidya
Congratulations Vidya
Give it a break
i have nothing to say to you
for the first time something good is happening
Take part in it
you already did
the way Bindia is using her brain
do you think it is right for her to be on the team
i do not know Krishnaji but it is also not right to keep the most experienced player off the team
i do not think we can deal with her
we cannot win without her either
ls this not your World Cup silver medal
what are you doing with it
Trying to scrub it into gold
lf i ever need to sell it in the flea market at least i will get a good price
Mr Kabir it is best if you forget about the World Cup
and tell these girls as well
the ones who you have given such high hopes too
but our deal was to train this team for the World Cup
it was not like we signed on a legal document you cannot hold us up to it
you discussed it in front of me Mr Tripathi
we will discuss it in front of you once more
Look on one hand there is the lndian men's team which at least gets a bronze medal
and on the other there is this team of misfits
but this team is ready for the World Cup
Tomorrow if they are ready for the moon we should send them
huh
this team can not go the World Cup
it is decided
be honest
Tell us you are taking money from the Women's team to give to the Men's team
you guys are athletes
Why do you want to get involved in things that do not concern you
shall we
but Mr Tripathi
Let us have a match
what
yes
Let us have a match
Between my team and your team
you mean Men's team v s Women's team
i mean between my team and your team
lf we loose we loose
but if we win then World Cup
Think about what you are saying Mr Kabir
do not make Pandavas' lndian mythological characters bet
you will be left standing naked
it has already happened to you once
all right
Day after morning
but we need time to train
Day after yes or no
Mr Tripathi
Day after morning
we will meet on the field
Even your team needs to practice
Come out
Shit
we will never win
and by some chance if we do
Chance
huh
lmagine how many goals we will loose by
and once we lose it is over forever
what have you done sir
we are like sitting ducks
Ducks
i have belief in this team
does this team believe in itself
Come on
Let us go
Look you are not playing against these boys
Come on get ready

Well uh Jeremy here is an actor and he recently played Mapplethorpe in a play
Mother
oh for heaven's sakes
oh that is a good segue
Woman
Well that is impressive
but Jeremy of course got to know his work very well and he loved it
but i just find it so unsettling
what do you think Amy
um yeah some of the images are shocking
yeah
Mm hmm
but i think because he gives the shocking images the same attention as as he does his his flowers you know that the shocking images become really kind of beautiful
yeah
i do not know

Even though it is upsetting that i did not even know the point is
he doesn't like acting
i mean i deal with this stuff every day
and here i am not realizing the effect that i am having on my own child
the greatest tragedy of the family is the unlived lives of the parents

Mom i am sorry
but they were completely corralled in darkness
you take no responsibility for anything
what
that is not true
oh yeah
Your father and i have taken you in
we let you sleep late
we let you loll around in that T shirt
and you have just you have just given up the way that you have given up on everything you have ever started
what have i ever given up on
oh
Well let me let me count the ways
Let's see you oh tennis camp when you were 10
i was the only one with boobs
you could get a bra that fit
you did not have to jump ship
oh my God
i could give you a list that would fill a roll of toilet paper
all of those internships and the projects on the living room floor that i had to clean up
and your and your master's degree Daddy said that you would never finish
but he was so happy when you were gonna marry David
he said oh Ruth yes
she is getting married
she will have someone to take care of her
i thought you were finally gonna wake up and see what you had
David left me Mom
okay
Remember
i did not quit my marriage
he left me
and why do you think
what
you think because i did something wrong so he stopped loving me
is that what you think
that i failed
Well that is not what love is Mom
it is not a prize that you get for coming in the clown's face at the circus
what
Listen
if if you behaved in your marriage the way that you behave here of course it fell apart
Hey i have been watching you for three months do nothing to help yourself do nothing at all
i have not been doing nothing for the past three months
how would you even know what i have been doing
you are so much more interested in those Wanguni lips than you have ever been in me
do you think anyone in this house has ever shown any interest in me
oh my God Amy
do you what do you think life is
Just one one ribbon cutting after another
i keep this house together
i keep this marriage together
and i do not get any accolades or praise
i am like the family dog
and all i would like one little thing i would like after all these years is to spend some time with your father
and you just keep finding ways to make everything harder for me
do not forget to turn out the lights

Woman Vocalizing

i am finally melting
in the sun
Springtime is helping me hear the hum

oh the pulse i thought was freezing's coming back

Beneath the surface i can feel they are coming bright
it is coming fast
Out in the clearing here with you

Buds all a bursting green and new

all the planets never seen inside the cloud

into focus now they come they are rolling bright
they are rolling fast
Winter was crushing now the water is rushing in the stream

Winter was crushing now the water is rushing in the stream

the old frontiers of the mind were rolling back
New books new methods were aiding man in his climb toward knowledge and wisdom

in the arts
in every field of endeavor man was lifting himself hand over hand climbing onward ever upward
and on the outskirts of London on a summer night another man was lifting himself hand over hand climbing upward ever onward toward his objective
Catherine
Don Juan
oh why have you kept me waiting
i thought you'd never come
See how my heart is pounding
Beloved no power on earth would have kept me from you
in all this world there is been but one image in my heart
one vision before my eyes
yes yes go on
i have loved you since the beginning of time
but you only met me yesterday
Why that was when time began
Don Juan
my incomparable Don Juan
yes yours and yours only
i wish i could believe you
but you have made love to so many women
Catherine an artist may paint a thousand canvases before achieving one work of art
would you deny a lover the same practice
but how long will you love me
Sweet lady love is not measured in terms of time only in ecstasy
it is a beautiful night
how bright the moon is shining
is there a moon
it will be eclipsed when my husband returns
Love like ours will never be eclipsed
Your husband
you said you were unmarried
i said i was unattached
and since i am not attached to my husband i told you the truth
but let's not speak of husbands
it is such a tedious subject
yes of course
and there is really no need to worry
he is on a hunting trip
he is extremely fond of grouse
Grouse eh
and besides we have only these few moments
a few moments
how few loved one
what is time
a week a day an hour a minute
Time flies
and he always blows his trumpet when he returns
Catherine look got a grouse
got a
who is this
you tell him
Cecil you did not blow your trumpet
Out of my way mistress
Speak up you
Sir i realize that this must appear to be a trifle compromising
Compromising
En garde sir
if you would allow me to explain
i will allow you a decent burial and no more
will you draw your sword sir or shall i run you through
that is not a very attractive offer
however you leave me no choice
now what shall i do
Whatever you think best
but can not you talk to him
Touch
are not you ashamed of yourself
i ashamed
do you think it is fair to leave a beautiful woman like this alone neglected while you indulge your own selfish pleasures
how true
Grouse hunting
when did you last tell her she is beautiful
i do not have to she is my wife
Wrong
you should remind her of her beauty every day of her life
Write her poetry
Send her flowers
and jewelry
be quiet
we should never close our eyes to beauty
if you'd open yours you'd have not only a wife but a wife's love
Sir i give you back your
Your grouse
be careful
Thank you but this has become more or less of a habit
Guards
Guards
Quickly
Guards
Leporello quick
Guards
what now
Husband
Horses
after that man
there
over the wall
Hurry
Hurry
Bring the scoundrel back dead or alive
and now mistress i will deal with you
yes
i
first i must tend to my grouse
Halt
by who is command fellow
by command of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
this road is to be kept clear
for what reason
to escort the Spanish duke his Grace the Duke of Crdoba along this road to London
what next you big lout
how many times must i tell you how much i dislike pomp and ceremony
how many times
yes
he doesn't like them
Your pardon
are you
Merely a simple traveler captain
no matter
we will find another road
Thank you
if you wish Your Grace
i mean
i mean sir
what is that
oh pay no attention to my fool of a servant captain
his brains are addled
Your Grace i do not think it fitting that you should ride into London alone
you must persuade his Grace
Forgive me Your Grace
we were told that the duke would arrive at dawn with a full retinue
oh my retinue is close behind me captain
Indeed it is Your Grace
we will take you to London instantly and to your bride
my bride
i know how impatient you must be
on to London with all haste
Your Grace seems to be quite a celebrity
Quite
so keep bowing
Keep smiling
Imagine being taken to one's bride by a royal escort
they are not only royal they are armed
Keep bowing
Keep smiling
i do not like it
i do not like it
Courage Leporello
Courage
Courage
i have gotta sit and wait and worry whether you are coming out headfirst or just your head's coming out
what are you complaining about
i am on my way to marry a woman
i do not even know what she looks like
Sit up straight
no
no no
i have decided
i won't do it
i refuse to marry a man i have never seen
but Diana it is all arranged
it is been arranged for weeks
the entire court has been invited
Queen Elizabeth herself is coming to your wedding
she can afford to
she is not getting married
this is treasonous
what is come over you
you haven't been the same since France
i wish I'd never returned
you are as stubborn as your mother rest her soul
this alliance may mean peace for England and Spain
yes but not for me
how do you know
you have never even seen the duke
i have a premonition
but
he is coming
he is coming
the duke is almost here
oh do come and have a look
have a look
Diana my child for my sake
for England
Very well
i will do it for England
but if he looks like my premonition there still may be war with Spain
Come my lady do have a look
he is right below
Come along
oh look that must be his Grace there
oh he is a fine looking gentleman is not it
for a foreigner that is
Balcony 18 feet above street level
no trellises or vines to hang onto
Flagpoles won't support your weight
and if you come out suddenly come over roof
Keep horses close
Well my lady what do you think of him
i know that head
but you could not
you have never seen the duke
no
but i have seen that head
Your Grace
Your Grace
yes my Grace
my son
my son
Father
Come
Your bride awaits you
Quick my powder
my brush
but a moment ago you did not want to see his Grace
that was a moment ago
oh you are flushed and excited
Perhaps you should be put to bed
Perhaps
Come in Your Grace
Come in
Thank you sir
my daughter will greet you immediately
you are very kind sir
Diana my dear
oh Your Grace
there is something i should explain sir
but
but
Diana
my daughter
my blessed child

Your Grace
my compliments sir
Indeed we are both fortunate
i thank Your Grace
i thank you
Well if you will excuse me i will
by all means
oh Your Grace
Well Your Grace
Extremely well
now that i see you for the first time i
the first time
Well beauty such as yours is always new
Charming
Spoken like a Don Juan
Don Juan
Darling let's stop pretending
you are here at last
you have found me
so i have
Just as you swore you would that star crossed night when you held me in your arms
i will never forget it
it was
it was
Venice
Venice
yes of course
that unforgettable night
you and i together
Strange music coming to us across the water haunting us
it was Paris you beast
at the home of the Contesse de Trouville in the garden
you swore you'd remember my kiss till the end of time
that was four months ago
Diana darling at last i found you
Liar
Cheat
Imposter
no
for a moment i was blinded by your beauty
Why do you think i have risked my life to come here posing as the duke
Well why
you did not remember me
You'd forgotten all about me hadn't you
Hadn't you
Well call the guards
Call your father
i deserve it
this time you won't forget me
this time i won't let you forget me
is that my heart beating so
no but that is your father at the door
Open the door
my lady
my lady
that man's an imposter
the duke is here with me
yes father i am struggling with him but he is so strong
Diana look
you scoundrel
you shall pay for this with your head
Dear lady forgive me
you will come back
i am not sure i will leave
any suggestions Your Grace
not at the moment
have you any suggestions
no back stairway
no
Imposter
Take your hands off my daughter
Diana this is the duke
this is your future husband
and who are you
Merely a fellow countryman sir
Come to congratulate the bride
Your name
i am Don Juan
Don Juan
Don Juan
now we are ruined
Allow me
you are a disgrace to Spain
and as a loyal Spaniard i shall wipe out this disgrace
oh stop being so
so Spanish
Seize that man
oh let me kill him
no
no
no
no
no
no
no
no
Diana
Diana my dear no no no
Thank heaven i arrived in time to save you
but how i could have forgotten anyone as lovely as Diana that is what worries me
that worries you
Merciful heavens
at this very moment they may be sharpening the axes or rigging their gallows or perhaps both
and you are worried about your memory
oh my dear friend what will be will be
a few women i know i have forgotten
some i
i do not even remember well enough to know whether i have forgotten them or not
but Diana
and after only four months
i must keep a diary
oh i would not start one now
it would look ridiculous just to have one entry
Women thy name is trouble
there must be something in life more important than the pursuit of women
yes there must be
but what
if you would only listen to me
here they are
Don Juan de Maraa you are paroled to the custody of the Spanish ambassador
Come
Leporello my cape
it was with the greatest difficulty i was able to secure your release from an English jail
but do not imagine this affair is concluded
now you seem headed for a Spanish prison
the Duke de Crdoba has returned to Madrid and laid his grievances before the king
it is not only an affront to Spanish dignity it is a serious setback to me and my work
i was able to achieve peace between England and Spain
this marriage was a step in that direction
i thought marriage was a step in the opposite direction
Well fortunately there are those who disagree with you
Queen Elizabeth was interested in this alliance
do you think it helps my cause for her to see it destroyed by a Spaniard
Perhaps if i talk to her
i forbid it
Your reputation hardly qualifies you as a diplomat
yes of course my reputation
has it ever occurred to Your Excellency that if a man any average man makes love to a girl nobody thinks anything of it
on the contrary they all smile indulgently and say what a nice romantic fellow he is
but if i so much as bow to a lady in the street her relatives start reaching for daggers and wanna carve me up
do you now pretend to be innocent
Well for the things i haven't done yes
that still leaves you with a wide margin of guilt
you were forced to leave St Petersburg Amsterdam Venice Paris Rome
Columbus extended the world but for you it grows continually smaller
now return to Madrid to present yourself at court for judgment
not Spain
that is a command
Well at least i will be buried in native soil
Juan your father was my friend
for my sake and for the sake of his memory why do not you give up this wasteful useless life
but Your Excellency i do not consider my life particularly wasteful or useless
i am just seeking happiness the same as any other man
our viewpoints differ that is all
Yours seems to be higher than mine
Possibly because you see life mostly from a balcony
and yet i seem to have heard that when you were young
we won't discuss that
Juan my son you return to our country at a perilous time
there are those in Spain as in England who would drive us to war
Men like that are in every country
but unfortunately those in Spain are shrewd and powerful
Why even the king's minister the Duke de Lorca
Well at court only the queen fights for peace
now you have grace and wit and daring
if you'd use these attributes in our cause
oh Your Excellency i am not fitted for a life of court intrigue
i would not know what to do
besides her Majesty's hardly likely to seek my head
i am returning in disgrace to be punished
as you deserve to be
but you could be useful to us
if one day i should call upon you would you
for you my dear friend
anything
i have written to Queen Margaret urging she deal gently with you
and heaven forgive me stating faith in your reformation
if heaven will help i will try if only to keep faith with you
do so
her Majesty rewards those who serve her
she gave me this ring as a seal of our friendship
she needs friends
be loyal to her and you will find her as i have a generous and just ruler
Thank you sir
Remember your promise
i will
i will set an example for all Spain
Heaven forbid
Adios
Adios
oh do not you think i should make my apologies to Lady Diana
off with you
what is happened here
this is not the Madrid i once knew
no life
no laughter
that will all be changed now that you are back
Thank you
could not we get something to eat
Welcome seores
Welcome to the finest inn in all Madrid
how do you know it is the finest
must be
all the others have been taxed out of existence
may i be of service seores
Indeed you may
Food and wine if you please
this way please
the best in the house
i must apologize seores
These days the best we have is only humble fare
what
this from a man who is always served the best food in all Spain
in all Europe
oh thank you seores
my wife and i we shall do our best to please you
Maria we have guests
you do not know this place
a few lies can sometimes make a man feel happy
Excuse me seor is there anything i can bring you
Seorita you have already brought me what i want
Proof again that in all the world the most beautiful
no thanks
Michaela
i will serve the gentlemen
yes Mother
Forgive me seor we mothers can not be too careful
Don Juan is about to return to Madrid
this fellow bring the black plague with him
Worse than that he brings himself
you know his reputation
i shudder with fear
oh and i with anticipation
Hussy
Get about your work
Soup seores
Father the Duke de Lorca's men
a proclamation
Give heed
by order of the king's minister the Duke de Lorca we call on all men with stout hearts and willing hands to join with us for the glory of Spain in volunteering for service with the Spanish fleet
Adventure and gold for all
any volunteers
you you will volunteer
Take him along
no Father no
no he is my son
you have no right
Quiet old man or we will take you too
you can not
we are free men
Take him out
what is this disturbance
can not you see i am having my meal
you shall have a carving lesson to go with it seor
he is in there
Seor
Seor
oh bless you seor
what happened
oh it was a press gang
and they tried to take my son and me for the fleet
this gentleman saved us
oh it is nothing
Once in St Petersburg we were set up
what are you boasting about
you think it is a pleasure to come home after 10 years and find myself in a brawl
Your favor good people
now perhaps we can finish our meal in peace
what
what is your master's name so i may thank him properly
Don Juan de Maraa
Don Juan
Did you hear
Don Juan
Don Juan
he is come back
Michaela what are you waiting for
Serve Don Juan at once
more wine seor
Please
you have had so many adventures
Seores seoritas
These stories you have been hearing they are mere legends
Old wives' tales
we have only heard about young wives
is it true that you swam the Bosphorus to visit the caliph's daughter
Certainly my dear
We'd sank the whole Turkish fleet on the way
is it true
Why of course it is true
it is all true
but what we crave is news of Spain
yes of our own country
what of the court for instance and the new king and queen
what
i thought we are among friends
Well seor the queen works for the welfare of Spain
and the king
the king does not work at all
Pacheco how much longer must we straddle this contraption
yes how much longer
but Your Majesty i have just begun
you have just begun
but his Majesty has been straddling for years
be quiet Sebastian
if Your Majesty will be patient for just a few moments more
oh very well
oh very well
Your Majesty
yes
the Duke de Lorca seeks private audience with Your Majesty
oh have him come in
Diego help Sebastian
the things we do for posterity
yes the things we do for posterity
Sorry Pacheco affairs of state
i understand Your Majesty
Your Majesty
Gentlemen come in
Come in
Lorca
Rodrigo
Well how do you like our portrait
a perfect likeness sire
the artist has proven himself worthy of the subject
Hear that Pacheco
it is high praise indeed Your Majesty
yes it is
it is
we will continue this another time
Gentlemen we wish to see the duke alone
Run along Sebastian
Sire be sure to lock up the paints and brushes
Why monkey
because his Grace is not in the picture
and he will try to rectify that
he goes too far
one day i shall send him further
Come come gentlemen
he says even worse things about me
now what do you want of us
we have received news that the English queen refuses to sign our treaty of peace
what is that
she demands further guarantees and concessions
but we have already given her our word
Exactly
she has seen fit to doubt the word of the king of Spain
this is a serious matter
what do you suggest
what i have constantly suggested
we prepare ourselves as they do
then strike first and strike suddenly
but is not this rather drastic
Drastic sire
at this moment the English are building ships and arming them
Suppose they attack first and we are defenseless what then
it does present a problem
it is all very well to talk about war but where is the money coming from
i will see to that Your Majesty
with your help of course
there are taxes to be collected and levies to be imposed
this document will help solve the problem
what is it
an order for the recall of our ambassador to England
Recall de Polan
but on what grounds
the New World is our colony sire and consequently all profit from New World merchandise should be ours too
instead it is being paid to the count and held by him
by who is authority
by yours sire
the queen persuaded you to sign a paper to that effect
Someone's always getting me to sign papers
i will not do it anymore
it will be to your advantage to sign this one
but i can not
De Polan is our friend
the queen's friend sire
Well why not write him and ask him for the money
he refuses to turn it over to us
he and the queen are using it to promote trade between England and Spain
Sire with this money we could build a great and invulnerable navy
an armada
yes but the last time we built an armada the confounded English sank it
last time every Englishman from the chimney sweep to Sir Francis Drake knew our armada and were prepared
this time we will build in secret
Even the queen need know nothing of this until de Polan turns the money over
yes but
Sire without ships we are powerless
a second rate nation
but with ships our arms will sweep over England Africa Eurasia over the New World and thence to Cathay and the East Indies
this is the destiny of Spain
Your destiny
to carve out an empire and be proclaimed an emperor greater even than Charlemagne
Charlemagne
yes
yes
in years to come your people will bless you for this
Well here is for the people
her Majesty Queen Margaret
Your Majesty
how now Margaret
Your Majesty granted several audiences
they await us
oh audiences are such a bore
Always people wanting something
they are not important to you but they have been promised
but i will have to go through all that discomfort
and i have had a very difficult morning
oh you haven't commented on my portrait
most regal sire
Truly a king
everyone seems to think so
i will have Pacheco make a copy for you
a smaller one to put in your apartment
i will cherish it
Perhaps it may reveal some of the secrets you keep from me
we have no secrets have we Lorca
our policy is an open book Your Majesty
Written by Your Grace and dedicated to war
Your Majesty mistakes my motives
you have come but recently from your father's court in Austria and cannot therefore understand as we do the problems of Spain
i was under the impression that the desire to make people happy knew no boundaries
there there my dear
you must not worry about such matters
besides the audiences are waiting
if you will proceed we will join you as soon as we can
as you say sire
Odd is not it Lorca that her Majesty always makes me feel as though i was Sebastian's size
now i do not feel that way with you
Seor i am ordered to present myself before their Majesties
Don Juan de Maraa
Escort this gentleman to the antechamber of the throne room and submit this letter to her Majesty
Don Juan de Maraa
this way please
Don Juan de Maraa
Your Majesty
you may rise seor
no man has ever approached this throne with such advance notice
we have received letters concerning you from our ambassadors all over Europe
it is with slight regard and very little favor that your queen receives you on your return to Spain
you come back to us notorious of ill repute disgraced in your own country and abroad
you are no credit to this crown or to our flag
have you nothing to say
there seems to be very little left to say Your Majesty
you are quite right
do you realize that you destroyed our plans for an important marriage of state
that marriage Your Majesty was doomed from the beginning
those two did not even know each other let alone love each other
Business arrangements can be made that way but love
Your views on love are quite well known seor
we are not interested
however the Count de Polan seems to have faith in your promises of reformation
he must have reasons for pleading so poor a cause
Perhaps you can enlighten us
i thought myself the count was inclined to be overoptimistic Your Majesty
Being an old family friend he seems to find qualities in me that may not exist
however I'd sincerely like to justify his faith
Perhaps even gain yours
our faith is gained by deeds not by words
his Majesty the king
Well well
and whom have we here
this is Don Juan de Maraa Your Majesty
Don Juan huh
Bad boy
so this is the great Don Juan
not knowing who you are seor i am unable to return the compliment
oh this is our minister the Duke de Lorca
yes
i have heard much of Your Grace
and i of you
Tell me do you hire men to spread the tales of your romantic conquests
no Your Excellency that is a service that is always been done for me free of charge
you have a ready tongue
it is a pity it is been used in such idle pursuits
a matter of opinion Your Grace
some men prefer the conquest of beauty to the conquest of a throne
you may proceed Margaret
our ambassadors asked us to find service for Don Juan at our court
if it pleases Your Majesty
yes
yes why not
for what work are you qualified
Work Your Majesty
that is a problem that is often troubled me
Let's see
i have a small knowledge of history and a little skill with the sword
Perhaps i may even lead a press gang such as i interrupted yesterday on its royal errand
you will explain your statement
when i arrived in Madrid my first encounter was with a detachment of the Duke de Lorca's men
they were abducting by force Your Majesty's subjects for service in the Royal Navy
Well there must be some mistake
do you know anything about this Lorca
the whole matter is easily explained Your Majesty
this Don Juan returns to Spain in disgrace to hear the crown's sentence for his conduct abroad
what could be easier than to distract with a story of press gangs
yes
yes that must be it
i assure Your Majesty the affair took place as i described it
i will tell you what took place
some affair was reported to me
a brawl with a drunken sergeant for the affection of an innkeeper's daughter
the sergeant is reflecting on a diet of bread and water
Your Majesty should consider the merits of the sentence for the other party involved
and now have i Your Majesty's permission to withdraw
there are more important matters to consider than the settlement of a drunken brawl
i must go too
Pacheco's waiting
he has to fill in my head
Your Majesty much has been said of me
a great deal of it true
Even my enemies know I'd not invent any such lie merely to evade the consequences of my actions
i shall investigate this affair
in the meantime there is a question of suitable service for you
i am yours to command Your Majesty
Very well
you will become fencing instructor at the Royal Academy
and confine your instruction to this alone
you will report to the master at arms Don Serafino Lopez
that is our command
it will be obeyed Your Majesty
and may i add my own humble thanks for your generosity
you may go now seor
Your Grace
Come in Rodrigo
Come in
the Count de Polan crossed the frontier into Spain this morning
he drives on to Madrid
Alone
he has attendants
a handful
Hardly a sufficient escort for such a notable visitor
a larger party has been dispatched under Capitn Alvarez
Splendid
we must see that the Count de Polan receives every courtesy
Capitn Alvarez has his orders Your Grace
Good
Remember every courtesy
yes Your Grace
Capitn Alvarez
on to the fortress
you must forgive my haste in bringing you back my dear count
but it was most urgent
the urgency of your personal ambition
you put it bluntly but with a certain degree of accuracy
Fortunately my ambition coincides with that of Spain for a Spanish empire
to be built out of the suffering of our people and to be ruled by you
the building of an empire entails certain sacrifices
as for me i have no desire to sit upon a throne
i much prefer to stand behind it
with a dagger in your hand
no i dislike violence
i find persuasion far more effective
and now if i can persuade you to answer one question
you may ask it
a purely material consideration
a matter of several millions paid into your hand
if you tell me where you have concealed this money
it will be turned over to Spain at the proper time
for the purpose of this transaction i am Spain
i prefer to deal with her Majesty not with a traitor
my dear friend i am afraid your long stay in a country ruled by a king in petticoats has made you a feminist
when her Majesty hears
it may interest you that the palace guards are loyal to me and not to the queen
i have arranged this so that if her Majesty interferes with my plans again
or rather with the plans of Spain
she will suffer the consequences
now will you answer my question
as you can see we have several interesting devices in this chamber
they have a tendency to break a man's will
if the first one fails we try another until we find exactly the right one to loosen the tongue
i have heard of men whose tongues have withstood it
yes but they now speak with the tongues of angels
you are tired after your long trip
Perhaps a few days' rest will make you more amenable
if not well
Capitn Alvarez the count will remain here as our guest
See to it that he is not disturbed by anyone
and now my dear count may i wish you good night and pleasant dreams
if you change your mind send for me
what is this
Very nice
no
no
that is a gift from her Majesty
it will look better on me than on a corpse
Very nice
Excuse me
that is the second time
that is enough
Give me that
you think i want my throat cut
Sorry
i seem to be a bit nervous
These regular hours we are keeping
Hard work lots of sleep plenty of exercise good nourishing food and no excitement
we are not used to these things
yes but that is the only way of life for me
but you will have to admit that they were exciting days
and nights
Exciting
that is very funny coming from you
Remember those lectures you used to give me
Well i am afraid i am a bit confused
the sudden way in which you reformed one reception at court
the court did not do it
Well i thought maybe the queen
the queen
what is the queen got to do with it
you have been thinking behind my back
because i am trying to lead a good clean sensible life you immediately jump to conclusions
Just let me tell you this
Whatever my behavior has been or it is gonna be the queen has nothing to do with it
Absolutely nothing
do you understand
all right
Splendid
Splendid
Splendid
Splendid
half turn right
Forward march
you may rise gentlemen
a splendid exhibition Don Serafino
Thank you Your Majesty
they show remarkable improvement
we are deeply gratified
Your Majesty's most kind
but may i share the credit with Don Juan
since he had joined us the interest in swordsmanship has increased enormously
we trust he will not add any other subjects to increase the interest
may i inquire if her Majesty is also satisfied
we are indeed
you apparently studied all the foreign techniques of swordsmanship
i have had occasion to use them Your Grace
i have not met such skilled an opponent since i have the honor of fencing with the Duke de Lorca himself
that is indeed a compliment
we consider Lorca the best living fencer in Spain
that is certainly the mark of a good duelist Your Majesty to be living
i wish i knew how to duel
Whom would you choose for your opponent
a mouse
Caterpillar
or perhaps his Grace
I'd considered it an honor to teach you sir
you will
Certainly
Go and get equipped for tomorrow's class
oh thank you
i will go at once
do you really think i can learn
Why not
of course you can
that was very kind of you
you have made a friend
i can use friends Your Majesty
you show such interest in the academy
Perhaps you'd like to inspect it thoroughly
Don Juan would you escort her Majesty
Indeed sire
an honor
you know Lorca we might find a use for this Don Juan
yes sir Your Majesty
my own thoughts were along similar lines
this Your Majesty is our trophy room
here you see some of the personal flags of such conquerors as Cortz Columbus Pizarro
over there are some of the flags taken from Your Majesty's enemies in battle
Oran Tripoli
and that empty space awaits new conquests by Your Majesties
Unless it can be filled with the trophies of peace i would rather it remained empty
i knew you'd say that
oh the Count de Polan he is told me something of your feelings
have you heard from him recently
no i haven't
Nor have i it is strange that he should keep silent so long
yes
he was far from silent at our last meeting
i can well believe that
however i shall write and tell him how you have changed
i know he'd be pleased
as i am
i am very grateful
now perhaps i can forget those words you once spoke to me
you are no credit to this crown or to our flag
Did i say that
that was just a small part
would you care to hear the rest
no
i give you permission to forget all of it
i know this flag
when i was a child in Austria my mother used to tell me the story of Ponce de Len and his quest for the Fountain of Youth
Thank heavens he never found it
would not you like to retain your youth
what
and repeat all my indiscretions
i think you paint yourself far blacker than you are
it is the color that is said to suit me best
i do not believe that
Thank you
i shall try to prove myself worthy of your disbelief
Perhaps you will
Your Majesty
the Count de Polan asked me to be loyal to you
to try to win your friendship
and will you be loyal
with all my heart
then i shall be your friend
i
i must not keep his Majesty waiting
i am summoned to appear before the Duke de Lorca
oh yes
Don Juan de Maraa to see the Duke de Lorca
Don Juan de Maraa
Ask him to come in
Don Juan
Your Grace
you sent for me i believe
yes
yes a matter of some importance i wish to discuss with you
now won't you be seated
i was greatly pleased by the exhibition yesterday
so pleased in fact that i feel you should be rewarded
i have prepared a commission which will give you considerable rank in his Majesty's navy
it also assures you of the king's favor and my own
Somehow i feel that Your Grace is not in the habit of dispensing favors without expecting something in return
you are quite right
yes
you have achieved some popularity since you have been at the academy
and i think we should utilize this in the service of our country
Consequently i have certain ideas that i should like you to carry out
may i hear them
you may indeed
Proceed to enlarge the academy
Increase the number of young men of military age and add those subjects which will qualify them for immediate enlistment in his Majesty's navy
we will discuss the details later
in the meantime here is your commission
incidentally i was very impressed by your general technique yesterday
Very good
Very good yes
it was quite good
Well
it seems to me Your Grace is preparing for war
does the idea frighten you
Frankly it does
i am by nature a peaceful man Your Grace
it is true i have done some fighting in my time but it is usually for something worthwhile like a beautiful woman
to risk your skin for a piece of extra ground that is terrifying
i take it then you do not look with favor upon my proposals
that Your Grace is an understatement
in my opinion your personal ambitions can only lead our country to complete disaster
i was not aware that i asked for your opinion
may i remind you my dear fellow that in a conflict one must choose a side
the middle ground is frequently the most dangerous
i have been in the middle so many times Your Grace it doesn't disturb me
i see you prefer to be witty rather than wise
not at all
i prefer to be on the side of the friends of Spain not her enemies
next time i may cut deeper
next time
next time i will wear my old clothes
Your Excellency
what is happened Your Grace
never mind give me that
what news of the Count de Polan
he still refuses to speak
Very well
we shall wait no longer
Take him to the torture chamber
yes Your Grace
we are pleased to have you with us Count D'Orsini
we hope to see more of you and your bride before your return to Italy
Thank you Your Majesty
and i am sure that the people of my country will welcome this alliance
and now we must not keep you any longer
you are very kind Your Majesty
and i am deeply grateful for this reception
Your Majesty i had a difficult time getting him here
i had to force him
you may leave us Sebastian
yes Your Majesty
would you care to take a walk with me in the garden
with Your Majesty's permission
i believe congratulations are in order Don Juan
a royal commission is a great honor
you should be very proud
i suppose i should Your Majesty
but i rejected the commission
i do not understand
it would have meant so much to you
yes i suppose so
but i have always looked upon the academy as a school for the art of defense
not aggression
oh i agree
i heard of the Duke's plan last evening
Surely not from him
the palace has large keyholes
my informer has small ears
i detest this intrigue but Lorca has his spies so i must have mine
Spies are not enough Your Majesty
i assure you you need constant protection
someone you can trust who will watch over you
do not you think you make too much of my danger
Well when it concerns Your Majesty's welfare perhaps i am overcautious
may i suggest you be equally cautious concerning yourself
if you have made an enemy of the Duke that is unwise
yes i am well aware of that Your Majesty
as a matter of fact it is already cost me my best jacket
Hot tempered is not he
however i will make friends and choose enemies to please myself not the Duke de Lorca
i wish there were more men in Spain with the courage to defy his Grace
i am glad you came back
so am i
Look
These materials have just arrived from Holland
are not they lovely
Beautiful
you have been to Holland haven't you
Briefly
i always wanted to travel
i envy you
Tell me Don Juan do not you miss the life you once led
Well i meant it must have been so interesting
and you have changed so completely
yes it is been quite a surprise to me too Your Majesty
Perhaps it is because i found something i always wanted
oh yes
yes of course
a purpose in life your work
my work's quite congenial but hardly that inspiring
what is it then
Please be seated
Tell me
shall i command you
if you command me then i must obey
i do command you
it is not easy to tell
Like most other men there is always been an imaginary woman in my life
i endowed her with all the virtues
i clothed her in perfection
Naturally i searched for her in vain
i thought she could never exist except in my mind
now i find she does
who is this woman
you choose to keep her a secret
Only because she doesn't know how deeply i care for her
Well you never hesitate to express your love to other women
she is not like other women
Well spoken
what is she like
Beautiful
but strangely unaware of her beauty
Passionate too but without any real knowledge of passion
Unafraid of love because i do not think she is ever known love
but she is taught me virtue and dignity and wisdom
you seem to have chosen a paragon among women
Among women and among queens
have you forgotten to whom you are speaking
no
some men shut their eyes and dream others open their eyes and hope
all my life i have been stumbling around as if in darkness
i am no longer
Silence
you have no right to speak to me that way
i forbid you
i would never have spoken except by your command
then i was wrong to command you
Wrong to think that you could ever reform or to believe that friendship and loyalty could replace your desire for conquest
that is not true
you may go seor
yes Your Majesty
so
Don Juan
Again
Correct
Excellent
now me
Arm extended
what was that
my new side step
Let me see it
do not ever sidestep the wrong way
Continue
no no no
what are you trying to do club the man to death
this my friend is a rapier not an axe
now watch
all right en garde
now beat extend and lunge
Thus you see
is not he charming
Serafino can nothing be done about these gaping ogling visitors
of course in the past nobody came but an occasional old soldier
now
now we have a whole flock of chattering females
Look at them up there looks like a hen roost
yes this feminine interest is surprising
Personally i have had enough feminine interest for the day
if you do not mind
that will be all
Class dismissed
Really
Juan what is the matter with you today
Why nothing
nothing at all
it is just a little ironic
a man gives up everything
a rich full life
first time he tries to be sincere what happens
Exactly what i am trying to find out
Well mind your own business
you too
Excuse me seor
has my brother finished with his lesson
Your brother seorita
yes
do you happen to recall his name
of course Carlos
Carlos
everyone is finished seorita so no doubt Carlos is finished too
oh i did not understand
i call for him every day
yes i know
Well i do not like to have him walk home alone
he is so young and helpless
Well that is very sisterly of you
besides it is quite a distance from here
all the way to the Plaza Madrid
the Plaza Madrid
the last house
oh yes
yes on the right
oh on the right
Elena
are you here again
Carlos run along dear
Bye Don Juan
Good day seor
Seorita your fan
oh yes
you will return it to me won't you
Getting warm
it will get warmer
Listen
every evening that nightingale sings here
how sad and sweet his song is
yes
and my heart sings with him sweetly because you are by my side
and my heart is very sad for soon you must go
and tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow i shall fence very badly because my eyes will be drawn to the platform where you are
no i won't be there tomorrow
oh you won't
no i will never be there again
oh my darling we will be together all the
no i am getting married tomorrow
you must think it capricious of me to be with you the night before my wedding
Capri
no no not at all not at all
you do not
Well perhaps
Perhaps just the least little bit
i did it so i could remember for all the years of my life this evening here in the garden with Don Juan
Well i am delighted to have been of service
i do not want to marry Count D'Orsini
the Queen arranged it
the Queen
yes she did it to strengthen the alliance between Spain and his country
History repeats itself
oh nothing
that is why we must never see each other again
never
never never
i know you will forgive my hasty departure
Prolonged sentimental farewells are too painful
Good night beloved
no no no do not
i want to remember you just as you are
no no it is easier this way farewell
Good evening seor
Evening
Count D'Orsini
Well good evening
you will not get away so easily seor
you are caught
the story of my life
Seor this may possibly sound a little trite but i can explain everything
i happen to be the fencing instructor of the Countess Elena's brother and
would you believe i came here to give him a lesson
at this hour
what time is it
Well you know what they say never too late to learn
he is telling you the truth
if it is the truth then he should be prepared to die for it
Come Seor Fencing Instructor
you will give me a lesson
En garde
my dear count can not we possibly settle this some other way
i am warning you seor draw your blade
would you be satisfied with an apology
my dear count we have no argument
the lady is yours
their Majesties shall hear of this
it is shocking
Unbelievable
Once again he is provoked a serious scandal and disrupted an important alliance
the very same sort of conduct which brought him back to Spain in disgrace
it is disillusioning Your Majesty
this time i will know how to deal with him
he shall be punished and most severely
Forgive me Your Majesty but surely you intend to give him a chance to explain
there is no explanation possible
but perhaps it was not his fault
i mean i was at the academy yesterday afternoon and i saw certain things
what things
what are you talking about
something was disturbing Don Juan
he was irritable and upset and
yes well
Well he certainly was not interested in any of the young ladies present
but the Countess Elena began to
Well go on
Well she began to make advances
you know she is young and charming
Well what happened
Well i do not wish to malign the countess but she practically
Well you know a man has just so much control
i saw it with my own eyes
is this true
are you lying to protect him
Your Majesty
Margaret we have just heard about your friend Don Juan and we are most distressed
i understand sire
our court is not to become a playground for wastrels
Nor will we allow our guests to be humiliated by any of our subjects
we have decided once and for all to be rid of this fellow
he is to leave Spain and never return
yes but sire to be banned forever that is worse than a sentence of death
that too was considered Your Majesty
but to kill Don Juan would make a martyr of him and we would not care to enhance his already legendary reputation
Sire i beg you to reconsider
the matter is closed
we have ordered Don Juan put on the first ship bound for the New World
that is our judgment
Your Majesties
Well well
Your Majesty Don Juan has disappeared
we can find no trace of him anywhere
you blundering idiots
Warn the guards at the city gates
Search every house and street in Madrid until you find him
with Your Majesty's permission of course
yes yes by all means find him
yes Your Majesty
Thank you seor
all arrangements made
yes but to what purpose
we will never get out of Spain alive
the roads are watched frontier guarded
this inn is filled with soldiers hunting for you
Let them look
Seor Lorca's men are everywhere
i pray you will be careful
oh you may as well argue with a stone
the wagon will be ready soon
it will take you to the frontier
Innkeeper
Innkeeper
Watch yourself
Innkeeper
yes capitn
Innkeeper i need money and more wine
Sell you this ring cheap
a bargain
it is not necessary capitn
if you will come with me
Perhaps you will buy this ring seor
no capitn
Only a few ducats
Capitn please
and what about you seor
it is beautiful
Thank you no
Please
Genuine heirloom
See the workmanship eh
Please capitn come with me
and cheap
Michaela more wine for our friend
Juan i beg you to consider
it is madness to try and escape
it is madness to stay
i must leave Spain
Very well we will go
no
not you
I'd not ask you to share with me what lies ahead
i go alone
do you think I'd let you go roaming about the universe without me
i am going with you
and if i order you to stay
then i shall disobey
everything is ready seor
be on guard
there will be trouble awaiting you
i am accustomed to trouble
Fortunately i am a coward
that will balance the situation
Thank you
See the stones the workmanship
would you gentlemen care to buy a ring
not interested
not interested huh
Well you are the loser
it is beautiful ring
Marvelous workmanship
it is magnificent
what is it
what is it
that ring
it belongs to the Count de Polan
but the count's in England
Go in and ask the captain if he'd be kind enough to have a word with me
Excuse me capitn
Well what is it
my friend is interested in your ring
would you mind stepping outside
Very well
Well where is he
Please
Very valuable ring
Very
i wonder captain if you'd be kind enough to tell me how you came by this ring
i do not remember
oh you do not
Perhaps a little wind in your gullet might refresh your memory
Speak up
Took it from a prisoner in the fortress
the Count de Polan was not it
no
the truth or on my soul i will drive this steel right through your neck
Speak up
yeah it was the count
how came he there
by whose order
the Duke de Lorca
this is the final insult
the Count D'Orsini has left Madrid
our relations with a friendly government have been impaired
and Don Juan has disappeared
Completely vanished
is there no sign of him
None
but do not worry frontier guards have been alerted
and this time we will have his head
this time
Your Majesty
Well what is it
Don Juan de Maraa is here
he begs audience with her Majesty
Don Juan
yes sire
he has surrendered
but he says it is most urgent that he speak with her Majesty
Send him in
Your Majesties
Don Juan
you may approach seor
Well what do you want of us
i bare grave tidings Your Majesties
what happened Rodrigo
Don Juan's in the palace
he is found out about the Count de Polan
what
Phillip
but Lorca would not do such thing without our consent
i mean
Your Majesty this i think should be sufficient proof
yes it is true
this is a ring i once gave him
we must go to the fortress at once
but my dear we must not be so hasty
Your Majesties i beg you not to delay
i fear for the count's life
he is right
Phillip please
oh very well
there is no need for all this
Lorca you are the very one we wanted to speak to
Seize that man
if he resists put an end to him
Stop this
Stop this at once
Put up your swords
what is the meaning of this
Take him to the fortress
Just a moment
when do you give orders in our presence
we live in a changing world sire
Even as we stand here the command of the palace shifts from Your Majesty to me
as for you Don Juan your sentence of exile will be changed to a sentence of death
this is treason
you will never succeed in this
the people will rise against you
Shepherds may change but sheep remain sheep
and now Your Majesty i must ask you to retire
i have private business i wish to transact with the king
Escort her Majesty to her apartment
and see that she is well protected against any intrusion
and now sire
what do you intend doing with us
Your Majesty will continue to rule with certain guidance and direction and without the interference of the queen
you will not harm her
not if it can be avoided
i will give her her choice
Either the position of an obedient wife or the fate of a meddling woman
and now if you will excuse me
Your Majesty
all right open
yes capitn
Well well my friend how things change
i trust you are comfortable
what is the matter can not you speak
you were quite talkative last night
so were you with a blade at your throat
i hope you retain your sense of humor when there is a rope around yours
oh incidentally you were curious about the Count de Polan
oh mercy
Your Excellency
Don Jose
it is me
Don Juan Juan
Juan de Maraa
Don Juan
Speak up old man
or do you need more persuasion
do not
no
in which cell is Don Juan
what do you wish of him Padre
we have come to give him the last rites
Juan
Don Juan
Juan
Don Juan
Count Seraf
Leporello
Guard
Guard
the blessing has been given
this way
have you seen the turnkey Padre
i think you will find him in the first cell
no
Mercy
you can hardly expect us to be merciful my dear count while you remain so stubborn
the Duke de Lorca's growing impatient
Speak up old man or do you need more persuasion
Again
no
Don Juan here
Hurry
this way here
you have been summoned here tonight because as students at the Royal Academy i know your loyalty to the king and queen
i also know that you will be the first to suffer unless the Duke de Lorca is defeated
there is only one way he can be beaten
by arousing the people
you know well that his men are everywhere
the streets are filled with them
so we must go about our business with the utmost secrecy
first we must
you can not go in here
how do you get in there
Don Juan
Go
Sebastian
Thank heaven i found you
what brings you
is the queen all right
at the moment
since news of your escape reached the palace Lorca's become desperate
there is no telling what he might do
you must get the queen out of the palace tonight
her life is in danger
there are not enough of us
now perhaps by tomorrow
no tomorrow will be too late
Tonight will be too soon
we could not even get through the gates
do you know a way in
at the far end of the palace grounds there is an opening in the garden wall
and if you are careful you can get in the same way i got out
you will forgive this intrusion Your Majesty but events move rapidly and we are pressed for time
we asked the king to sign a document declaring our country in a state of siege and granting us full power
this is agreeable to his Majesty
but he informs me that you are unwilling to cooperate in our plans for Spain
is that correct
it is
does Your Majesty realize the consequence of such a refusal
we do indeed Your Grace
but rather than deliver our people into your hands we would prefer to die
if Your Majesty would only face reality
we can face reality but not treachery
Nor will we bargain with a traitor
we are well aware of your intentions Your Grace
we shall never accede to such a request
then Your Majesty clears my conscience by signing her own death warrant
will you come with us peacefully
Guards
Come
i am looking for her Majesty
do you know where i can find her
her Majesty is in the chapel
in the chapel
then i better not disturb her
how do we get to the chapel
down this corridor
but it is all the way on the other side of the palace
Guards guards guards guar
Hey
Don Juan quickly
they are taking the queen to the fortress
Leporello Serafino
Fire guards fire guards call the fire guards
Don Juan
Rodrigo
i warned you seor
this time i shall cut deeply
this time i am wearing my old clothes
the sword is not for a traitor
you die by the knife
Your Majesties
Your Majesty
i had to see you
i could stay away no longer
is it true that you are leaving
Tomorrow
but why
Why do you have to leave Madrid now
you have become a hero of the people
have i
then it must be easy to become a hero
but for a man to be leaving the woman he truly loves the woman he can never have that is not easy
but if you stay
if i stay it can only bring unhappiness to both of us
i know that now
you must know it too
where will you go
who knows
into oblivion i suppose where most legends go
no there can be no oblivion for you
where you go life follows
before you came back Madrid was dead
now there is a heartbeat
my heartbeat
Juan take me with you
Strange
Once to have heard those words would have brought me complete happiness
now they bring only pain
you are the queen
without you the king would rule badly
the people would suffer
Your exile would be bitter
Bitter
any more bitter than being married to a man who is estranged to me
more bitter than having you go out of my life forever
Once i promised you to devote myself to the welfare of our country
would you take away the one ruler who could bring her happiness
i asked you that when i was queen
i am no longer
you are
you always will be
i shall be the only one who knew that for just a little while there was no queen
Just ahead lies the road to Lisbon
yes
there is a great new university there Leporello
i have decided to devote myself to some serious study
Perhaps write my memoirs
Well it will be a change anyway
at long last lead the peaceful calm of an academic life
no more romance
no more the idle search for beauty
no more no more
Your pardon seor
is this the road to Barcelona
it is seorita
Thank you so very much
Adios
Adios
Juan
no more romance eh
my dear friend there is a little bit of Don Juan in every man
but since i am Don Juan there must be more of it in meall right

O K
Like this Miss Rebecca
Look
Look at that
Giggling
i do not know about Truman
i will get him to open up but he is got very severe problems and we know who to thank do not we
huh
you know his parents
32
the state requires you to take a written test to drive a car but any moron can become a parent and just destroy a child's life
it is like people have babies on a whim
Surely to be a parent you have to plan ahead
36
Say do i want to become a parent
38
Am i ready
i am pregnant
what
Pregnant
Honk
Watch out
Honk
Watch out
Aah
Watch out
Well i guess you do not want the baby
Sir your car will be ready in a minute
you are lucky the engine's in the back
Samuel
yeah
Right
hi
Ready in a minute
Good
so um we are absolutely certain about this right
Well my period's 10 days late
Right
and there is no way you could have had it and just not noticed
Sorry
Ridiculous
that was stupid
Stupid
could you be a little more positive about this more supportive
i am trying to be positive
Killing us in a head on collision is not positive
it must have been shock
Out of the blue you sayyou're pregnant
it was just a little bit unexpected was probably the reason for the crash
i thought you were using birth control
i was
Your car's ready now sir
Great
oh you do not believe me
no
you think i got pregnant behind your back
no no no no
no no no
do you think i planned this
i am as flipped out as you are
i suppose i just thought that birth control had a little teeny element of control about it
Thought it was supposed to be foolproof
nothing is foolproof
it is only 97 effective
it says so on the box
yeah
Right
97 effective
so 3 completely bloody ineffective
they should put that on the box
here you are
Man
Thanks
we are off
Hey

Very attractive

Breasts like sponge cake

Highly edible
she is crazy about sex

Well she wanted a child
Glass Hits Floor

she said she wanted
she uh
Christine wanted a baby
she was hungry for seed so i closed the iron door denied her my essence
you know i am not ready to be biologically extraneous
she would have devoured me from the head down chewed up my manhood swallowed myyouth and gobbled me up
like some praying mantis
not for me
what do you mean praying mantis
the female mantis after she has sex with her mate she eats him
oh yeah
but Christine was not pregnant or anything like that
no
what do you mean
Like on the sly
on the sly or you know in the run of things
on the s no
i mean Christine has her faults but i do not know who would do that
that is a knife in the back
yeah
you know that is no of course not
that is some voodoo woman who puts pins in her diaphragm
Ha ha
Spooky Sam
that is a she snake
that is like the most hateful cruel sneaky horrible thing you can do
who would do that
no
no
Aah
Aah
they eat the father

i hope they do not spoil your weekend
oh no
we will be fine
the kids seem adorable
oh they are monsters
they are monsters
See this is why i do not want kids
Sean
it is nonsense
no what i am saying is
i think it is such baloney and such a cliche that the artist has to be messed up and have a life of deprivation be an alcoholic or deprived in some way
it is how you use obviously with imagination and passion whatever it is
i love you
Well that is nice
i think you are great
Marry me Captain Renaldo
who is Captain Renaldo
Marry me
Make me your wife
we will honeymoon in Paris
Well i am not sure

i saw you two kissing
Brute

Shannon no hitting
O K you run along
Go play

you weasel
oh God
i am so sorry about that
she is been reading Harlequin Romance novels and she is just obsessed with it
Marty

what a puss
Snickers
Clink Clink Clink
all right everybody
i have got an announcement
Gail and i are going to have a new baby
Under his Breath
oh shit
not another one
so I'd like to make a toast
to my wife the most beautiful pregnant woman in the world
Love you
Hear hear
you could be the toughest guy but when your child looks into your eyes and that child knows you are their dad suddenly it smiles
it is like
i cannot explain it
it is like magic
is it magic when they do that little dribble of vomit down your shoulder
i am sorry if we are boring you pal
Just a joke
O K
Just forget it
the guy is rude
Sorry
what did you say
you are rude
Rude
you think i am rude
yes i do
i am sorry it is all right honey
Let's just deal with this accusation
Like an idiot i was under the impression you were monopolizing the conversation
i am sorry if i am a little excited about my wife and i having another baby
is being excited a reason to exclude eight people from conversation
i did not realize this was a frickin' group therapy session
how much do i owe
you did not realize you were a crashing bore
i will walk over there and kick your bony little ass
i will have my 5 year old daughter do it
Let's drop it
Marty he does have a point but just drop it
Sean he is a dick and you are an even bigger dick for taking his side over family
you and Gail used to be interested in politics music art
now it is nothing but kids kids kids
my kids are very meaningful to me
when my first was born it was my most exciting moment
i felt like i really made a contribution to this world
Absolutely
Congratulations
the world is overpopulated
our society has too many starving children
i would say our society has too many starving artists
it hasn't been lucrative
that is true but that doesn't mean what i do is not respectable
Van Gogh while he was living did not sell one painting
now his stuffgoes for 40 million
how long will you have to be dead before you can pay that phone bill
do you come here to ruin my weekends and embarrass me at my home
Your home
this is not your home
it was our parents' home
you are not making any contributions
you have got no wife no kids
you insult your only family
you keep this up you will die alone
like a dog like a bum
like Van Gogh
Hey Doc you all right
Snapping Fingers
are you O K
yeah
what
you do not look good
you look like you are going to puke
no i am fine thank you Truman
i was just listening to what you were saying
i nteresting
that was a key sentence
would you mind repeating it just so i can get it down
you are an asshole
Right
and Dad's a bastard
yeah
Right
i can not be a father
i can not
i ca i i
Why would i want to have a child
Just so he can call me a bastard in 10 years' time
We'd have to move out
we do not have space for a child
Rebecca and me we are wonderful together
it is just insane to spoil it
Just the two of us that is how it should be
this baby is not a good idea
that is what i will tell her
Beck

Bye bye
i will tell her now
hi
Beck
Listen Beck
Samuel i have been thinking

Right
we have been doing really great together and a baby would change everything
i suppose it could
our apartment's not ready for a baby
no
We'd have to redecorate
yep
I'd have to quit myjob
Nobody wants a pregnant dance teacher
we are not ready for a child
there is not one good reason to keep this baby
but i still want to
Right
Maybe it is crazy but i feel it living inside me

Hey guys what the hell
Good to see you
how you doing
hi
when are you due
oh i am not pregnant
you are not pregnant
yeah right
huh

Good grief

Poor old Beck
she had some bad Chinese
we are here to see the gastrointestinal specialist

i can probably tell you what floor he is on
she volunteers here
i have sold cars to almost every doctor
Beck what is his name

Ridiculous
Excuse me
oh gosh
Thanks
i did not realize I'd left it thank you very much
you have a small pussy
what
i found the little hairs on the bag
what
you know the meow
oh cat
yes we have a cat
Well you must get rid of it
what
Cats spread the disease
oh yeah
where the small worms
yes
Small worms
in the poop
Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis thank you thank you both very much but Skippy is old and clean and won't cause any problem
O K Well it is your choice the cat or the baby
Sorry to bring you that news
Baby
oh congratulations guys
i am so excited
Congratulations you guys
Congratulations
Wow
that is great
oh your first
Thanks
Sorry about
that is all right
i have been lied to before
you are good at it
we could use you at the car lot
Gail
it is so exciting
Marty
we are happy for you
how are you feeling
i am O K
a little tired
Everybody gets tired but the whole thing is just a life changing event
i will give you my number
we can go baby shopping
you have got to get that book
what to Expect when you are Expecting
and we have got videos of all her births
you have got to film your first
that is the best
it is the bloodiest blood everywhere things shooting out people screaming stuff getting torn and sewed together
it is like a good World War i i movie
will you keep the car
yeah
it is fine now
Cost a bit of money
but it only seats two people
it always did
but you are going to have a baby
you could never fit a car seat in there
Listen stop down by the lot
i will make you a good deal
all right
Great
Honey we got to go
Bad Chinese
Buddy
Come on baby
Let's roll
See you guys
O K
i hate him
i loathe him
he tried to sell me a new car
can you believe that
Tacky or what
yeah but he is right
we are going to need something bigger
but you know how much i love my car
i have worked hard for it
what do you suggest
Tie the baby to the hood like a deer
Well no but maybe you could get a car
on my salary
Come on
Well put it this way
i am not getting rid of the car
what about the cat
huh
what you believe Dr Zhivago in there
the monkey doctor
he is right
i have read about it
Cats can be dangerous for a baby
they can suffocate the baby claw the baby
Skippy is 16
he can barely move
he is half blind
he is too weak to suffocate anyone
what about hygiene in the kitchen
you get cat hair and cat saliva
you said that this baby would not change our lives
now i have to sell my car and get rid of my cat
this is the second month and our lives are practically unrecognizable
i really appreciate your asking us along
i am hoping this will get Samuel excited about having a baby
oh yeah
Sure
Yeah'cause um ifthings do not change
i am thinking about leaving him
oh yeah
yeah
Sure you are
i thought about leaving Marty all the time but this is his first time
you have got to give him a chance
he is completely uninvolved
this whole baby thing really scares him
he is probably having trouble facing it if you have a baby that means he is got to grow up
the baby's the fun part
that is fun
you know
Look at all this stuff
Ah yeah
Whoo
he is going to love this
you know you are having a boy right
yeah
Gail took one of those amnio tests i suppose
no
how do you know
i can tell it is a boy by the way she is carrying it all in front
they do not of ten carry them at the back
if it is a boy they carry them low like this
if it is a girl it is up like this
Plus there are special ways to ensure that it will be a boy
what do you mean special ways
Well when we made love
yeah we used special positions
oh please
that is an old wives' tale that stuff
you will see
sometimes i am not sure i want this baby
oh Missy of course you do
it is just such a privilege
there is hundreds of women who spend thousands of dollars every day trying to get pregnant
it is like our prof ound biological right
it is something men can never experience
it has to be at the right time for you but really it is a miracle
and then when the baby comes there is moments of sheer happiness
Even if you are alone
i know it is fashionable PC all that to be a strong independent single mother and uh i am prepared for that
i can do that but um i would love this baby to have a mother and a father
i would love to have a family and i would love to marry Samuel
um all he has to do is ask
oh Missy
Okey dokey
huh huh huh
O K Tell your mommy if she loves you she will buyyou the whole Arnie collection thank you Arnie

Sam my life's a pile of shit
it is a pile of shit
it is empty and pointless
my sister Gail is right
if i continue this way
i am facing a lifetime alone without a family
i do not want to die like Van Gogh
it is terrifying if you want to know the truth man I'd give anything to have Christine back
that is the truth
and sometimes
God strike me dead for admitting this sometimes i think I'd like to be a father
Ha ha ha
Sorry
Right
no you are serious
You'd make a good dad
Well you know whatever but we are getting older

 this is the time baby 
 Time   oh 
 oh ohh   oh yeah 
 this is the time of your life   what you going to do with it hello
is this Major Samantha Carter
who is this
my name is Richard Flemming
you do not know me but i need your help
it is two in the morning
i know what happened to you
i know about Adrian Conrad
who are you
they never shut the project down
and now it is out of control
what project
you have to protect me
they know i
hello
hello
his name is Dr Richard Flemming
he is a biologist formally a professor of advanced genetics at Stanford
he is famous for developing hybrid strains of disease resistant corn and cotton
i read an article on him in the American Journal for Evolutionary Science
the base library has a subscription
Well what the article did not say is that two years ago he accepted a position with a company called Immunitech Research which it turns out is a wholly owned subsidiary of Zetatron Industries
Adrian Conrad
who
you do not know
Adrian Conrad was a man who had himself implanted with a stolen symbiote in order to cure himself of a deadly disease
that was ten months ago
at the time Immunitech was located in Phoenix
one week after we took Adrian Conrad into custody operations were scaled back and they moved to a small town on the coast of Oregon called Steveston
we need to talk to this Dr Flemming
he was reported missing this morning
they found his car totalled but no body
this warrants further investigation
i will have transportation arranged for the three of you
Colonel O'Neill won't join us
the Tok'ra are still looking for a suitable host for his symbiote
you will have to do your best without him
Dismissed
you knew who Adrian Conrad was did not you
i have memorised all mission reports
i just do not want people thinking i am strange
People do not think you are strange
what about Colonel O'Neill
Let's get some lunch
what are you doing
Keeping a visual record
i will catalogue the images when we get back to the base
Teal'c
See
the image appears right there on the back
i am gonna go talk to the sheriff
Keep an eye on Teal'c
Keep an eye on Jonas
Excuse me
hi
hi
can i help you
Major Samantha Carter with the Air Force
i am looking for Sheriff Knox
i am Sheriff Knox
Welcome to Steveston Major
Hey those doughnuts
Want anything
oh no thank you
Sure thing
have a seat Major
so you are looking for information about Dr Richard Flemming
that is right
i understand he is missing
we found his car in a ditch outside of town
it was pretty badly smashed up but there was no sign of him
can i see the car
you think he walked away from this
Look no offence but this is my problem
the Air Force has no jurisdiction here
i know i can not force you to tell me anything but Flemming may have had information pertaining to a matter of national security
i am askingfor your help
we haven't had a murder in this county in eight years
so you do not think it was an accident
Well at the very least someone did not want us to find the body
Did you know him
the people at Immunitech did not mix too much with the locals but according to his co workers he was acting a little strange lately
Strange how
Nervous agitated
we found these in his glove compartment
Amphetamines
he had no history of drug use
I'd like to see his lab if i may
there was a fire last night at Immunitech
the place was gutted
Flemming's lab was destroyed in a fire
so what now
we check out his house
Find anything
nothing of interest
me neither
there is nothing on the hard drive there is no disks no notes
there is not even a credit card bill
this place has been cleaned
Major Carter
can you sign for this
uh sure
Thanks
Thank you
Well this is odd
what is it
this package to Dr Richard Flemming was sent from Dr Richard Flemming
Why'd he send something to himself
Maybe he knew they'd search the house
it is a good way to hide something for a couple of days
Police found amphetamines
we found a syringe
there is a possibility Flemming suffered from some kind of drug induced paranoia
Perhaps his paranoia was well founded
he is missing
his place of work was destroyed and all evidence was removed from his home
Conrad's scientists were studying this symbiote to create a kind of superdrug
Maybe this is what they came up with
Well if that is true then a lot of people would kill to get their hands on it
we won't know anything for sure until we send a sample of this back to base
Tomorrow we will talk to other people at Immunitech
we need to figure out what was going on at that lab
as some of you may already know we have three uninvited guests in town
they are asking questions
the chances are they won't find anything
but if they do then we will have to deal with them
Hey
Mm
Nice lunch
Mm
i am really starting to enjoy this traditional American food
Mm
we have another tradition
it is called hardened arteries
were you able to learn anything
no one at Immunitech wants to talk
our attempts to gather information from locals prove equally fruitless
i would not say that
do not tell me you haven't noticed how strangely people have been acting here
what are you talking about
Well for instance that man there right behind Teal'c
he doesn't realise it but he put eight sugars in his coffee
and that lady over at the counter has been reading the same article for half an hour
since we sat down that waitress has dropped her tray twice the cook has gotten three orders wrong including my burger which i ordered medium rare but is well done
i have been noticing similar behaviour all morning
it is like the town's half asleep
Major Carter sorry to bother you
Sheriff Knox would like to see you
you and your colleagues have been asking questions around town
yeah
is that a problem
we found gasoline residue at the lab
a lot of it
so the fire was deliberate
it means the stakes have gotten higher
if you know something
Sheriff i already told you
my investigation pertains to a matter of
National security
i know
i did not get any useful information today
i am not surprised
everyone at the lab had a confidentiality agreement
Nobody wants to get sued
now we know it was arson maybe the company will be willing to cooperate
i would not be too sure about that
Well they are gonna wanna know who burned their lab down
there is something you do not know
two months ago another Immunitech researcher named Peter Stofer vanished
the case was never solved
Why did not you tell me
the town's been through some rough times Major
Shipyard shut down two years ago put everybody out of work
when Immunitech came they brought a lot of money to the area
so nobody says anything bad about'em
there was no solid evidence of foul play
Stofer just did not show up for work one day and hasn't been seen since
but i did get the feeling the company had something to hide
what do you mean
we subpoenaed documents from them
this is what we got
Did Stofer work with Dr Flemming
they were partners
i am gonna need to borrow these
Well this is interesting
it is a shipping invoice
Flemming and Stofer ordered all the latest material on stem cell research
Really
Hm
there is no record of Immunitech doing research in that area
i know
Why would they keep that a secret
Stem cells can be used to create skin grafts or organs but theoretically they can also be used to create human clones
which is illegal
so if they were cloning and Flemming decided to blow the whistle
he would have to be silenced
but why would he call you
it must have something to do with Adrian Conrad
we should go through the rest of this stuff see if anything turns up
this town certainly does get quiet at night
Evening
what can i get you
Ginger ale
i will have the same
it does not appear we are welcome
Well it is natural for small town people to be suspicious of strangers right
we just have to give it more of an effort
Hey guys
you have much to learn about humans
that is kind of my point
how are we supposed to fit in when we spend all our time on base
Thanks
i have a sufficient grasp of Earth culture
but you will never be one of them
this is not my home
when my time with SG 1 is done i will return to Chulak with my son
i guess that is the difference between us
i do not think i will be able to go back
you are in our seats
there are many empty seats
but these are ours
is there a problem here
no
Apparently we were in their seats
what was that
they are not fit to be in our presence
if you do anything to jeopardise this operation
i will kill you myself
i spoke with Janet this morning
she did a preliminary analysis on the sample i sent
she thinks the liquid in the syringe might be some sort of sulphur based antibiotic
so some kind of miracle drug
we won't know anything for sure until we get more test results back
that is the guy from the bar
hi
hello
Sorry about our misunderstanding last night
Excuse me
at the bar our little confrontation
my friend and i were in your seats
i am afraid you have got me mistaken for someone else
i do not think so
last night i was home in bed
that is a little strange
he did not seem to remember us
Perhaps he'd had too much alcohol
i thought of that but he was not hungover
or did not tell his wife he was in the bar
he did not have a wedding ring
we are being watched
the silver car
he is from the sheriff's office
he was outside when we first got in town
he was in the restaurant yesterday
OK take it easy
Why are you following us
i do not know what you mean
Teal'c
all right all right all right
i was not sure if you could be trusted
with what
i was a security guard at Immunitech
i think Dr Flemming was murdered
Why would you say that
about a week ago he wanted to know if i could get him a gun
Said he was in danger and i was the only one that could help him
Why you
Well that is the weird part
he said the people after him only come out at night while everyone's asleep
since i worked a graveyard shift i guess he figured i was not one of'em
first i thought that he was crazy and then he went missing
that is when i decided that working for Immunitech was a little too dangerous
Why did not you tell the sheriff
Flemming said that no one in the town could be trusted but i figured i owed the guy to tell someone
if it hadn't been for him i would have died in that fire
they only come out at night what exactly is that supposed to mean
Maybe this has something to do with what happened to us at the bar
what did happen to you at the bar
we were met with hostility
you did not say anything weird did you
Why are you looking at me
anyway random aggressiveness in a bar is not unusual
but why did not the man remember me
are you sure it was the same guy
Positive
Jonas Quinn is correct
it was the same man
you said there was evidence Flemming and Stofer were researching cloning
no
there was evidence they were reading up on stem cells
which can be used to create human clones
what if the man doesn't remember because the man in the bar was not him
he was a clone
no you can not create fully grown people
They'd be infants
Still the people of this town are behaving strangely
Even for humans
the town's been through a lot
first the shipyard was shut down then the lab was destroyed
the entire future of the town's in jeopardy
what
you noticed these marks from the road
i did not think much of'em at the time
this area has been well travelled and recently
there are many footprints as well as tyre tracks
Let's check it out
you have got to teach me how to do that
Wormhole theory motorcycle riding and lock picking
not necessarily in that order
in there
Somebody's been busy
These appear to be schematics
yeah but for what
i got a pretty good idea
near as we can tell sir it is some kind of alien ship partially constructed
no sir
we should not do anything drastic until we have more information
yes sir
Understood
Hammond won't call in the troops until we figure out who built this thing and why
all the disks we got from the shipyard are encoded
i can not read any of them
Let me try
yeah
Adrian Conrad illegally acquired a symbiote from Colonel Maybourne
it is possible he also acquired alien technology
i do not know
this is unlike anything the Russians or the NlD ever had
then there must be an alien presence in town
it looks that way but how did they get here
it is not probable they used the Stargate
if they came by ship why build another
Perhaps an accident or a malfunction
they are not finished which means they will be back
my guess is they work under the cover of darkness
they only come out at night
OK
i think i can break this code but it is gonna take a while
Teal'c is there any activity
Negative
how is the decryption progressing
Slowly
Something's happening
here we go
oh my God
Teal'c come in
Major Carter
many of the townspeople have arrived at the shipyard
they are Goa'uld
Repeat the people building the ship are Goa'uld
how is that possible
Flemming and Stofer were cloning only it was Adrian Conrad's symbiote they cloned
Why did we not sense them
there is no naqahdah in their blood
there is way too many of'em
Get back here
i will see if i can translate more
Affirmative
Hold it
Leave the weapons on the dash
Put your hands in the air and get out of the car
what is this
Get in the van
where are you taking us
Back to the motel
we want you out of town by daybreak
i am Agent Cross
that is Agent Singer
NlD
so you know what is going on here
we have monitored it for three months
they are waiting till the ship is complete
it will be our first line of planetary defence
you set this whole thing up
no just took advantage of the situation
Immunitech cloned the symbiotes then there was an accident
we figure Flemming got infected then went after the other townspeople
Flemming is the one who tipped us off
the symbiotes are immature
they are too weak to assert permanent control
but when the hosts go to sleep they take over
when people wake up the next morning they are tired but none the wiser
that is why Flemming was on amphetamines
you get a ship but what of the people
we have ways of dealing with them
we will report this to SGC
Go ahead
this is no rogue operation
we have the full support of our superiors
when it is over we will have succeeded where the SGC failed for five years
we have all the angles covered
Sam
Sam
they took her
you have to do something
we have a containment team on stand by
we can have this town quarantined in 45 minutes
then do so
Your operation is blown Agent Cross
the symbiotes know we are onto'em
this is Cross
we have a code six
i repeat a code six
this is not a drill
we just lost 500 years of technical advancement
it is much worse than that
Sam
you all right
what is going on
you should only speak when spoken to
OK
Welcome brother
do you know where you are
i have the memories of my host
Good
when the containment team gets here you and Singer will take the symbiotes and report back to NlD headquarters
what about the rest of us
we will be detained
it will only be a matter of days before we have taken control of the organisation
that is an ambitious plan
Easy OK
Sorry
the irony is we only wanted to get off this pathetic planet
but when we realised they were watching us we came up with a new plan
Wait
Major Carter was writing a report on her computer
it would be better if the containment team did not find it
Get the computer first
should we use these two as hosts
no
this one is Jaffa
Shol'va
you should be serving your god
Apophis the false god is dead
Really
what about this one
he is an alien
the humans do not really trust him
we will have to kill them
Sergeant Krieger
Agent Cross
what is our status
Perimeter's in place
we are ready to round up the citizens
Excellent
Agent Singer and i need transportation to headquarters
i will call in the chopper
Get out of the car
Keep your hands where we can see'em
i am Major Carter United States Air Force
i have important information for Agent Cross
Let her through
Why are you here
you were supposed to be detained with the others
Major Carter's more valuable to you if she hasn't been exposed
that was not part of the plan
no she is right
while we are taking over the NlD she can infiltrate Stargate Command
it is too risky
you worry too much
the humans have no idea what is going on
oh i would not exactly say that
you guys are not nearly as smart as you think you are
i translated enough of the writing to know Immunitech had engineered the symbiotes with a built in kill switch a susceptibility to a particular antibiotic
the syringe
so we had it all along
when i saw the Goa'uld coming
i had nothing to lose so i injected myself and it acted like a vaccine
Took a few minutes to kill the symbiote then i just played along
we had similar results with the townspeople
they responded positively
each dead symbiote will break down and be absorbed into the host body
do the townspeople recall these events
as far as they know they were inoculated against an outbreak of meningitis
so what about the ship
it is been transferred to Area 51
Even though it is not complete it may still prove valuable
all right
Dismissed
so when we were in the sheriff's office you were in complete control
that is right
and you felt it absolutely necessary to really slap me
i had to make it look good
Let's get some lunch
Visiontext Subtitles
Natasha Cohn
ENGLlSH www tvsubtitles netWhisper of Sin
i do not really understand
Schizophrenia seems the worst
is Clerambault more horrible
Kandinsky Clerambault Syndrome much has been written on it
Thinking becomes muddled speech can be incoherent
Interpretational ravings can occur
Your husband can be aggressive
he can be dangerous especially to you
you are young beautiful
everything is ahead of you
Maybe i should not say this
Sacrificing yourself for an incurable mentally ill patient it is pointless
his illness will progress
the wisest is divorce
no
i dreamed you killed yourself
Vika it will get bad i won't be there
before taking your life Remember you did it many times in another life
Death is not worth much hope
Suicide is a loss of the gift to forget
leaving only a vital unspeakable memory
you will be unable to close your eyes for you will become one great eye with no lid but so many pupils
Vika remember this oh Vika
in the name of the father the Son and the Holy Spirit
Amen
the Lord be with you
my brothers and sisters to prepare to celebrate holy Mass with pure hearts
let us call to mind our sins and ask God's forgiveness
i confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters
i have sinned through my own fault in my thoughts and in my words in what i have done and failed to do
i am guilty i am guilty
i am very guilty
i am ready to hear you
i do not know how to start
Just start that is all
Ask me something
i do not know what to say
i loved one person
a person now gone
i want to forget this person
is this person gone only as far as you are concerned
Only me
was it a man
yes he is a man
does he have a name
his name is Paulius
was he your husband
no but i loved him very much
do you still love him
no
yes
i do not know
i want to forget him
Vika
was it good with me
i feel like i am in church
i so much wanted this time to be special
this is our last time
Forgive me
Did something happen
nothing
Paulius
no
you always forget who i am
me
Forget
Let me remember
you are a priest the one who hears my sins
you see i remember who you are
you are the one who forgets
that is why i am becoming a monk
what will that change
Responsibility
what about being responsible for me
you must choose
i did choose
it was not you
Vika
Vika please understand
i can not do otherwise
i do not want to
i do not want to
Paulius i do not want to
do not look at me like that
do not leave please do not leave me
Vika what are you doing
what did you do
it hurts
i want you to hurt
i knew
i could feel it
i knew the day would come
the priest fucking me will say Today is our last time
i knew by heart what I'd tell you
so now i am telling you
do not leave me
do not go away
Paulius do not leave
Played around had your fun and got rid of me is that right
it won't be so easy to drop me dear priest
my God Vika i am begging you
do not say God's name in vain
Obey all God's commandments
Get out
Live well and be happy
Just know this
i will know this and i will live
Good
Let's formulate this problem
you want to no longer love him
i want to no longer love him
i do not want to love him
what is the difference
i want to forget him cleanse myself
i want to heal
you will forget me soon enough Vika
Paulius i really will forget
God i can not imagine tomorrow
you will wake up wash up have breakfast and go to work
Tomorrow i do not need to go to work
Tomorrow you must go to the hospital and visit your husband
you talk like a priest
anyway i love you
what happened after Paulius left
i was nauseous
i crawled to the bathroom
i did not vomit
i saw my image in the mirror
it reminded me of Paulius
do you look alike
no
i reminded myself of him
Waiting for him I'd stare in the mirror
Paulius was never on time
before we met i looked very different
he made me anew
he was everywhere
he was on my lips
he was in my eyes on my face
i wanted to cut up change my face
you did not cut yourself up
i wanted to throw up
as i said i crawled over and laid on kitchen floor
and after that
i could not go back in the room back in bed where we last made love
i drank cognac
i smoked
i gulped sleeping pills
i am cold
Vika
Paulius how much time is left
Vika you have died
there is no time
Want me to open the window
Fly Vika fly
you have died
Fly
Thank you
can you give me
how would you explain this dream
i think that person wants to kill
who
me
Kill me within himself
is an hour over
i am tired
OK let's meet Thursday
Uzi
Uzi
Uzi
Paulius was a wonderful lover
before Paulius
Love games were like chess
I'd consider it all the passion the orgasms
it was different with him
when we were together it was as though I'd leave my body
I'd hover by the ceiling
I'd watch myself squirming on the floor or in bed
i did not recognize myself
Uzi
Aw who is this poor baby
where is your owner huh
are you all alone poor doggy
where is your tag
Good doggy
oh you good good boy
where was he
i am not telling
Wait i owe you
i am in a rush
Wait a burr's on your coat
it is roots used to be a diuretic
this plant treated genital diseases
Uzi and i want to thank you
Let's go to a cafe
we are colleagues
Only i work with the dead
what profession is that
it is a calling like a priest has
a philosopher
in a sense yes
i know all about the inside of a person
i am a pathologist
but death is a pathology
i do not get it
it is just as natural as life is
you do autopsies on people
yes but mostly on children
Usually on newborns or dead borns
what are dead borns
they died before birth or at the time of birth
it is not an easy craft right
Colleagues call me Leo the butcher
but i do not get mad
Leo the butcher now i remember
i have heard about you
Poor recommendation i bet
Women talk a lot about men in my office
Maybe i will come by
i won't be an easy patient
a few details i am divorced
my ex wife won't let me see our child
Why not
she thinks that corpses make me stink
but babies have no odor
it is like dissecting angels
Thank you but i have got to go
Your eyes are beautiful
but you should get a good hair stylist
Thank you
you are welcome
i do not have time for myself
no no more wine
i will get drunk
you won't get drunk
i have no time for myself either
by the way we'd be a fine couple
us a couple
Why not
no i have a husband
Seems you haven't had one a long time
he got lost somewhere
Maybe so
but i want no changes
without good cause
this is my address
we meet every Saturday in the park
Join us
we are great company
what kind of company
two shepherds a schnauzer a collie
no i have no dog
so buy one
all right
See you
Daina
do not start in on me
i haven't said anything yet
then do not
i know what you want to ask
what do i want to ask
where do i live
have i eaten
Am i fucking whoever
Am i pregnant
i want to ask when will you come home
i haven't lost my key
no need sitting around waiting for me
Very well do you have money
Take this
in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
Amen
i do not love my crazy husband
i love a priest
i know it is a mortal sin
we will both burn in hell
i curse the entire male race
this is also a sin
but they deserve it
Father you men go nuts about a penis a phallus dick whatever
Seems it is not a part of your own body but an almighty a willful demi god hidden away in your pants
to hear men talk about it
he is tired raise him from the dead
their expressions shoving their treasure into some mouth
like children sharing their sweets
Shut up
do not torture yourself or me
all right
no more torture
Live on peacefully and happily
and you live on too
i will live by your grace my priest
i absolve you
in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
Go in peace
the news yesterday read woman hung self in her husband's wedding tux
what story was she telling the world
was that good
it is always good with you
you are lying
Six months i did not touch you
you never missed it
Why not
you are always busy i am often tired
you know yourself
Rita i have another woman
Tomas
Tomas
it is middle age crisis
it will pass
i had so many cases like this
other diagnoses happen too
you know that as well
no no i do not want to change anything
i am leaving to live with her
when
Pretty soon
what about Daina
Daina knows everything
you told her before you told me
yes we talk from time to time
and what about me
you will be fine
you are an active woman
oh sure
yes
yes of course
Tomas
Let's buy a dog huh
Rita is your daughter home
no
a girl on the stairs murdered
i am scared
you go look OK
one version 3 guys plus the accused went into the cafe at 6
the victim made a call to emergency we got that
you are her mother
no
i do not know about this
i did not see any of this
i can not help you
we do not need your help
Walk around
Question
how did all this start
Why do i have to remember all over again
all i want is to forget him
what is hardest to forget about him
is that important
yes
what did you love the most
was it his soul or his body
his body of course was the best
i know that is what you want to hear
may i smoke
no you may not
to you it means a craving for oral sex
that is your interpretation
how did you meet this person
Need it in detail
yes
Go you are due to record at three
you are bothering us
do not you realize you are in the way
Get out of here
my husband is mostly in the hospital
we all call him Go
he thinks he is like
Gauguin
Van Gogh and Toshiro Mifune
a year ago I'd visit him and he'd talk about a special priest
You'd think every Sunday a holy man stepped into the nuthouse
he called him Father
Father Paulius
Your husband and i talk often
we have interesting conversations
i am Father Paulius
i heard of you
Go told me about you
i can give you a ride
do you feel safe with a woman
Why do you ask
Forgive me if i am out of line
a priest affects a woman
it is the taboos the celibacy the vows
a gift from your husband
oh on that promised street
White lilies on your breasts
all awash in plant like green
where are we going
we will see
then i felt an indescribable emotion
Paulius felt it too God sent him
i yearned from him care and safety
i thought we would not cross over a line
Paulius became the one to hear my sins
a sin must be heard and redeemed
Mortal was my every thought about him
oh stars pulsing thorns piercing
i sat thru the night
i wanted Paulius to take care of me
i imagined him as a father not only for a future baby but for me too
Paulius convinced the doctors and me
Go would feel better at home
Go wanted visits twice a week
the priest came to our home
more and more nightmares came to Go
i could not face having Go in an asylum
Vika
Somebody's by the door smiling laughing at us
a woman
Go want a drink
yeah
there is no one here
it is only me
Go
Blood
Why
you gave her your nightgown
there is no one here
no one here
you are not listening
no Vika i am
has an hour passed
no it hasn't
how do you know
the clock is not working
Right
it decorates the office
can i make a suggestion
no thanks
i am just looking around
you look lovely
something happened
Why
Give me your hand
Your palm is damp
if i am nervous my hands sweat too
i am not nervous at all
Young gals are usually afraid of me
they think they will never die
i like older women
they are closer to death
i am not ready to die yet
i need you alive not dead
Forgive me
this profession affects me
my reports are straightforward
Either an umbilical cord or grubby hands strangle a newborn
do you ever dream those misfortunate babies
sometimes
i do not want to talk about it
Let's change the subject
all right
so what happened in your life
my husband has a lover
oh it is middle age crisis
now i can hear you out
when did you find out
when did it happen
i do not know when
i found out yesterday
where you ever unfaithful
no
so i will be the first
no i won't need your services
Maybe i should go
we could sit awhile i could console you
what is there to console
i am just tired
Let's go to my place
i can cure your fatigue
besides i cook delicious breakfasts
no
Woman i just invited you to my bed
Thanks i have my own bed
Maybe next time
what if there is no other time
Too bad
Come in
there is a lack of a woman's touch here
no there is been plenty of women
i tried to forget my one and only wife
so you brought me here
with you i thought we'd talk not only do it
what an awful photo
what is it
Come on i will tell you
it is a brain of a newborn
Blood oozed in
it is a birth trauma
and this
it is a placenta
and this
it is an infant's heart
Pretty as a flower is not it
i do not understand why we are together
a man and a woman choose each other in three seconds and decide to be together or not
so who is first to shower
you
or maybe you
where is your shower
over there
Come here
Come darling
Won't you take off your robe
Come here
since my wife left me i take no initiative in bed
do whatever you like
no
Did you see last Tango in Paris
Vika i did not want to wake you or frighten you believe me
you won't believe my dream
i woke up in a cave
it stunk it was wet
it was like a womb
Fetuses swam around me
i have never seen such creatures
they grew incredibly fast
they kept multiplying
my prison actually the womb began quivering
Fetuses crowded forth
every time one left at the tunnel's end a light flashed
i could not get out in any way
i was the last to leave
when i left
Vika my mother two brothers and my three sisters
they laid dead
no not dead
they were lifeless
they were dogs
Vika it is unbelievable
i was born a dog a dog
after the hospital I'd wait for a call from father Paulius for the payback
i knew it would happen whether tomorrow or in a month in a car in a bed or at my home
it had already happened
the last step was to cross the bridge
are we close to the essence
yes Vika i hear you
i went to his home to borrow a book
the bravest horse ever belonged to
Alexander of Macedonia named Bucephal
the horse feared nothing except his own shadow
India built a monument to him
Caligula he was the one
he adored his horse
he made him a citizen put on the Senate and then nominated him a candidate to serve as consul
he slept on marble ate from ivory
masterpieces hung in his stable
do you know what Caligula means
a sandal of a soldier
Know the name of Caligula's horse
Initiate the fleet footed
Excuse me a minute
hello
no i do not handle that
i do not have time now
Goodbye
i will never understand what happened to me then
it was not a sin
it was a supreme secret
we were not together not alongside
we were one person
you might otherwise see that moment when life turns upside down
i am interested in all you say
Really
but i have already told it all
it is time for evening Mass
i will go with you
may i
no tonight i am busy
and tomorrow as well
Hey we barely know each other
what
Maybe sometime
another time maybe so
Hey little one there may not be another time
hi i am Vika
so what
we agreed to an interview
so what
but you promised
Hey
who let her on the set
Goodbye
then i wrote for a magazine
all my interviews with artists ended in love
Actually falling in love since the feeling
lasted no more than a few hours
sometimes it'd last a week a month
i had heard a lot about Go
Get away from me
hi there hello
here is your deal
do i owe you
no you do not
Great till next time See ya
Go you promised an interview
where my dear
here
Why not here
with somebody like you
I'd rather have it right here
then move over here
i am fine right here
Well if you are fine then fine
on that secret city street Full of flowers full of faults
as squirrel on wheel racing off and away i am flying
there is vines and spiders Expanses devoid of shores
Homes aloft like kites there is where is there is you wait
oh on that promised street White lilies on your breasts
all awash in plant like green
Naked on a windowsill you sit
Go was everything for me
i fell madly in love
i think he did too
a month later we married in church
he had a lot of women
when i had jealousy fits he'd tell me
you are my
L S L
last Sad Love
Why are not you whistling
you want a son
Masai men whistle when they want a son
Why do not you whistle
me
i am about to whistle
Want to run away
i must get to work
i am very angry
no woman ever ran out of my bed
i did not want to wake you
Forgive me
i will not
Did you see Empire of Emotions
Daina you came back
you look terrible
Gonna eat
i have eaten
i met a friend gabbed all night
i see it all
what do you see
where women come from so early
a lot you know
you do not wanna talk then do not
i want to but i do not know how
i won't ask where you have been
so do not ask
Only call our child worries
you are bright do not feel guilty
i do not and what about you
that is how it is Rita it can not be otherwise
OK Tomas OK
i will put your words over my bed
and their sight was restored
Jesus warned them sternly
' See that no one knows'
but they went out and spread news about him all over the region
the Gospel of the Lord
may the Gospel rid us of our sins
how did Paulius smell
Paulius
he smelled like mountain air
i am kidding good cologne
at times incense he brought this smell from church
when were you with a man to forget
the very next day
that soon
Want me to tell you about it
i do because you need it
Whatcha you doin' here
my cat ran away
Your cat's over here
Come on we will catch it
the cat's over there
i see ya got the experience
i won't surprise you
i wanna fuck an expert
Ya got syphilis or anything
no i haven't
Let's find that pussy
Whatcha pullin' your pud
a whore like you needs fucking
Spread your legs
Spread your legs bitch
Flamin' bitch gonna fuss
now ya gonna suck everybody off
Why did you go into that place
i thought if
i killed myself in a condemned building nobody would find me for half a year
i only imagined suicide one way to slice my veins
but that takes time too
every other way scared me
i was ready to do it but i was stopped
Did you tell anyone about this
i told Paulius in confession all in more detail than now
Why about that sleazy house
Why in church
Why in confession
i already said to confess my sin
i craved punishment
Why are you lying
it is no excuse not even to yourself
i am not
that is how it seems
Why lie to yourself
it was revenge
i do not know
i am not so annoying analyzing my deeds
Time to analyze
i said about the first time with Paulius
yes
the taste of sin was not then
then when
in church
Mass was in a few hours
we were alone in the sacristy
he told the choir boys put the new candles though they were nearly new
no do not
Forgive me Vika
then Mass began
i watched Paulius thinking
those hands caressing me are now blessing
those lips kissing me are now speaking the Gospel
i could not believe i was in church
lusting for him at the altar
i got your message
Did something happen
yes it has
i do not know how to tell you
do not explain who is guilty
are not you undressing
hello
no
i have Mass at six
i do not need your love only in a dream
i can not
can you try
i can not
you must forgive to forget him
Try one simple way
Just say this
Just say
i have no demands
i do not blame you
you do not need to change i will still live
i bid you farewell
with no pain with no sorrow
i forgive you
i want to vomit from this word
what am i doing here
Wasting my time for money
Wait i will help you
Just sit down
we will try another method
Calm down
i am relaxed
OK right OK
Let's push that man out like an object
Like what object
no matter
Concentrate try to imagine him
See him in front of you
See him
i do
Imagine him like an object
what object
any object answer quick
a grand piano
a grand piano
a grand piano big black shiny on wheels
on wheels i see
that is good
It'd better to see him as a small blue marble
i can not imagine him as a marble
he is a grand piano big black heavy
Play it often
often
how does it sound
Badly
have you tuned it
no Why not
i had no time
Play well
not very well Why not
Cause i never played in my life
i do not understand all this
Want to know my intimacies
i will tell you without these idiocies
it is only about a piano that is all
but i know enough
Smile now
oh look how bad we look
i am worried about you
you see
Everybody left us
Vika
it is hard for people to die easily who believed in their specialness
they sidestep between life and death
they can not dive into non being
Vika but there is no non being
Non being is full of light bliss and joy
the restorers do the ceiling
we fill in the floor set up the pews
we are out of here next week
what about the walls
it is too cold they won't dry
chose to leave that ill fated life
it simply
Did you suspect anything
about what
that Go is insane
no
i thought he could act strange
because he is Go
i needed adventures
i needed to escape
i had to run from myself
will you run the rest of your life
Go was also running
Go really changed
and it was not only his attacks of insanity
he stopped creating
he canceled his concerts
he started hating his guitar
he especially hated himself
Actually his songs died long before the asylum
Go already belonged there in the long halls stinking wards
Twilight hours of nightmares
Vika
how tired i got how hungry
my last sad love
but i conquered Satan
after that
what happened
i will never forgive myself
Go won't you whistle
Vika i feel so good
that is not mine
Right away
Go
Go jumped out the window
he broke his back
he is been a cripple since
Go
i am with you
while we fucked i remembered a time in my childhood
Once in winter i stuck my tongue on a door handle
Crying afraid i ripped it away
now i feel that same fear
what fear
my dick might get stuck in your eternally frozen land
Why you
i want no attachment to you
i do not want to be rejected
I'd rather do the rejecting
this is our last time
that is all
so i am a worthless woman
Understand a women and a lover it is not the same
each woman is not a good lover
that takes talent
Leo you are sick
it is best to trust a God
i am just a middleman
i came to you
Paulius i am sick
anything serious
it is serious
i will die soon
who told you this
the doctors
it is a female thing
when did you find out
Today
it is so bad to think about death especially every night
Hold on you just said the doctors said today
i knew long ago i would die
Today i was told there is a way out
what is it
i must give birth
Good way out
you will be a good mother
i need your child
Specifically by doctor's orders
do not make fun of me
Am i the one making fun
you know it is impossible
it could have happened many times
any women in my place would have done it
i did not want to fool you
because i love you
you must understand
it is impossible
Why
Why
it is clear you did not think about me
how can i live here knowing i have a son in this city
how will i feel passing your home
Consider it calmly a few days
Take a month a half year
it will seem different
no
Definitely no Vika
what should i do
you are an attractive woman
Talk to another man
and you suggesting that
Forgive me Vika
i love you Paulius
i want your baby
Vika Stop it
Please
Vika what are you doing
i will drive you home
i love you
i want your baby
i am begging you Vika
i need your help
Everything's falling apart
everything
what
this is not desire
this is
Sorrow Heartache
Leo
Why did you hang up
Say something
you complained something i did not say
what was that
i love you
now we won't owe one other anything
Hold on
how can i go on living
it is like it is Vika
it can not be otherwise
i want it to be otherwise
you never satisfied my one desire
you never heard my one plea
Maybe you were not obliged
we owe each other nothing anymore
i make no demands of you
i do not blame you
you do not need to change i will still live
i bid you farewell with no anger with no pain or sorrow
so who ya wanna see
Nobody
i am looking for a cat
we gonna find your cat
do not hurt me please
Understood
Right away
Hold on
Wait
Just please do not hurt me
that smell
it is my perfume
Richka never had this kind
i ain't gonna hurt ya
Sit
got problems
Say the word Richka i got problems
and Richka'll fix'em
Just say what ya want
i can bite through brakes
burn down a house
pound kidneys till he pisses blood
Say what ya need
who hurt ya
Sit
hi
Did something happen
something happened
you have got to find another therapist a better one
i am sorry
Come inside
i do not know why you are all leaving
Go Paulius now you
you must help me
you are obligated to help
you want me to end in an asylum with Go
you have to help me
i can not help Vika i cannot help you
i have no right at all to treat people
i need help myself
i am leaving
i just do not know where
off to the desert
Maybe
i do not want you to treat me
you do not help me nor feel for me
Rita
do not leave me
i do not need a doctor
i just
i need a person
a person who would understand excuse me or condemn me
Rita i am asking you do not leave me now
i need a friend
it is not possible
the Honor Code of Psychiatry doesn't permit friendships with patients
what shit
Paulius did not ask a bishop to let him fuck me
Read something
the only thing i have is the Holy Bible
OK
no Go I'd better leave
Read i said read
i asked you to read
the Gospel according to John no
13 line 21 find it
after he had said this
Jesus was troubled and testified
' i tell you the truth one of you is going to betray me'
one of the disciples whom Jesus loved was reclining next to him
Simon Peter motioned and said
' Ask him which one he means'
Leaning back against Jesus he asked
' Lord who is it'
Jesus answered
' it is the one to whom
i will give bread when i have dipped it'
then dipping a piece of bread he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot
as soon as Judas took the bread
Satan entered into him
Jesus told him
' what you are about to do'
Stop pretending
what is happening to you
you do not tell me everything
it doesn't matter
i am tired
Let's go to sleep
i can not sleep
Vika
i can not sleep i am afraid
i am afraid to dream
you know
i have never
i have never loved anyone
and no one ever loved me
i never took a risk for anyone
i can not help anyone
is your opinion so bad about yourself
no need to get hurt to help the injured
it is necessary
everything is just starting
what
i will tell you when i reach bottom
i am forgetting Paulius
i forgave him
he left me
that is it
then i helped
Maybe not how i expected
but it doesn't matter
at times you can not know who is a victim who is a tormentor
you must do one thing
what is that
you must divorce Go
Maybe
but the more i think about it the more i know i can not escape
he is my just reward
then i can rest
Why
you won't kill yourself
i am going out to the desert
that means into apathy absolute apathy
Body of Christ
Body of Christ
Body of ChristFletcher Ridge illinois

Thanks mister

i do not want to talk about this anymore
Damn it Sarah we do not have a choice
Cam we do not need to be making these arrangements
the hell we do not
These people at the hospital already showed they do not care whether us Larsens live or die Billy come on

Mister
all units hostage situation at Saint Mary's Hospital
Men considered armed and dangerous
Billy hurry up and get those windows painted
Nobody moves and nobody gets hurt
we are all gonna be here awhile so just get comfortable
all medical personnel
Prepare to evacuate all non critical patients from the first floor
how you doin' Pop
Keep evacuating
Everybody sit tight and wait for my command
if there is a clear shot you let me know
Well that is an interesting philosophy
Shoot first ask questions later
who are you
Special Agent Jarod Jackson Chicago F B i
i am the hostage negotiator
this is my show now
Damn
there are Pretenders among us
i was taken from my family
36 hours and he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others
how many people died because of what i thought up
since i broke out i have spent every moment searching for my past
he is a Pretender
a genius who can become anyone that he wants to be
the Centre wants him alive
Preferably
he defends the weak and abused
Life's a gift
you a doctor
i am today
Best we can figure there is a half a dozen people being held
Including three patients in the seized wing that could die in the next few hours without treatment
Kill that alarm
the hostage takers
Billy Larsen
he is 21
Good kid with no priors
Big brother Cam's 28
he is a hothead with a sheet that goes all the way back to high school
Weapons
Rifle and shotgun according to their sister
i will need her brought here as soon as possible
yes sir
they make any demands
nothing yet
what is your read on the situation
you are the big badge
you tell me
they have isolated the situation to a specific area of the hospital where their father is a patient
my guess it is some sort of grievance against the hospital
how do you figure that
Like you said i am the big badge
Let's go to work
this is F B i Special Agent Jarod Jackson
i want to talk to you about your demands
if you have got something on your minds now might be a good time to discuss it
this is between us and the hospital
you have got your father in there
Innocent people who need medical attention
Neither one of us want anyone to die here today
so why do not you tell me what you want and we can end this thing
i want you to write this down 41 342 17
not a penny more not a penny less
over and out
all right
i will see what i can do
Need to establish a direct phone line into that room
yes sir
what if they do not answer
Hell they could have already killed somebody and we'd never know it
where can i get blueprints of this building
i can get'em here 10 ten minutes
all right
i need a fiber optics video camera with a transmitter and microwave intercept
Hold on Einstein
this town has two red lights three hardware stores
Meaning
Meaning if you want a hammer i can help you out
you want to build a nuclear reactor you are outta luck
this town have an electronics store
that we got
i am going to make a list of things i need
Get these to me a S a P
Angel
Ugh
you weren't followed
Daddy you look oh i am sorry to scare you
Come on
Come on
Come on
Daddy what the hell is going on
Come on come on
Come on back here
Sit down
where have you been
Underground
this is the last place they'd look
now look
there is a strongbox in SL 22
in a panel behind the fire hose
Strongbox
yeah
it is filled with cash
Bring it to me
but do not tell anybody
Life and death understand
no i do not
Brigitte and i had to leave our hiding place
i need the money to last us a few weeks
Daddy if i knew why you were running
what
Bad news
Jarod never showed up for his shift at the U P S job
we missed him
Lyle
he is looking for you and he is peeved
what else is new
i want you to keep searching for Jarod
i will be back as soon as i can
Daddy
this whole thing is gonna turn into a nightmare
Nobody's gonna want to get treated at the O K Corral
who are you
Rebecca Simons hospital administrator
Dr Stephen Franklin chief cardiologist
they spoke to the Larsen boys before they pulled their guns
i am listening
Family brought their father
Jake Larsen
he was complaining of chest pains
Family thought it might be a heart attack
he was admitted to C C U
yes yes
i diagnosed him with a type of arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation
it is painful but it is not life threatening
Apparently his sons had a different opinion
Maybe i should have kept
Mr Larsen one more night to ease their minds
does this figure mean anything to you Doctor
41 342 17
not in particular
what is it
that is a good question
Agent Jackson there are patients in there who will die in the next few hours if left untreated
Excuse me
Sarah my name is Jarod
the man with the telephone
i am with the F B i
i think it is safe to say that neither one of us woke up this morning expecting to be here
i realize that you are going through a very difficult time right now
but i have to understand
Why are your brothers doing this
Look i want to end this thing without anybody getting hurt
but the truth is i can only hold those men off for so long
Move over there
Get that door
everything was always pretty crazy in our family
but things seemed to really come undone after Mom died
Especially for Cam
Your mom was here at this hospital
Same room where Daddy is
she was so sick when they sent her home and she died a few days later
and now your father's here
Look my brothers may be doing the wrong thing but they must be doing it for the right reason and i am not gonna help you kill them for it
Agent Jackson
got the equipment you wanted
all right
Let's see what is going on in there
what are we gonna do Cam
i am thinking
i am thinking
i hope you know what you are doin' big brother
i do not get it
sometimes it helps to be a fly on the wall
or in this case the airvent
Grab those blueprints
this will give us a better sense of the space where the hostages are being held windows exits
i will be damned
i could use this to get a clean shot
i have men on the roof next to the seized wing
is not it your job to consider everybody's safety
my job is to save the lives of those civilians inside
if i hesitate and one innocent person dies it is my fault
i won't make that mistake
the sheriff seems a little on edge
he has his reasons
Cam
what the hell do you think you are doin'
i know what i am doin' Pop
you would not be here if your mama was still alive
Well she is not and i am
Stop talkin'
Just get some rest
Man there are guns and badges all over the place down there
Well what the hell did you think was gonna happen
Come in here with guns they'd leave a parking ticket on our car
Just keep lookout
Sheriff says kill the air and the lights
you two get down
what now
yeah
Cam
this is Agent Jackson
Turn the lights and air back on
all right i will give you what you want and you give me a couple of hostages
Why should i trust you
you have my word
no harm will come to you or your brother as long as we keep talking
it is going to get really warm in there
now do we have a deal
Cam
you can trust me
Cam
Talk to me
Get down
Everybody get down
i had Cam's trust until your sniper got trigger happy
Hey
Cam Larsen is not a man who can be trusted
he incited a riot while he was in prison
Did you know that
the guards were beating the prisoners and they were convicted on brutality charges
Did you know that
i got Cam on the line
Cam
are you guys crazy
i had nothing to do with that shooting i swear to you
Look i it is important that i come in there and speak to you face to face
i am not here to talk
i am here to save my dad's life
Understand
it is too hot in here
Turn on the air now
yes
yes i will turn the air conditioning back on i promise
now can i come in there
okay
but just you
Unarmed
Ten minutes
all right
Ten minutes
those are Cam's kids
i had them brought in
to get under his skin
to get into his heart
what
where are you
never mind
Did you find Jarod
i was scanning police chatter in Fletcher Ridge and i came across a hostage negotiation situation there at a hospital
F B i involvement
and
it sounded like something that Jarod would be drawn to so i i contacted the Chicago office of the F B i Let me guess
no F B i involvement
if there were any agents on the job there they would have come from the Chicago office and they hadn't sent anybody
he never left town
Get the jet ready and i will be back as soon as i can
what about Lyle
Lyle who
Hmm
i love ice cream
i want to help your dad but i am going to need your help to do it
last night Daddy was yelling at Billy and Sarah
he was angry
he said the hospital was gonna send Grandpa Jake home to die
Just like they did Grandma
he said they were murderers
Murderers
Looks like you just lost a tooth
it fell out
are you going to put it under your pillow
for the tooth fairy
Tonight
Wow
how much you figure you are gonna get
Mm
Maybe a dollar
a dollar
how would you
like to make five
it is Agent Jackson
i am coming in and i am unarmed
Check him out
he is clean
could have got somebody killed shootin' in here like that
that was a mistake
that officer has been removed from the line
we are not exactly talking about an elite police force out there
Tell me about it
so are you ready to end this thing Cam
Get your father taken care of
i know you care about him
that is why you are doing this
you do not know nothin'
Why do not you explain it to me
41 342 17
that is an odd price to place on somebody's
life
it is not my price
it is theirs
oh she is gettin' worse
Hey hey
so what are you gonna do
you gonna keep her here and let her die
her life for your father's is that it
Cam maybe we should let her go huh
Billy shut up
you are not a killer Cam
you let this woman die and you are going to spend the rest of your life in prison
you and Billy here
Think about your children
my kids
they won't understand this
can not believe how much your little boy looks like you
you talked to my boy
It'sprocedure
oh Cody
he asked me to give you this
so how much do you want me to leave for him
how much
Money
from the tooth fairy
Right
Tooth fairy
you got a dollar
all i got's a five
Give it here
you are gonna give him five bucks for a baby tooth
Just give me the money
you walk outta here now you can still put this money under your son's pillow yourself
i can not leave him
Man you do not get it do you
this is not just about my father
it is about every person out there who is sick and deserves to be treated with dignity
they are gonna send this man home
does he look like he should go home to you
at least give me a hostage
you gotta work with me here Cam
there are a lot of people out there looking for any reason to shoot you and your little brother over here
all right
Take that lady
Take her
Help him
Unhook her and get her out of here
what about the others
one at a time
Allright allright allright
one at a time
you are doing a good thing here Cam
if some of those patients do not get treatment real soon we could have a disaster here
Meaning
Maneuver Cam to a window
one shot and it is over
Why is it that you feel that bullets are the only option
one shot
Deputy may i have a word with you
what is your name
Lindsay
L Lindsay Tyler
should not bite your nails Lindsay
it is a bad habit
i know
Y you do not remember me do you
should i
Cindy Perkins
Junior high school Sadie Hawkins dance
i asked you to dance once and you said yes
i had stringy hair braces
yeah yeah
you chased me around the gym all night
what was that 10 15 years ago
you kept asking the band to play your favorite song
Dream Weaver that is a damn fine song
you know my dad died of heart problems
Th that is why i went into nursing
Your father sort of reminds me of my dad
Look Cindy

Agent Jackson
Agent Jackson
Cam it is Agent Jackson

40 seconds
Dad remember when i was five years old how you used to take me hunting up near Patchett Lake
i am going to 360 joules
Keep talking
Used to wake me up early while it was still dark out
i used to hate gettin'up so early but you said it was important to get out before the sun
Clear
you told me that a sunrise in the woods was as close to God as a breathin' man could get
Remember when you said that
Remember that Dad
one minute
Clear
Come on old man
Fight
do not give up
Fight
70 seconds

Hang in there

Come on pop
i am getting a pulse
they really train'em up there at the F B i Academy
Let's get a closer look
what the hell was that
what the hell happened
i do not know
the signal went dead
Look Cam
you have made all the right choices up till now
Let me take another hostage out of here
okay
yeah
you Cindy
Go home
no
what
i do not leave until you do
for my father
i i will go
i have got to get that picture back

you have been watchin' us the whole time
i should blow you away right now
i knew i could not trust you people
no no
no
Cam
not like this
all right
Get out
Take her with you
no more talking
Just get out
you all right
yeah
Please take care of her
are you out of your mind
Hey it was an accident
you could have gotten all of us killed in there
we can not keep pushing him
Why can not you get that through your head
i have had a belly ful of you
oh yeah
and what is that supposed to mean
you are the big badge
you figure it out
Alice
Get me the number for the F B i office in Chicago
i doubt you will find Miss Parker searching through her desk
we saw her this morning
i think she had some errands to run
she did not say where she was going
you know your sister
you know she dances to the beat of a different drummer
so i have noticed
you two would not lie to me would you
so a anybody see the uh Redskins game this weekend
Agent Jackson
any idea when i might be allowed back in my office
no idea
oh
that is very impressive the way you handled that code situation
i did not have much of a choice did i
Tell me something
how are insurance claims processed at this hospital
in the middle of a hostage situation and you are wondering about billing procedure
i am just curious
for instance an H M O claim
H M O' s rely on the information provided by the attending physician
so a particular medical procedure would be approved or denied based upon your recommendation
yeah that
and the recommendation of the facilities administrator
Rebecca Simons
in the case of this hospital yes
what percentage of major surgeries have been denied at this hospital
oh i i do not know
Take a guess
i i do not know
Fifty percent
Sixty eight percent
11 percentage points higher than the national average
Why do you think that is
Maybe there are just a lot of healthy people in this town
Maybe
uh we need to talk
you look like hell
that is the way it is when you are dyin'
got yourself in a real mess here boy
Like everything else in my life
Look maybe i did not do the things i should have when you were small
Hell i i was makin' it up as i went
but i taught you kids right from wrong
i did that
i am tryin' to save you Dad
Why
because we are a family
i never knew my own old man
not more than a smack in the head now and then
i just did the best that i could and
when your mama died
i think a little bit of me went too
Guess we have been fightin' the same pain
i miss her
every day
me too Pop
41 342 17
this is the exact amount this hospital charges for heart bypass surgery
what are you talkin' about
Jake Larsen has sky high levels of creatine kinase enzyme in his blood
so
his fingertips are blue from lack of oxygen
i still do not follow
he has heart disease
he is headed for a massive heart attack
his only chance of survival is heart bypass surgery
the same surgery this hospital denied him
who the hell are you
Excuse me
i called the F B i Nobody's ever heard of an Agent Jarod Jackson
Well it is a big agency
Maybe you talked to the wrong person
if any of those people in there die it is on your head
you understand what that means to have somebody's blood on your hands
as a matter of fact i do
and so do you
Your deputy told me about that hostage situation a year ago at the grocery store
the way you lured that perpetrator into the doorway and hesitated to take the kill shot
Did he tell you how that same hostage taker took his gun and shot to death a 15 year old stock boy
Did he describe the sick feeling i get every time i see that boy's parents on the street
you did what you thought was the right thing to do
and an innocent boy
lost his life
that is the blood i have on my hands
Agent Jackson
Certainly has been a long day hasn't it
Agent Jackson
i was wondering if you and i could have a little talk
oh well the truth is i am late for a meeting
Perhaps later
i know about the cover up concerning Jake Larsen's coronary disease
but what could an H M O possibly have to gain by such a cover up
i saw you and Dr Franklin arguing in the parking lot
i know what is going on
we could talk about it here in private or we could go downtown and talk under the glare of the television cameras
it is up to you
is it just for the money
or is it something more personal
i see the way you and Dr Franklin are together
my girlfriends and i used to dream about meeting a doctor
Falling in love and living happily ever after
i actually believed that is the way it would be for Stephen and me
Your signature is on the release forms for all the patients in question
i made my decisions based on Franklin's recommendations
i looked the other way in one case next thing i knew i was
all for money
Franklin was getting kickbacks from the H
M O' s for not doing expensive surgeries
by denying certain procedures to critically ill patients he saves the H M O hundreds of thousands of dollars
and makes a nice percentage
i swear to you
i did not know about Jake Larsen until his sons took over the hospital
Franklin said that you questioned him and he threatened to expose me if i said anything and i was afraid
not half as afraid as those patients who were sent home to die
the key you gave me doesn't work
Really
huh
must have given you the wrong one
here let me try this one
yep
that works
Angel i am sorry i had to drag you into this
Baby Parker Wh what was that
oh it is nothing
it looked like a medical record
it is ancient history
it is mine or Lyle's
it doesn't matter
Trust me
some day when i have more time i will explain everything to you
but right now i need your gun
my gun
this is about that hit out on you
yeah the bastards are closin' in
who ordered it
i do not know
i do not know
i do know this is the only thing that really matters
it is the future of our family
it is the heir to the Parker name and it is growing inside Brigitte
the baby'll be here soon
what else can i do
Well the key is still Jarod
Bring him back and it will be just like it was
i am on my way
yeah
Dr Franklin
Agent Jackson
Cam and Billy Larsen have tapped into hospital records and are trying to find information about patients who were denied care
can you cut them off
we tried
i suggest i download everything
i would not want you to lose any patient records
no
no i will handle that
i i know which files are important
can i get back in my office yet
i do not think that is a good idea
Things are still pretty dangerous up here
i could not assure your safety
Dr Franklin
Dr Franklin
i am on my way up
if you think that is best
what happened
i was shot
the Larsen boys
they are crazy
they are coming down the hallway
they say they know who is responsible for trying to kill their father
i have gotta get out of here
Doctor
i can not breathe
my heart
what is happening to me
the same thing that you let happen to Jake Larsen
you are having a massive heart attack
what have you done to me
i laced your keyboard with a tricyclic antidepressant
it is absorbed through the fingertips
Speeds up the heart's rhythm
that is why i faked getting shot told you that the Larsen boys were coming down the hallway
i wanted to scare you
you see adrenaline it really increases the effects of the drug
Why
because of what you did to Jake Larsen
because of the drugs you gave him to cover up the symptoms of his coronary disease
who are you
i am everyone
i am no one
if you tell me the truth
i can bring your heart back to normal
Look we are all on the same side here
there is no reason to let this become a problem
oh it became a problem when you aligned yourself with an H M O that cared more about profits than taking care of patients
God Larsen would not have survived another year no matter what we did
that is not the point
you are a doctor
Your job is to give care not take it away
that cyanosis must really be setting in right now
you should really seek treatment
or you can die within minutes
Please
Please
how many people
how many people did you let die so you could stuff your pockets
all right i took kickbacks from the H M O' s to send patients home
now please help me
Please
Sorry Doc
but your claim has been denied
no
no
is he really gonna die
i just laced his keyboard with trigoxin
he has nothing more than a really bad case of heartburn
and he will probably lose bladder control for a couple of days
i am gonna drop some of the charges against the brothers
Let the judge deal with the rest
Considering the circumstances i think they have suffered enough for one family
i think you are right
Thank you for keeping me from doing something stupid
i guess we can not let the mistakes of our past ruin our future
will you excuse me Sheriff
Excuse me
are you from the Chicago office
are you a reporter
Blue Cove Gazette
have you been involved during the entire crisis
no i just arrived on the scene
there was another negotiator involved
our source from your Chicago office tells us he was an impostor
that is what we have been told
and where is he
no idea
i do not know how he did it but witnesses say he really knew what he was doing
Excuse me
it is your fault we missed him
now do not tell anybody
Life and death understand
Someday when i have more time i will explain everything to you
Well the key is still Jarod
Bring him back and it will be just like it was
you are gonna be held accountable for this Parker
i know
Let's go home

but his sentence just got extended
Sentence

because he made up stories

he bragged about himself
Said he represented top fashion labels went to Stanford came from a good family started his own business and won many honors
they are all true
i did not know so i made up stories
Did Daniel know before he died
yes and no
i did not tell everything

Why help me
you are my sister in law
Daniel loved you

Room 3 bed 19
it is this one
a young beauty
what a shame
Nobody escapes death
Officer what are you doing
we are told she will die in 5 minutes
we came to pick her up
who are you
what is it to you
i know her
so
this is not your business
no officer why her
she just barely escaped death
so she will die again
do not interfere with us
Leave
our order says it is her
is it possible you made a mistake
we never make mistakes
this is odd
Doctors said she will make quick recovery
it is not her time yet
anything can happen in 5 minutes
how
she is energetic and is eating a banana
Eating a banana doesn't mean she is energetic or she won't die
Ever heard of sudden death
but she doesn't have the look of it
there is a look of it
there is
i am an example
i looked different right before i died
See
then we will wait and see how she dies
Why not double check your order
Right we do not want any mistakes
Hurry check your PDA
i do not need you to teach me
then hurry
so
no looking
so
we will look ourselves
Correct
she is choked to death
it says she will choke on banana
no it says she will choke on plantain
but she is eating a banana
they are the same thing
Banana and plantain are different
they are
i think so
but look at the size of that
it is a plantain
Size doesn't matter
it is still a banana
it also says your subject is a man
the name doesn't match
Really
may Ho
it is true
but we have the right room number
is not this Kowloon Hospital
this is Hong Kong Hospital
Told you you were wrong
you just would not admit it
Calm down
you could've took her away by mistake
i wonder if this is how i died
we will be on our way
Kamen Rider again protects mankind from the Shocker

Did you really see something
then

he is a ghost too right
i made it up
there is no ghost
it doesn't exist
that is a relief
I'd hate to see Daniel as a ghost
if he were a ghost he would not want us to see him anyway
it was really a ghost you saw
the kid died when he was 13

Grandma and Tina thanked me

Tina even accompanied me to the bathroom
where did you learn that
you are over reacting
i did not touch you
i just slipped
but it is not right
i have a husband
how can you kiss me
we are friends
Elementary school friends
i thought you knew that
i am going to be reincarnated
so you really can see ghosts
Ever since the car accident
what are they like
they wonder about
there are many things they can not do
i have cancer
i have 3 months left
the company is up to you and Tina
i am not good enough
you just have to
there is no choice
i had my doubts about you
but after what happened to Tina
i think you have what it takes
you can do it

i told her last night
she cried all night
and hasn't stopped
Come on
Baby
Hand
may Ho i am leaving
Good bye
Ken
i said good bye already

you always come and go so suddenly
i bid you farewell
are you in a rush
Grandma is dying
i am a ghost
what can i do
it is fate
i want to see Daniel
he is a ghost too
there is nothing he can do
i want to see Daniel
Why did not you ask me until now
Fine
Daniel drowned in ocean so talk to the ocean
Go ahead
what do i say
Tell him the exact opposite of what you are thinking
Why
how would i know
that is the tradition
it is okay
Go ahead
Daniel
i do not miss you
do not come back
will it work
Whisky
what is this
it is Daniel's dog
it is really working
Daniel i have lived happily in the last few years
do not worry about me
i will take care of Grandma Tina and the company
Daniel i do not want to see you anymore
not one more look
not one more hug
can you hear me
can you hear me
i do not love you
i do not love you
i just want to see you and hold you
Why won't you come
he probably crossed the Twilight Junction
his memory is erased
it is too late to turn back
does this mean i will never see him
what you said to him was great
it is probably what Daniel would've wanted
Take good care of yourself from now on
because very soon
i will cross the Twilight Junction too
you will forget me too
i do not want to just leave
but i worry the longer i stay the harder it is to let go
before i go
can you give me a hug
how
i can not even touch you
Just pretend i am Daniel
how
Close your eyes and think i am him
Close your eyes
did not you always want to see me

i am from a smaII town where i spent much of my Iife being told to get a reaI job
after putting myself through school
i spent a few years working nine to five struggling to support my habit
and then one day i got a break
this story begins just after the end of my first show in New York

See if it works
Look i am not going to a clairvoyant okay

it is Italian
you gotta believe in something
what else you gonna do
i am going to find Violet and get my pictures back

Direction and camera
Piel Jutzi
a shadowy world of servants and slaves the slum quarters of the rentals without sunlight
the dusty street of the rest
Fairs the joys of growing youth
Taverns deserted nauseating ballrooms nursing night
Poor people disturbed distressed
Workers emaciated invalided empty with sunken eyes blinded
Indifferent apathetic staring
Drunk babbling beggars in the cold

Touching gray on gray dark

Darling opens the mind

These eyes see something wrong
Very bad
i am glad you are not on the jury
but i dismiss the contract of the gallery
my God
i am so nervous
i do not know why you have to host with the critics in your first sample
would be more than happy of patrocinarte
does not matter
Just do it for my boss
in addition some of these critics
are the highest authorities respected art in our country
this is the keyword
Critical

Judges are closer to my speech
Come on
Vamos

Out of my department
Out of your department
no more than a building left outside your department
but this is what i imagine when i clean the window

i am happy for Having a dismissed from the bar
because this is what you should do
i am proud of you
it is beautiful
has a palette as simplistic
there is no distinction
Studied at the Louvre two seasons and this is very simplistic
the Louvre
then it must be familiar with the chiaroscuro
Considered the motion Renaissance important
which clearly was inspired by this artist
and then increased with abstract aesthetics
with a touch of Death of the Virgin by Caravaggio
that is the most amazing thing someone has done for me
it is all true
Forget this critical

Just do the devil's advocate
Perhaps your name is Tommy
Maybe you and she
I'd remember
i would
can you John
These people walk Desperate for something

i have to admit i do not know
we will follow the trail crumbs right
okay
Let see what we find
there is a girl account with us

Excuse all this turmoil
i can bring some thing
a glass of water
this is gonna hurt
Excuse me
it is a precaution
a cup of coffee
we have some cinnamon delicious snacks
okay
Mr Doe my name is Sam
first i want to thank you for have cooperated so far
okay
Let's do this
must tell me all what you know about Phoenix
i am not referring to the city
who are you
i know this has been a little disturbing
but be sure when you i say it is in good hands
are you sure you do not want a cinnamon sandwich
they are very good
no bother
although deduct as out of here
there is an army waiting outside
40 gauge with 10 cm barrel
the government uses
Knows well the weapons
as i found out you know many things
how does it do exactly
Flash Cards
do you work for the government
if you expect to find his assistant
what do you know about it
if you did something i swear to God
Easy
i do not know where she is
i can appreciate what this may seem
but i hope we find the way to help each other
we need help
i do not know who you are or what they want
we just sit on my here in silence for all eternity
then on second thought
i think i am going to eat a snack of cinnamon
i implore you to talk to me
not for his safety but by Miss Kawalski
we can combine what we know what do you know
i work for a branch of the NSA
we seek an organization with ties to the Middle East
we follow their movements for some time
Especially since came on our soil
Naturally when they had a deep interest in you
John Doe Citizen not we fail to do the same
what is a problem because' re two steps back
we do not know what your goals are
Nor do we know who they are the main characters
have you ever contacted with any of these individuals
i will take that as a yes
how do i know that is who claims to be
no one knows not know
we live in a new age with new rules
and do not advertise of our interests
Especially if we avoid a catastrophe
what do you want
Answers

Why are not your records before September 14 last year
and can you prove it really is innocent of all this

i do not know
i am not one of them
this is a waste of time
i out of here and find Karen
okay agreed
See i have observed for a while
and i am inclined to believe that you are a Phoenix goal not a conspirator
but my superiors did not know what to think of you
Know your skills
i have seen
Know everything there is to know
so here is the deal
Bring people up here
to take samples
to check than they really are capable of
and hopefully i can convince for you to join us
a person like you can be useful
we then work together to catch the big red bird
do you really think will work with you
Even if you are who you say
you just have questions
i do not need your help
Well the offer is submitted
if you want to find Miss Kawalski the better you cooperate
Your loyalty to him is strong

Prime numbers

Mr Doe

Treatment to do my best
Maybe if i make the questions in multiple choice format
this is ridiculous
how do you explain the great interest Phoenix is that you
i thought about that
i think it is
for real estate
it is true
Probably the price in my area i climb through the roof
i think they want to scare me to leave my house
Doe i warn you
you walking down the ledge
i can bring witnesses testifying
which is a kind of walking encyclopedia
Wait
are you talking about those rare data i have in my head
it is exactly what we say
Why did not you say
yes my head is full of stuff
for example
Did you know that the American average eat 24 pigs a year
Speaking of pigs the pig has always a pair of breasts
Usually 12
in the U S malls 24 336 school bus come
a beaver can go without breathing underwater for 45 minutes
75 percent of men and women bathe in showers

we are in the same Doe
National interest

they are different from the group Phoenix
with lies secrets and
Well

John Doe is the only that escaped his lips
we must stop find this way

what happened to Karen
what do the people of Phoenix with me
Sorry

but before you know the next world
Deserve the truth

Everyday
Why
Why

LOVE MAKES ME STUPlD
sometimes i feel like sex reduces me to a state of slavery
it kills my freedom
it kills me
my problem is
I'd sleep with anybody
Men women short tall thin obese
you name it
i do not get it
i love my wife and kids but
i am proud of myself
i haven't visited porn sites in 12 days
Once it is not funny i found myself with a
and this self loathing makes me fuck even more
my head and my dick all the same thing
i am sorry
it is the first time i have talked about it
i called my sponsor and i prayed
i will stick with it
but he loved me so much
his eyes shone so brightly when he looked at me
He'd been pursuing me for months
i felt like i was needed
when a man makes me feel important
i spread my legs
i thought that loving meant spreading my legs to infinity spreading my legs to see the sky my little patch of heaven
i spread my legs to forget who i was forget the rejection
i spread my legs to shine like a little star
Kiki
Kiki Labrche

Plus my grandmother keeps falling
my roommate screws 24 7
Speaking of screwing when can you fit me in
this week's complicated my wife's off work
but about your novel Chapter one was great
Keep at it
Write with your guts tap into your pain
Keep using your family for inspiration
Your grandma's falling is a sign
my family
my childhood's stuck in my throat like a potato chip
my family
Even my shrink's fed up
besides Tcheky if i write about my life i will have to write about you
if i play in the field get down from my gynaecological tree
Well you are the field
Wait you can not write about me Kiki it is
the department's already talking
it would cause problems
Promise not to
Maybe i should change my thesis advisor
Maybe sleeping with you gives me writer's block
you know
i thought that
Seriously maybe it would be best
does your door lock
yeah why
Kiki
no
would you find me more exciting if i weren't your student
C'mon Kiki
not here
Look
or just a quickie
Fyodor
my little Fyodor

Caroline
i won't be the godmother of Fyodor Girard
i have never heard of a Fyodor
Dostoevsky doesn't ring a bell
the Idiot
Excuse me i will get your doctor
last week you called him Rjean
that has more charm
would you prefer Tcheky
Look Caro i know you do not like him but he is my literary therapist
oh boy
it is been a year i have stopped sleeping around
i hardly see my shrink
that is something
i just wish you had a normal love life
do you see a future with him
how do i know
anyway normal like who

Lesbian no lover orders a baby from a catalogue
at least nobody makes me suffer
i can not stay i have to do an interview
and see my mom
i did not go yesterday
and get Claude Viau at Gran's
she is not doing well
in short a thrilling life
Mikael
Caroline
Your order will be ready in an hour
Wait
Mikael I'd like to introduce my good friend Kiki
Mikael Robin from the pastry shop

Just say anything

i can start over from scratch
i can make believe that you made me shepherd's pie with home made ketchup
that we played airplane
and laughed when we fell off the bed
Right Mom
Mom
i can invent death too
Looking at you it would not be hard
but instead
i will tell you about my lit prof who puts his thick fingers in my crack and ejaculates on my breasts
are you jealous
as a mother are you jealous
Mrs Labrche come on open the door
Mrs Labrche
what is it
i heard a thump so i figured your grandma fell again
she won't open so i called 911
C'mon Gran

Old people need company

i will take care of her
she won't be alone
Goodbye

Happy birthday Kiki
Christ
Good boy we made it
my little girl
Mom and Gran cry all the time
i want to cry but for different reasons
it is my birthday and i am unable to cry
nothing comes
but Mom and Gran are good at it
they tell stories and start bawling
sometimes they do not even tell stories and they still bawl
to pass the time Christ
Gran
Come on
this time we are going to hospital to see what is wrong
i am warning you if you call an ambulance i will have a fit
here we go
Come lie down
and take off your boots
Finish up and we will hang your drawings
Very pretty girls
that is lovely
Kiki your drawing's very
it is ugly
Roger please
do not put it up
it scares me
those are my crazy mom's eyes
Really Kiki
that is no way to talk about your mother
Calm down dear
i think your drawing is very profound
it is very original
and there is a resemblance
but we will put it up in back where we do not see it
it is a bit scary
Happy birthday to you
anyway there is a pale blue cake for you in the fridge
Gran really do not you think we should call a doctor
i was just dizzy
i am not sick
it is old age
Stubborn mule
i went to buy your pale blue cake
i am tuckered out
Gran you did not have to go buy me a cake
Sure i know
You'd say i was ungraceful
the word's ungrateful Gran
anyway
Look there is a lady at the door
Kiki
Your mom's at the door
i think she is in her bathrobe
hi it is my daughter's birthday
it is Kiki's birthday
Happy birthday Kiki
you bunch of vampires
Freeloaders
Awesome party
Come look

Come look
Come see them

i am leaving Kiki
Antoine
Antoine
Why can not we make it work
' Cause you cheat on me with a crummy painter a shitty photographer and the girl next door
Antoine

Screw you
Beat it
Go on get the fuck out
you are goddamned fucking crazy
Get out
Get out
Good riddance
Antoine
Happy birthday Kiki
Christ
Hands began to touch me
Thousands of hands caressed my body
Finally someone was caring for me
i was queen of the party
a crowd cradled me like Mom used to do
long ago in a former life
i floated on the mother sea and sank into her womb
how are you
Suck me
Suck me
oh yeah i have a little present for you
here
it is not much
you remembered my birthday
do you like it
i can count the minutes between our rendezvous
you know Kiki
what i mean is
i am 25 years older than you
23 years and two months
you understand
what i wanted to tell you is
i do not have much time for you
you deserve better
Find a guy your own age build something
he will make love to you three times in a row
yes but
i like playing in my Oedipus Complex
it is time to go back in time to what is essential to your novel
you know i am jealous of your talent
i haven't written in five years
Shit i have to go
Tcheky
what
would you leave your wife for me
what did you say
Take me in your mouth
Suck me
it is warm in my mouth
but my skin is cold all over
his arms are so far away
he came in my mouth like in a Kleenex and my mouth and i stopped existing
i will roll up into a ball throw myself out because i wanted him to take me in his arms cradle me tell me reassuring words like everything will work out he is with me
with me
with me
but he left
he always has to leave
but he always comes back because he loves my love
i said i was stopping everything the sun from warming the moon from shining the oceans from being wet
I'd stop everything
I'd stop everything to be better good beautiful perfect
a dog in a cage on antibiotics
i really said I'd stop
i swear
but there was this guy with hands as soft as his penis who licked my feet
this guy with Indian blood drumming inside me
and this guy with his guitar who laughed when he came
and there was this boy who wanted to marry me have kids with me buy me a bungalow and vibrators to make up for what he lacked
this girl who scared me who resembled me and could have killed me to take my place
it is so damp
Gran
there are still cockroaches
that is it
i can pay we will call the exterminators
Forget it
little bugs do not eat big bugs
anyway i made you French toast
i have news for you Gran
little bugs kill my appetite
Kiki
i want to visit your mom
you sure Gran
you haven't visited her in years
Exactly
it may be the last time
Christ it is taking forever
what is this
i will ask the nurse where she is
i will come
no you stay here in case she shows up
i love you Kiki
i am scared i am crazy too Mom
i should've hung myself with your crazy umbilical cord
scared i am crazy too Mom
i should've hung myself with your crazy umbilical cord
Gran you are hurting me
you are a pest
you are hurting me
they locked up one of my girls
they won't take this one from me
Goddammit
this is the attic
they won't take both
i will put up a fight
i will hide her
Hide who Gran
who
Keep quiet we are here
Act normal do not be nervous
do not show'em you are nervous
they are all bastards anyway
Kiki
what a pretty drawing
Tell me about it
the two babies
do you have brothers and sisters
you are way off
those are Gran's two babies who drowned in their bath
so i drew a swimming pool for my two dead aunties
Why is the daddy all in red but not the others
Well the daddy's all in red'cause
Gran threw a brick and a colander at him and hit him right in the face
he is lying on the ground unconscious
this is the brick
but i do not know what a colander is so i did not draw it
but Mrs Labrche it is in the child's best interest
no you won't have her
it is not about having or not having
but of taking precautions
healing she is not crazy
Mrs Labrche
i already have one locked up
with time she will
could you please
she is not like her mother
you have to understand
do not you laugh
i do not know if i should cry or puke
i float in the unreal
when i stop watching TV
Mom just committed suicide
she took lithium carbonate Luvox
Dalman and Valium
all at once and she shouted
i love you all
Mom decided that day to end her life and everyone else's
Mom is my temporary interruption of TV service
she is the stick in my wheels
she chooses the best time for her stunts
that is how Mom is
she has to be the center of attention in the spotlight
every morning Cline meets me on the bridge
Cline is my all Bran buddy
my source of regularity in the chaos
Rain or shine Cline is there
hi Kiki
Cline
Mom took all her pills to kill herself
what
is she dead
not yet
we will find out tonight
what will you do
Gran may have to place me with a family
oh no
Poor you
you know what can happen
no what can happen if they place you
Gran says that if i am lucky and get a good family it will be OK
i will have lots of pretty dresses and ride to school in a limousine
but if i end up with a gang of madmen who only take in kids for the cash they will feed me unbuttered toast
and maybe the daddy of the house will play with me
Play with you
you know he will show me his cock
his cock
yeah
and make me take it in my mouth
the pig will stick it in so far that i will choke
no
that is awful
you have to do something
i will do something
i will bite his cock so he can not use it
Serves him right the goddamn pig
Cline could not stop crying
but i did not cry
i do not cry
i kept it for later lying on the bed of a cheap hotel after being screwed by a lit prof
Thank you
i love it
they look like candies
i want to eat them
Happy birthday
Speaking of eating know who dropped by
that tub Eric with his kid
he ran into you on the bridge
it was pretty intense
These days the ghosts of my past are coming out of my ears
Mikael
hi girls
for a change i brought you kind ladies a sugar pie topped with puff pastry
it is Pablo
he likes pastries i can tell
Pablo
Pablo Girard
yeah
Caro
that is so wrong
what a pain
you never like my ideas
it is hot
i will go back to my ovens
on that note ladies my warmest salivations
i will feel you later
Kiki Labrche
are not you interested in a poet
who can cook
a poet pastry chef who lives with Mom
Bravo
it is not afraid of other buttons
it is big as a diaphragm
Buttons are not just pretty
they set boundaries on the body
to each his or her buttons
and there was this girl
first i have to say i started therapy
this therapist flopped in her chair told me i had a sick personality
a personality with a cold
no worse
i had cancer of the personality
it is like a ball clenched inside me since i was little
so that girl meant nothing to me
Just another fuck no more
another taboo to defy because she was my best friend's girlfriend
Kiki
Caro
hello
Caro i did not want
Let me explain
you are so sick Kiki Labrche
Wait Caroline
Kiki what is going on
Come in
do not stand there it is freezing
if your wife was here I'd have said i was a Jehovah's Witness
is something wrong
Nice place you have
where are you going
i just wanted to tell you
i am unblocked
and
i brought you what i wrote
could not that wait Kiki
no it could not wait Tcheky
no need to choose i can keep you as my advisor
Stop it
you are being ridiculous
i want you to enter me
what is your game
Why are you here
i want you to bang me
my wife's coming back
are you crazy
do not ever call me that
all right
so what is going on Kiki
Tcheky
would you leave your wife for me
Jesus i do not believe it
Listen i have been clear from the start haven't l
no i won't leave my wife
there
you have to go she will be back any minute
Listen i do not know
we can meet tomorrow night at your bar
we have to talk
this Tomorrow at 8 00
Tomorrow at 8 00
Fuck you are as predictable as an American movie
and cheap porn flicks are not predictable
anyway you are a lousy lay
that is not right
i am not playing fair
i am hitting below the belt
because that is my field of specialty
i just can not keep in my feelings
they give way like vomit from a paper bag
Controlling myself's hard
i can not control myself i explode
i am my own bomb
my brain's a permanent Hiroshima
ln my wake a cataclysm
i am my own worst drama
Even worse i found myself without looking for me
i found myself and can not get rid of me since
so do not ask why i can not love
oh no not him
Kiki
i just want to talk
she doesn't want to
i want to talk to my daughter
she doesn't recognize you you bastard
Get lost
i just want to talk to her
hi Kiki do you recognize me
i am your father
Beat it
she is gonna have another fit
i am your father Steve
Beat it or i will call the cops
you are crazy and you will drive her crazy
Fuck
Kiki
Goddammit what is with you Kiki
C'mon get up
Lean on me
my bag
Claude Viau come inside
Take that off it is soaking
Take my sweater
Lie down on the sofa
Lie down
here this will give you a lift
Gran
i am very very tired
anyway you sure look a wreck
Stay as long as you want
Gran
Why can not i cry
Why are not i able to
is it because your two babies drowned
And'cause you and Mom wept all the tears in the family
i know i scare you Mom
but everything scares you
you are a victim
if you were an animal you'd be a lamb devoured by lions
if you were Russian you'd live in Chernobyl by the reactor
Mom
you have all the personality of a dishrag
but i am not a victim
so i scare you
you are scared of my screams and tears
as a child when i screamed and cried you worried they'd think you beat me
Neighbours would call the cops who'd take me away
what a proof of love Mom
but your 40 000 antidepressants help you forget
Forget you weren't there for me
but
i am not mad at you
no
because i am not a victim Mom
i am not a victim
hi my name's Kiki
and i am a private menace
Sorry i will do it properly
hi my name's Kiki
i am a sex addict and emotionally dependant
hello Kiki
i am addicted to anything to do with loving
i do not really know what else to say
Today i realized my only stable relationship's with Claude Viau my dog
Hold on do not get any ideas
i haven't done it with my dog
my relationship with my dog is purely platonic
Claude Viau is a boy i loved from afar from when i was 12 to 15
my first love
i wrote him hundreds of letters that i never sent
the day he finally spoke to me
i blew him off
Great start
it is weird
when someone loves me and
i should feel good comfortable i run away
and when it hurts
i cling
it is like it has to hurt
hello Kiki
can i join you
do you remember me
of course
Robin Hood
i warn you i am not hungry
Am i disturbing you or
it is funny i was passing by and saw you
Just as i was thinking of you
i think about you a lot
i do not know how to say this
it may not be the right time
it is a bit corny but
I'd like to know you better Miss
Cut the formalities
you can see i am here alone
i am all alone
and i am warning you i am a private menace
a private menace
are you safe
what
Safe
are you safe
Safe as in positive or negative
oh that safe
yeah sure
me too
Let's go to your place
Come on
do not walk so fast
you do not even know where i live
do you live far
no around the corner
OK look
Like this

See you i live this way
what had you pictured
i do not know
We'd get to know each other ease into it
Ease into it
you want us to talk
Want me to draw you a picture
no way
here is to spontaneity
Take the bull by the balls
me it is now right away
i want to fuck you tonight
Feel like it
my mother would not like it but
on one condition
that we get married have kids start a pension plan

it is a deal
so then can we kiss

shall we go in
i am thirsty
i want you to suck my breasts

and he made love to me with love

he made me breakfast with eggs and homemade raisin bread and fruit

i realized that for a year you have fucked me in seedy hotels but we have never had breakfast
i have never had breakfast with you
it is too much
i can not take it
hi there
Good boy
Gran
Gran
Gran can you hear me
Hold on a few more years
Let me call the hospital

Gran do not go
do not leave me alone with crazy Mom
Gran

i need to hear your grumbling

no children
i was married for four years
Mom's dead
Dad well he is my dad

and reckless

Bye bye
Kiki someone's here for you
i have been searching for you for a week
i was worried
my grandmother died

Kiki i wanted to tell you i
i read those chapters
they are magnificent
Magnificent
but it hurts
i was blown away
do you want to enter me
i do not want to enter you
i came to say i liked it so much i told a publisher friend
but
i ask
i will change the names and places
Thank you
Kiki you know it is
it is unbearable
we can draw it out
i care for you so much
you have to help me
we are toxic i am exhausted
OK
but on one condition
you surrender to me one last time
Sit down
you have to let me have my way
this will be fun you will see
it will be our farewell
you owe me that
Tcheky
i am going to paint you a nice clown's face
you know how much i love clowns
Lovely eyebrows
Lovely clown cheeks
Nice little lips
a nice yellow nose
and clown lips
does my little doll want sex one last time
Tcheky
why did not you ever say you loved me
Well because you never asked me to
there is a true clown answer
it is not right
Something's not quite right
my creation's missing something
what could it be
i know
he has no red nose
a comedian's nose
you have taken me for a hotel room clown for so long
after this it is over Tcheky
it is over
as a clown Tcheky are you scared of dying

if you want to settle this mon ami then let's do it
what started this
i thought it was dangerous for Gambit to spread unfounded rumors
it is not a rumor
i know someone who was there
the Genoshans they welcome mutants to their island
if the inhabitants of Genosha are encouraging mutants to live among them this is an opportunity we can not miss
Please Cyclops can i go
Please
Sure Jubilee i guess a beach can not be too dangerous

JUBlLEE EXCLAlMS IN PAlN
be quiet for once
the Leader has promised that you mutants will be released once this dam is built
but if you try to escape you will never leave Genosha
that is one of the Mutant Registration guys that grabbed me after the weirdness back home at the mall
i guess when the President canceled his program
he moved south for his health
we have to do something
Dispose of this one permanently
GAMBlT
you are making a mistake
you do not know what she can do
Gambit

Knowledge is power

Taking a walk
i have got a plan on how to get out of here
when they brought us back to the prison today we walked right past the goon who turns the collars on and off
if we jump him we can get the controls and get our powers back
you are going to end up like Storm in a box
Hey
no way
they won't expect us to try anything right outside the prison
we will take them by surprise
i will get you out so you can talk to the others
this girl i knew in the orphanage taught me how to pick locks
it is your plan
you tell them
they like you better anyway
now go on quick before the lights come on again
yeah
okay
Listen everybody
i know a way we can all escape
i have got a plan on how to rush the guards
do not be stupid kid

TRASK
the manufacturing process is entirely self contained
all it requires is an outside power source
HODGE
Too much power Dr Trask
you blacked out half of Genosha last night
we will have our own power grid once the dam is finished
then Mastermold's children will be able to track down mutants anywhere on the planet
Good to see you again Colonel
i am called Leader now Mr Gyrich
do not forget that
Cameron Hodge
Development adviser to the Government of Genosha
LEADER

you should have seen their faces when i showed them who had betrayed them
DOOR OPENlNG
he calls himself Gambit
GYRlCH

they call themselves the X Men
X Men

Maybe you can use it
CHUCKLES
GYRlCH
who is this man the one the Leader is so afraid of
HODGE
his name is Cable
an American apparently
he was a mercenary in the Leader's army until he found out the Leader was not the champion of democracy he claimed to be
we are not sure but we suspect he is a mutant
so he threw his wages back in the Leader's face and took to the hills to start a revolution
Cable lives by his code but he will not live long
i always thought it'd be great to have a sauna
Storm

EXCLAlMS IN ANGER i hate you
the collars you use to control your mutants
they were invented by a scientist in Scotland
a true genius
GYRlCH

how much is it worth to you
to have that man Cable eliminated
LEADER
how much can you pay
when the dam is completed we will have the power to create thousands of Sentinels
Your Sentinels make you a hard man to refuse

we deal with the Sentinels when all of Genosha is ours
Come on

do you love me or not
that is a dumb question
you are not alone

Caught you napping
what
is it love or what
you knock me out Ismael
you can read me like an open book
i will take back that question
no do not say anything please
yes i am napping undeniably proving i am in love
therefore you deduce i am in love with you and i resort to daydreams to avoid expressing it
i can not hear you clearly
Get to work
i want to go home
Julie yelled at you
Shut up
you scare me
Julie annoyed you
Julie asked questions
i know
she did not disagree when you moaned you were the world's worst fuck
i will cut your tongue out
it will make life easier
you will thank me later sweetie
you are not even circumcised
Why say that
you are a mini Jew in fact
Kiss my mini Jew yarmulke and get to work
Excuse me have you got a light
Your barrage of questions
on the wherefore and why
of my heart's reasons
Simply finds no reply
i can not deny
i have reasons to love you
i do not see why
the reasons why i love you
so the answer's no
is it your pretty bum
could it be fear of loneliness
Sheer luck or am i humdrum
or is it just laziness
i can not deny
so tell me now
i have reasons to love you
i do not see why
i should let you know
the reasons why you love me so
so the answer's no
my angel sweet
Wants me to sing praises at her feet
Gloria
my holy dove
Demands to hear my song of love
Hallelujah
is it your scent when you are near
the way you curl under the covers
Maybe it is even your sister dear
Your money or even worse
i can not deny
so tell me now
i have reasons to love you
one lost promise two careless words
Three pairs of panties Left on the floor
Your lips are sour Your smile sweet
Four pubes in the shower i am under your feet
Your mistakes
my professions
my curses
Your transgressions
and then
after you dream of before
everything fades it is an open book
Just tell me how we look
when we weigh up all we took
Just tell me how we look
Just tell me how we look
Five minutes flat not our best
Six pics if that of a sex or a breast
Seven calls from your mum every hour today
you should answer some she won't go away
I'd make it better
if i could
Too much hurt
for the good
when you add it all up
Love you love me how much
everything fades it is an open book
Just tell me how we look
when we weigh up all we took
Just tell me how we look
Just tell me how we look
Eight years of love one Thursday

Excuse me Ismael

Diane 35
Did i take it

yes
the pill makes me depressed

you are on it
i was but i have bought this thing it is like
it is like a coil
it replaces the pill see
Why are you on the pill
it is not the pill
Whatever
you do not sleep with guys
i will check anyway
what sex are you into
me
what sex
i am into non sex you know that
that is the sex i am into
Thanks a lot
you are different
you are like my sister
it is not really sex
this is sick
Why are people so against egoism
Egoism can be moral
that is really sick
you should be guiding me
we were supposed to sleep remember
i really think you are very pretty
i am not sure you really thinking that reassures me
you think you could
what
Tell me you love me a little
do you love me
are you in love with me
no i do not love you
you do not love me
of course i love you
Except that i
Screw you
that is pathetic
it is pitiful
by staying with you am i supporting something that sickens me
this soppiness
you started with your non sex
Non sex is not an open door to such idyilic romanticism
i am anything but romantic
you are anything but what you say
anything but a boss a Jew
Give me a break
i never laid claim to being Jewish
i can not even locate Tel Aviv on a map of Palestine
you start with mad joy
Concentrate
Tranquillity
Surprise
and
that is not surprise
what is it
what is it Julie
Help us
no idea
Amazement
Sorrow
Sorrow far from moderate
Despondency Dad
yes despondency
Fear
more than fear
Dread
no watch
Terror
not terror
what then
it is horror
Well done Jasmine
Despair
in other words i take him from joy to despair
Thanks a lot
Ismael annoys you a little
yeah he annoys me a lot
have you seen Cedric again
i suppose you could say that
he is married
he will never leave her
i know that
Maybe when his kid changes schools in two years
Unless the idiot repeats a year
what is going on Julie
we are involved in a dumb scene and Ismael's useless
so what else is new
he is forcing me to break up for him
you are leaving him
not break up with him
we have started this threesome and the third person's taking root
who is it
it is a girl
Alice
was that Ismael's idea
no it was mine
i am into threesomes
Jeanne let me help Julie
to do what
Let me okay
you are needed in there
Go and sit down
no arguing
do not let dad drink too much
what is going on
it is really complicated
a threesome with Ismael
Why did not you tell me
i do not know
i did not need to i guess
how long have you been three
a few weeks
a month
a month
i do not want to pry
so do not pry
i am surprised in any case
so is this threesome over or not
Nearly
does this Alice have your key
Mum
you were spying
what is it like
Sorry i should not ask that
i do not mind
so what is it like
Weird okay
and it is hard to sleep
all three of you sleep together
and it is hard to sleep
yes Alice has nightmares
that can not be easy
and she is in the middle
we should not talk about this
i agree but we are talking about it
i am quite intrigued
Only natural Mum
i do not get it
this Alice is she for Ismael or for you
for both of us
both of you
not together
yes sometimes
but it is tricky
it takes effort
yes of course
i can believe that
Did it come naturally
what
the sex
yes the positions
i
Did you know where to put yourself naturally
that is the easy part
how do you decide
on what
Well do you talk about it first or
no not really
it just happens
it is not embarrassing
no not at all
i thought it'd be complicated
it is tricky enough for two as it is
had you done it with a girl before
me
no
do you like it
it is weird
it is
it is funny
it is different
but Alice likes it
i am not answering that
we have talked enough
yes
Thank you sweetheart
it is good to confide in your mum baby
the cake's going to burn
i want you to know i am still in love with Ismael
you do it to make him happy
Bring the cups
Ismael's doing his cushion thing
not so loud
he just dropped off
the jerk does it well
Let's go and see Jeanne now
Let's see Auntie Jeanne
do a little burp for Auntie Jeanne
Dirty bugger
are you crazy
i loved that cushion
i will get it
Cut the cake first
you will only say we cheated after
who is going to hide
for God's sake Dad
my little sweetie pie
who is this piece for
that is not very funny Dad
she doesn't want to
Come and give your dad a kiss
now close your eyes
who is this piece for
for Mum
Make room for me
Give your old father a cuddle
Move up a bit
there is no room
you too
Mum take a photo
not now
this is so embarrassing
i will get the cushion
Jealous
i thought Ismael worked Sundays
he still does
every other Sunday
Why are we doing the dishes
the washer's dead
i mean why are we cleaning up for the men
it pisses me off
we ate too Julie
Doesn't Dad ever do a thing
he is revising
that degree's a joke Mum
he will never sit the exams
i am not so sure
he will do it just to piss me off
the rain falls without a care
on the angel of the Bastille Square
the sky is so grey up there
as the rain's needles pierce the air
the rain falls without a care
the grey clouds heavy and solemn
Bring water for Paris so fair
for the naked angel on its column
nothing moves on the street
Outside the window pane
Paris seems draped in a sheet
Bathed in drops of rain
against the broken sky
the angel spreads its wings
I'd love you till goodbye
in this rain and all it brings
Shit
i will go
Rain falls again without a care
on the angel of the Bastille Square
a pot of tea that we share
in the camomile Sunday air
the rain pours down without a care
Who'd have thought a drop of rain
would make people flee the square
Leaving the angel to its disdain
nothing moves on the street
Outside the window pane
Paris seems draped in a sheet
Bathed in drops of rain
against the broken sky
the angel spreads its wings
I'd love you till goodbye
in this rain and all it brings
the rain still falls without a care
on the angel of the Bastille Square
an early night we both share
in sheets free of wear and tear
the rain falls without a care
over family meals we have to bear
the angel in the floodlight's glare
Spreads its wings on the Bastille Square
you bought a new ring
i gave it to her
that is a serious breach of contract
what contract
the gentleman's one
no rings for my wife
i am not your wife
i know what you are up to
you think i can not figure out your plan
you will eliminate me by beguiling me with your kisses
what do you mean
this is no three ring circus
with me as your horse
a real gift horse
with your heart
and your teeth
you are sure
Touching her means fucking me
you are sick
Send in the clowns
i do not want to go
we won't stay long
Slowly
Watch the cars
Look out
Thank you
i know your game
you think you have won
Your cake and the baker's dame
two for the price of one
little bitch that is so cheap
it makes a nasty sound
Your jealousy won't make me weep
after all you sleep around
i am the bridge between your banks
Running from side to side
Cross over and give me thanks
Kiss and let me be your guide
i love no one but you
i love no one but you
little shit you think you are so swell
i smelled your fingers swine
where did they get that odd smell
it is definitely not mine
little bitch go to hell
you are just as bad as me
in adultery you dwell
she touches you i see
i am the bridge between your banks
Running from side to side
Climb on top i will say thanks
Why not give me a ride
i love no one but you
little shit make your choice
we will be two no longer three
that is all over let's rejoice
Come on it is her or me
little bitch i will make my choice
you know better than all of us
Let's hear your pretty voice
in this circus
i am the bridge between your banks
Your quarrels leave me cold
Trample me and rub my flanks
i will stay here and grow old
i love no one but you
Paris is already so far away
Paris so petty and petit
we will be happy every day
Enveloped in the city
who cares anyway
if it is raining at JFK
i am scared during landing
but you hold my hand tight
Like a kid so understanding
i wept there in my plight
who cares anyway
as long as with you i stay
Crossing from the Brooklyn side
Touch my hands
my love so sweet and mild
i will be right back
was laughing happily wide eyed
Like a happy child
April brings Manhattan
Sunshine and blue skies
Like an eternity in satin
his name's Gwendal
i do not care
who cares anyway
i will get Julie
if the wind carries your scarf away
as Broadway turns on the heat
we are dancing on the rooftop
of 218 Adam Street
you are my Liza and i am your Bob
Excuse me
you are here
i do not feel good
i am going home
Stay if you want
are you crazy
Come on
Let's go home
Just a second
where did i put the damn stub
got it
you fetch it
i will go on up
we can not go out
Stay inside
that is my girlfriend
what is going on
Julie
Stand back
Good evening

Good evening
Good evening
Julie

were you here when it happened
a young woman 28 heart and respiratory arrest
GCS 3
i am fitting the scope
Hook up the drip
the sat rate is 95 for now
during the concert she felt faint she went to the bathroom
i joined her
i went to get our things
when i joined her outside she was lying on the ground
Did you consume alcohol
Did you use drugs
how long were you apart
i do not know
two minutes
would you mind waiting in the car please
Take her shoulders
Watch the gear
when you are ready
Head to foot
Shoulders ready
Prepare to lift
Lift
Prepare to lift
Lift
200 joules loaded
Step back
Watch out for the charge
Charge
no pulse
no pulse at all
she is in total AV block
no reaction at all
Forget the bicarb prep a shot of adrenalin
20 mg
Carry on ventilating
Keep her on manual
Still no pulse
one more charge
Prep another shot
i am the doctor
TN 10 10 Quebec Foxtrot
Delta Oscar Sierra for 59 rue du Chateau d'Eau
my final tune just began
my last song along this road
a single for a single man
my terror summed up in a code
Delta Oscar Sierra
the police code like a breath
Delta Oscar Sierra
the song of approaching death
it is Ismael
this song of mine's a real must
but you fall before it passes
it is all dust to dust
a mean little mound of ashes
Delta Oscar Sierra
the flashing of the ambulance
Delta Oscar Sierra
the song of death's dance
Your father says you are asleep
Your mother wants to touch your brow
the wood around you makes us weep
and tells us now that you are now
Delta Oscar Sierra
you dance against the walls
Delta Oscar Sierra
as death calls do you need help
Delta Oscar Sierra
the police code like a breath
where did i put it
my book
the song of approaching death
Delta Oscar Sierra
the flashing of the ambulance
the Night Stirs
many people have a soul that loves to swim
they are commonly known as lazy
Part two
the Absence
Ismael
okay
Going to my place
of course
Why did not you let me know
i left a hundred messages
i know but my phone is out of order
i am going to the paper
i have taken half a day off work
Let's do it now
i can not
Give me the keys
i will do it
the place is a mess
Put them in the mailbox
i won't snoop
of course you will
the sandwich in the fridge
do not throw it out
or eat it
first insert Sarkozy's son's scooter
Three suspects arrested
are you listening
Arrested has an r missing third line
DNA there is an extra space
last line after policeman add an exclamation mark
you are not the materialistic type are you
no
Clothes and stuff do not really matter to you
is this some twisted way to say i have no dress sense
no it is a ploy
you won't see stuff left at my place again
what have you done
nothing
Jeanne's gathering Julie's clothes for a bonfire
Shit what a bummer
i told you 20 times
you confiscated my key
but i spend all day there
could not you sort my stuff
i open a closet i break down
so sorting things
if only you could break down
Open the closets
Wide
Shut up
i can help you
you can help me too
Leave me be
i can see you are bothered but i do not love Gwendal yet
i do not love you either so calm down
but i need you
you are surprised
be quiet
you have said so much nothing surprises me now
we make
a silent promise a speechless vow
the words
in excess
we must
be quiet
our tongues are weary let them rest
to have
Tongue to tongue
a dialogue of the deaf
sometimes
Believe me
we must
be quiet
Keep your saliva as an antidote
Let it
Trickle like sweet venom down my throat
the words
in excess
we must
be quiet
our lips are dry and our mouths do not need
to get
Caught up in the words
of this play we read
sometimes
Believe me
we must
be quiet
at last
be quiet
in the end
it is my kid brother's
he is a clean guy
not with the dishes
for the remotes
you have cable TV and DVD
there are earphones if you want
for the PlayStation unplug the lead
Thanks
Good night
it is you then
what is
the draught
Sorry
it is not a problem
but since we haven't paid the gas bill we sleep with the window closed
you do not like my sleeping bag
it is fine but i can not sleep so i am not using it
yeah i know
i was told
Whatever you were told i can be alone
it is six o'clock
Usually i get up at seven
i will make us some coffee
Why get up so early
to go to school
Shit
the bastards
it is too early for their crap
my name's Erwann
Shit the bastards they are all Bretons
you said it
Shelves full of Anatole Le Braz crepes every Monday night and our motto
Treat a sailor well and he will shit in your hand
Very nice
is not it
Unfortunately the buds are out
a lot of maples are opening out
the Japanese roses are in flower
a frost will kill them
to avoid that go out to the garden and prune all these tiny branches
Morning TV is bad for your mental health
Use my room
it is the first on the left
the sheets are clean
Sleep well
Thanks
okay
my day's off to a good start
how do you experience things before 8 AM
it will be a glorious day
Done your English
no but i have read Aragon
Le Cri du butor
do not spoil it
it will be a glorious day
Unnatural weather Like a painterly sky
Weather strong as a woman
Weather to sell your soul
it will be a glorious day
Weather to laugh and run
Weather to stay alive to fear the worst
Stop it
for pity's sake stop
on the banks of the Seine Young people at midday
Michel with Madeleine Pierre with Jeanne and Germaine
who walks with Jean
if the sky is full of birds what do you care
the fire that burns in hell
where are you going the swallows ask
is April here at last
Paparazzi
you are the first guy to sleep in my bed
i am
i got you some some from the bakery
Croissants
not croissants raisin buns
they are better with tea
Tea

5 15 PM
no time to stop off at home

no there is no one here
i can lend you clean clothes

Very Breton
Give me a break

Good night
Good night Yvette
Good night Alice
you know Alice
Julie's parents have had the autopsy results
and
it was cardiac arrest
a small blood clot lodged itself in an artery
nothing caused it
it is like a cot death
Let's have a drink
i am tired
i want to go home
okay see you
if you can not sleep call me
you will
you promise
Stop freaking me out
hi
Shit are you crazy
you finish late
Why are you here
this is my neighbourhood too
Posters for Communist Workers
Exactly
what do you want
nothing
i just came to say hi
at three in the morning
if i am a pain i will go
you are not a pain but how did you find me
i do not really know
i am going
to your place
can i come
no
should i insist
Wait at your office tomorrow
i am sorry Erwann
no
you have no doubts
you do not need anyone
Did i ask you anything
okay i am splitting
Why are you here
i was worried
you did not come home last night
you are not my mother
you could have called
i left messages
you spoke to my parents
you heard about the autopsy
you slept here yesterday
yes
do not you have a home
i thought we could help each other
Support each other
Together
it is just as hard for me Ismael
you could make an effort
an effort how
Respect my sorrow
you respect me moving in here
it was my sister's place too
what is the dog doing here
i was scared here alone so Mum let me borrow her
got a light
you got the issue finished
Sorry i can not go on like this
i just can not
i am not interested
it doesn't help
have Julie's keys
i will take mine and say good night
no questions
Give me the door code
7 A20
Make yourself at home
you are working late young man
i am not working
what is a Breton library like
the Beautiful Room is Empty
this is not on the programme
Mad about Vincent
do not mix them up
Salinger though
have you ever loved
for the sheer sake of it
have you ever taken
a bite of the apple
for the taste of the fruit
Its sweetness and its zest
have you often lost your way
yes i have already loved
for the sheer sake of it
but the apple was hard
and i cracked a tooth
those unripe passions
those indigestible loves
often made me feel sick
but a true love that lasts
Leaves lovers exhausted
and their overripe kisses
Rot on our tongues
but fleeting love affairs
Know such futile fevers
and their kisses so green
Chafe against our lips
for if you wish to love
for the sheer sake of it
the worm in the apple
can slip between our teeth
it eats away at our heart
our brain and all the rest
Slowly bleeding us dry
but when we dare to love
for the sheer sake of it
this worm in the apple
that slips between our teeth
can make our heart fragrant
our brain too and leave us
Its perfume inside us
but fleeting love affairs
See such futile efforts
their passing caresses
can wear out our bodies
but a true love that lasts
Makes the lovers less fine
often the test of time
Gets the better of us
Time for bed you runt
it is only 4 AM it is not late
Tomorrow morning at 7 you have mathematics chemistry algebra
i can sleep in the lounge
Make yourself at home
okay
i took Scarlett to the Pepiniere Park yesterday
i hadn't been back since Julie died
it was our park
you took us there when we were kids
it is good you were able to go back there
i think so yes
Right
shall i make my salad
anyone for cheese
no thanks
i will have some salad
Help me make it
i am not doing it for one
Jasmine no hysterics
you are crazy
Ismael since we are all here
i want to tell you that Mireille and i want you to have Julie's money
there is not much on the current account but there are savings on two other accounts
i do not know if Julie told you but after she was hired permanently her salary included life insurance
we have asked for it to be paid to you
there
all in all it should amount to 20 000 euros
no thank you
i do not want the money
Sorry
no one wants the money
it should go to the guy who needs it
i did not pay for the funeral
it was not up to you to pay
Haven't you got any revision to do today
is this a new resolution to help your mum with the dishes
Xmas is over
you still have hope
has someone mentioned driving lessons in this family
and the old sister here
got anything to say
anything at all
a bit jealous is she
were you offered driving lessons at 20
Look at me when i speak
Look at me when i speak
Look at me
and give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
because i love you
i have loved you for ages
Disgusting
i am glad you are okay
it helps us all
my eyes gaze
at the sky
the white clouds against perfect blue
no sign of God
in the sky
Slow clouds in the broken blue
Sunlight floods
the sky
my winter days are spent forgetting you
and every second
is a fistful of soil
every minute
is like a sob
See how hard i fight
See how much i lose
in blood and tears
in blood and tears
i hurl up
at the sky
those pebbles that you painted green
but there is no reply
from the sky
no rebound on the sea's glassy sheen
Sunlight floods
the sky
my days in hell spent burying you
and every second
is a fistful of soil
every minute
is like a tomb
See how hard i fight
See how much i lose
in blood and tears
in blood and tears
i hope
that in the sky
Sly little devils the angels' wings will bend
so that you will fall
from the sky
to my arms Iike a gift a true godsend
but every second
is a fistful of soil
but every second
is a fistful of soil
every minute
is like a tomb
See how hard i fight
See how much i lose
in blood and tears
in blood and tears
Maud
can you give me a shot of vodka
with your lamb curry
Wake up
there is someone here
hi Ismael
it is past midday
it is okay
what are you doing
any coffee left
i am Julie's sister
Julie's sister
you are Alice
no
Work
what are you doing
i came to see you
where are you
behind you
do not you have classes revision essays
the best thing i can do is wait for you
that is kind
you are sweet
but i am like a huge mystery for you
you have no idea
what does that mean
it means you do not know me and should not wait for me
the mystery of your weary gaze
a mystery that keeps you in a haze
the secret of this daze
Secrets are my true craze
this barrier between you and me
this barrier who holds the key
Cross the border leave your daze
Stand on your land see my gaze
you need to advance
to cover the distance
Between you and me
you will have to be bold
if you want to hold
onto me
a chill grips your land these days
what to do in this winter maze
you are caught up an icy daze
Everything's frozen
Start a blaze
you need to advance
to cover the distance
Between you and me
you will have to be bold
if you want to hold
onto me
the mystery of your weary gaze
a mystery i try to appraise
the cheap mystery of your daze
Doesn't need your arms these days
Asshole
Gwendal sent his brother
what did he say
it is not about you
C'mon i am not stupid
he sends his brother to lecture me
he wants to move me
i dumped him
Badly
the guy's an emotional psychopath
Gwendal's great
he is already corrupted you
i swear the guy scares me
Gwendal
i do not want to see him again
Give the keys to his little brother
I'd been warned
Bretons are dangerous
Especially in love
here
no way
he will send Erwann back
Give them to him when you see him
what
nothing
what is up
they just changed the front page
New trainers
Like them
no they are ugly
Well well
i gave Ismael the keys
you can keep the stuff i left it is okay
Tell your brother sorry from me
Want a ride home
Want a ride home
i am okay
you are sure
See you
Part Three
the Return
Hey you
Tell me that you love me
Even if it is a lie
and we stand no chance
Life is so sad
Tell me that you love me
Good evening
i have to sit outside with the dog
it is so late
i waited till my husband dozed off
that is okay
i only just left work
you did not tell Ismael you were coming
Jeanne searched his things to get your number
something to drink
no i am okay
Thank you
Ismael told me about the autopsy results
Why did he tell you
is that important for him
i think so
it is important to understand
i am not so sure
we expect doctors to clear up every mystery to unearth the secrets that explain them
i reject that illusion
Mystery is part of life
and it merely adds to the horror of Julie's death
but that is not why i called
it may sound silly but I'd like you to take care of Ismael
I'd like you to watch over him
i am asking you that
i called because i heard you'd moved out
i am worried
he is all alone
he is not alone
i see him every day
and emotionally
Emotionally what
are you still together
that is a really weird question
i only wish him well
i believe you
but i do not think you can help people if they do not want that
what are you doing here
Dad sent me
he woke up
you weren't there so he woke me
i am only here
i told him you'd taken Scarlett out
i am sorry
Alice
Go on
Thank you so much for coming here
we are counting on you
you are one of the family
can i give you a kiss
Coming
i will give you ten minutes to yell at each other first
can i sit down
got a cigarette
my exams are stressing me out
Want to keep the pack
no i have to sleep
i must not smoke all night
do not take this badly okay
Look on it as kindness on my behalf
i do not thinkyou're one of the family
Thank you
i do not think you need to be one of the family to feel grief
okay
are you getting over it
no
Objectively i am not getting over it at all
and you
a little
i think so
i will be going
See you
Wash
my soiled memory in its muddy stream
with your tongue's tip lick me clean
and remove every single trace
of what has been
of what binds me
of what comes to pass
Alas
Stalk
Hunt her down for within me she fights
and when you have her in your sights
do not heed her pleas and cries
you know
that she has to die
this is her second demise
and so
Kill her
Again
Weep
i have done that before all in vain
more sobs just wet the pillows again
despite my tries
despite my tries
i have
a dried up heart
and swollen eyes
i have
a dried up heart
and swollen eyes
so burn
Burn when you sink into my bed of ice
it melts when you hug me like a vice
there is no more sorrow
no more gravity
if i have
Your body like a flow
of lava washing over me
my soiled memory in its muddy stream
Wash
Did Scarlett wake you
i have brought croissants
what is going on
i do not think i can offer you breakfast
Shit
can we talk
i do not have much to say
so let's walk
we are on a street
no one will criticize us
i am not criticizing you
that is not what i meant
we deal with grief the way we can
i am not judging you
but your way is a bit violent
you are judging me
i am trying to understand
Understand what
what went on between Julie and you
that is a challenge
a real challenge
Understand why you never wanted kids why you were in a threesome my sister's life before she died
and a boy in my bed explains everything is that it
you have the right handbook
you are lucky
she must have had reasons to be unhappy
i won't say anything
it is for the best right
no it is not for the best
no one stops you speaking
Far from it
People need to hear you
my parents especially
Talk to them
to say what
i do not know
what you feel
Give me a break
i already have parents of my own
you are so self centred
you are ungrateful selfish
Sure i am thoughtless i am idiotic
and i am a faggot on top of it
it is terrible
that is not what i said
do not make me look like a dumb bitch
the same winter sun
the same snapping twigs
Icy fingertips
Frost on the railings
the same smell of soil of earth gone to earth
it will all be there
it will all be there
Except for you
the Pepiniere Park at the week's end
one more hour one more hour if that
one more hour before nightfall
the same temperature
down to freezing point
Melancholy beasts
at the gates of the zoo
the same hurried parents their children wrapped up warm
it will all be there
it will all be there
Except for you
the Pepiniere Park at the week's end
one more hour one more hour if that
one more hour before nightfall
Even if i stay
and walk where we walked
Follow the same paths
at the same time of day
Even if i am the same Even if i am beautiful
it will all be there
it will all be there
Except for you
the Pepiniere Park at the week's end
one more hour one more hour if that
one more hour before nightfall
Night will fall
and then
nothing more
Good luck
hi you are back
Your brother sent you
Tell him to stop it is a real drag
i am looking for Ismael
Gwendal did not send you
no
he did not tell you we split up
no
but i noticed
he is seeing someone
yes
where is Ismael
he is got a nerve
no i do not know
but I'd like him to help with the layout
he is not answering his phone
i know
you are not worried
should i be
i like Bloc Party too
what is going on Erwann
i hoped he'd be here
Why do you want Ismael
i won't hurt him
i will go
i have a mock exam tomorrow
Bye
Tell me something
this may sound crazy but i just thought of it
are you and Ismael together
i hope so
See you
See you
the dirty devil
Why have you come so late
could not you cope
I'd decided not to wait
I'd given up hope
Why have you come so late
what brings you here
what bizarre twist of fate
what sudden desire or fear
Why have you come so late
did not your mother say dear
you should not arrive late
for an invitation sincere
without flowers fine
but it is only polite
to arrive on time
when time is tight
Why have you come so late
when it is all over and said
and your brand new date
Takes my place in your bed
Why have you come so late
you do not have an excuse
no story to relate
no way to make a truce
Why have you come so late
i can not try as i might
the tales you create
of a future bright
where for now it is not so late
my angel it is all so bizarre
if you could face your fate
You'd see how much older we are
BRlTTANY
Hey there kid all day long
i have sung an idiot's song
you kept us waiting
Crawling in the gutter's flow
from Montparnasse to Chateau d'Eau
are you okay
one drink after another God knows where
i am melancholy
Zubrowska Riesling and Piper
at a loss not knowing what to do
i have come back here to find you
i run to your arms to get off the streets
any noise i will kill you
the delight of your charms in your soft warm sheets
but alas instead of that
i thought i heard i love you
that is his problem true
i thought i heard i love you
that is his problem true
so what if you do believe
so what if i can not be naive
however lost i may be
None of that between you and me
you want a body that is okay a pair of arms why not
in my bed you can stay Getting the sheets in a knot
but if you want to have all that
you need to hear i love you
you need to hear i love you
i am old a widower and sectarian
a poor idiotic vulgarian
i am handsome young and Breton
i smell of rain the ocean and crepes with lemon
be quiet now you little jewel
Once again you are wrong you fool
i am precious if you save me see
okay but none of that between you and me
you want a body that is okay
to get off the streets
in my bed you can stay
in your soft warm sheets
but if you want to have all that
you need to hear
Love me less but love me a long time

it realised the mistake felt shy and shown you to me today
Like day breaks on a sea shore
it is fresh and exhilarating
i am very happy this moment
i am hit by the Tsunami of happiness
i know very little about you
Yet i like you so much
an urge to meet you spilled out like a lava from a volcano
the pain of past eased on seeing you today
her innocent mischief pulled me closer to her
i started floating in air leaving the ground
i have changed the 7 colours of rainbow into fresh love orange
Like a new born baby
you have blossomed freshly
in the air i breath now you have turned it cool
a new magic has took over me after seeing you today
how long i have been calling you Ram
Why do not you answer me

Chain smoker
he wanted to be a pilot but ended up doing sky diving
it seems that is real flying
then he wanted to be a photographer but ended up as wildlife photographer

Advice
how is it
Very good
do you like graffiti
Like
i love graffiti
what are you thinking
my future man
how many days you spent drawing this and how many litres of paint
how high it was painted
was it drawn by one or many painters
do you feel like that on seeing yourself
do you know how i feel
after long time i have drawn a human face
do not you like human faces
it lacks truth in it
Right
then why did you like my face
when i saw you for the first time the happiness in your eyes that innocence that freshness
it was true
Tension too
you like to love and i love to love
those who watch are dead
that is why i like you
but you said you will love for sometime only right
yes
after that
i will feel like breaking off
if you feel like that
Let's break up
Let's love happily till we break up
Did you find me for this game
are you sure we will break up
Won't you believe me
Come
do not know what he will show me next
how dare to bring your girl friend to me
she doesn't believe me when i said i will love for sometime only
i thought you will tell her so i brought her here
would anyone bring like this
i have brought right
what sort of love is yours
it need to be displayed in this museum
do you love him
you will fall in love with him
he will not leave you without making you do it you too can not get rid of him
that is the way he loves
it will be so good that you do not like anyone's love other than him
Even after he is gone you can not compare anyone with him
he will cite some reason and break away harshly
Janu i am jealous of you
because you have got his love
i pity you too
because you will end up like me some day
if you come here again i will kill you
what are you thinking
Why did you split with her
because i was in love with her for quite long time
would anyone split for long time love
Still can not believe it
Come i haven't split with any girl without a valid reason
Check
Girls mean
the girls i loved
Right from Meenakshi teacher as a kid to recent lover Madhu
is your number 1 0
Slowly
is your number 1 0
i thought i got myself a Ram but got hooked to a Krishna Puppy
Watch this cinema first later on that cinema
Did you do anything like this
but i am still a virgin
you look ultra modern but think like a mass hero
Why did you love so many girls
because i can not live without love
is not there any one as best in your long list of lovers
Why not
who is it
me
i am the best in my love stories
Why did you split up with the sixth girl
she wanted me to tell i love you every day
that is why i broke up with her
for i love you
oh God
i asked for lover not a problem
i could not sleep last night
Why
would anyone split with lover for asking to tell i love you
she wanted to live all life with just i love you
is not that the meaning of i love you
we can not impound a life time's love in just three words of i love you
that is why i do not believe the words i love you
where the hell did you find him Janu
what is this silly game
Silly
what are you thinking
that is me
shall we love
though we are two separate identities
but today i feel i am in you strangely
so much that i am searching for myself
do not know what will happen to me without you
i want your friendship
i swear
i will do anything to make you believe me
Once i fall for any girl no lass would dare lose me
i love very sincerely
Once you drown in my love it is not so easy to come out of it
you will give your life also
i am honest
i will tell truth only
i hate lies and liars
i am the lone good man
i am mad about romance
do not ponder say yes to me
O girl my heart never wears any mask
i will show my trueself
if you no my love will not give up it will fight to win
O maiden
Always ready to fight me
you are my world today my dear
Even if you search all planets
though heaven comes down on earth
you can not find a man like me anywhere
Even great Taj Mahal is just a poor hut compared to me
Hereafter my name will top the greatest lovers of this world
i got hooked to trouble unnecessarily saying i love you to him
you are the villain to yourself
how can she love you after hearing the truth from you
Buddy if you want girls to love you few lies SMS's cruel jokes and a flower
that is it
Drinking so early morning
Hang over peg buddy
Bloody
he too got angry
Won't she get angry if i drink
and for that we can not tell the truth also
so mixing this truth with false i am drinking it
i am happy and she too is happy
i can not tell lies like you
do you mean to say mine is not love
he is drinking thinking about you
yes i am drinking
Mixing it with this
Taste it
Forget it do not i know about you
i warned you to stay away from him
Did you listen to me
i should've listened to you
you are right
first time in my life i am hating a love story
Why are you so tensed

if you are clear about it then it is not a problem
how is it
when you hate him so much he can not flatter you
you will not fall for him anyway
he will not say i love you to you
you too can not say i love you to him
he is very dangerous Puppy
for safer side i will stay in home
Home is also not safer for you

Brother in law always wishes good for brother in law

Giving me a lawyer's card
Why are you advising your sister to take divorce

Holiday
Holiday in love
Useless lover
Did you ever excite me like this
Waste fellow
Your boy friend expresses his love in a fresh and unique way every day
what great ideas
his ideas are good but his ideology is very bad
what happened
how will it be if any man holds you like this
it will be great
Just like this he took me to moon and dropped me down from there
Dropped you
you called him a hero right
he is not a hero he is a villain who appears like hero
the first birthday after we have fallen in love
Let's rock tomorrow to make it most memorable birthday of your life
what happened
it is my birthday today
i would've wished after waking up anyway why did you wake me up for wishes
he waked me up with birthday wishes
Did he
he will wish
he said let's rock tomorrow
anyway he will break off by next birthday is he mad to rock this birthday
Why has my love story flopped miserably like this
Why won't it flop
we can not hear what he says we can not see what he shows we can not bear what he does totally nobody can love like him
he is like a cyclone
i do not know what is he up to for tomorrow i am scared Puppy
no need to fear when i am with you
i have a brilliant idea to save you
i think you will spoil the show by over acting
Give me your phone
he is coming here
he did not recognise us
we can not recognise ourselves in this get up
how can he
Right
how is my idea
Brilliant
Situation is under your control right
Totally under my control
though i was right before him he could not recognise me
i will go before him second time
this is what you call rat dancing after blinding the cat
the lucky man amongst us must be decided today
is this all for Janu's birthday
Useless man
Did you ever do anything like this for me
it seems it is all for me
Janu come
Look there
what
are you here for Janu
yes
are you here to wish for her birthday
how do you know
we know a lot more
we thought we entered your love story
Butjust came to know you'd trespassed into our love story
was it your names in those chits
you have opened a gift shop
everything for Janu
do not act smart we have come to a decision
Today is Janu's birthday one amongst us would propose to her
Janu was playing game for us and you barged into the arena
now we will play the game for Janu you pick up the lucky chit
Playing chit game with chits
it is new
Let's play
he is selecting one of three himself let's go
Take it now
you have decided to play the game how can you play without my name
what is he doing
it is not fair to write my name and pick up the lucky one so
here is his nasty idea
Why is he calling them
could you pick up three chits
Why is he asking to pick three
it must be one right
Why three
after picking the three name in the remaining chit is Janu's lover
See it yourself
second round
what is going on there
no i do not want to do this
you are seeing life from one angle only i will show you from another angle
Look down
Life is just for once
Why do you spend it in fear
Think over it
i am also thinking about that only
i have only one life why should i sacrifice it for you
how is my surprize
how is it
has love on you came after you said yes O my love
if you say no now it won't die down O my dear
how your image got into my eyes like a dream
i will not keep quiet till i see you in reality
this is my heart that is my love
the wetness in my heart is engulfing you like a tidal wave 24 carat lovely love
i am showering it on you 24x7
though you scold or chide me
i am dying for you every moment of my life
Like the colourful rainbow vanishes easily
my heart is pure white which will never vanish
it is been waiting for you since eons and blooming for you only
it says it loves you
what would you lose if you say yes to it
i am having a beautiful dream
i am with you in it
Eternal bliss
i am saying it is all yours
it is a feeling only a heart can feel
Read it with your heart if you want to
my love is perennial like river Ganges
it is a lively rhythm of life
Impound it in your heart
with your every rejection my love for you is increasing
i am scared i may see life from another angle Puppy
i heard so many love stories and i could understand them easily but i can not understand your love story
would i fall for him if i continue like this
if you get this doubt i am sure you will fall
there is only one man who can save you from this situation
who is it
Your daddy
my daddy
what do you think of yourself
is that the gift you give her on birthday
yes i did
it all happened because of you
what happened
i had to sacrifice my 1 2 year old love
Sacrificed your 1 2 year old love
for whom
for Janu
for Janu
Janu's marriage has been fixed
Tomorrow is the engagement
is Janu getting married
it all happened because of you
you say love and she is ready to marry another man
Leave her
do you want me also to sacrifice
i can not believe you are getting engaged so suddenly
Your dad saved the day for you
i have seen the groom he is dashing
yes your romantic life will start now Janu
Your friends
yes brother
Why did you come here
i need to talk to Janu
Impossible
she is getting engaged
Why so suddenly
Did you fix this engagement getting scared of me
Why would we be scared of you
i can see it you are scared Janu may fall in love with me
that is your imagination
i will talk to Janu for a couple of minutes
Love is life time bond in my family
though you do not about that Janu knows it very well
Notjust couple of minutes talk to her for hours
nothing will change call Janu
so you are getting married
have you accepted this proposal for your father
Marrying getting scared of me
no
then
who decided this for you
myself
can you decide also
how did you decide
Using chits
who is the groom
Handsome
Marry him i will not stop you
but answer all my questions and then marry him
Why are you marrying him now
how did you decide on him
what is the guaranty that he will love all your life
Answer me
i do not need to answer you
i am not asking you to tell me
i am asking if you have answers for these questions
if you have Ram will not be in Janu's life
if you do not nobody can take me away from your life
Go call for you
Poor man would've sacrificed love like me
Sacrifice
that too him
i do not think you have understood about him
do not ever try to know about him
you will not be there for you also
no need of hours just 2 minutes were enough
you carry on
Go uncle auspicious time is elapsing
Go go
Why are you marrying him now
how did you decide on him
what is the guaranty that he will love all your life
i am asking if you have answers for these questions
i do not want this marriage daddy
Till now you ditched lovers have you started ruining their marriages too
you will not love her or allow her to marry in life
are you a human
Janu has taken a good decision for the first time in life
Let's encourage her
for that
Let's go to her home
no way
Stop stop
Please leave us
what is he man
how are you
Your face is clear
who is it dear
Shekhar come quickly
i am here to talk to Janu for two minutes
you ruined her marriage and dared to come to my home
Why are you talking to him brother
Hey get out
Go
Uncle cool uncle
i did not break the engagement uncle
Your daughter
i know who is responsible for breaking the engagement
you get out
i will talk to him daddy
Leave it on me
i broke the engagement it doesn't mean i love you yes i was playing game with chits
i must thank you for one thing because i did not knew till then who i want and what sort of a man i want
i have come to know of it because of you
i want a man who loves me all my life and i am sure it is not you
all three of us like you you have to select one of us
i will tell my decision before Valentine's day
are you busy
i will wait here
Neither he loves nor allows us to love
he is like that only
we will take care of him
Why are you disturbing her
i love her
you love her
Janu must also love you right
anyway Janu has struck your name from the game but still what makes you so confident
if you are confident she will love you won't i have it
but she has told us about taking a decision on Valentine's Day
do you need to take such decisons
my life and i will take decisions
everything is okay but you wanted some one who loves you all your life that is how will you decide it
how will you find it
Finding a man like is difficult but finding a sincere lover is easy
i can find him
Difficult
i can find
i said it is difficult
i know what i want i can find him
who is he
where is he
okay it is not me
is it any one of those three
how about that pink shirt guy
is it that blue shirt guy
that white shirt guy
that red shirt guy with cap
who
is it him this guy
who is it
if you have so many choices in campus think of choices in this city country and this world how many choices you have Janu
how will you find the right man for you among those billions
one man can not you find one man from so many
i must find him
if not i have to accept what he said
what was she and what you have made her
never give an opportunity for girls to think
See what has happened
i am sure she would've deleted your name from her phone
you too delete her name
who are you calling
Janu
what is your confidence
he has started it again
do not you have any other work
if outgoing call is free try another number
she has told you about her decision clearly can not you hear it
did not get it
i understood her well but what she said was meaningless
Tell her it was a stupid decision
what did he say Puppy
it seems your decision is stupid
will it become stupid if he says so
he never lies
what do you think of yourself
Am i stupid
is my decision foolish
any doubt
Am i stupid if i reject you
Forget about accepting or rejecting me you said you wanted a man who will love you all your life right
yes
that is why i said stupid
i have taken a strong decision
that is why i said stupid
Remember one thing there is no man who will love all the life
that is how a man who doesn't have trust on love would feel
i trust love more than you Janu
Listen to me love is good for sometime only
you will be confused first and later would be clear
Till then my love is yours
Till now he said he would love for sometime only is he saying love is good for sometime only
does he think he is Einstein of love
Mad man mad man
is 1 2 year a short period
it seems a jaundiced man sees everything yellow
that is the way he behaves
Did he ask you all this
do not we still love each other
Love is wonder
Love must be eternal right
he is trying to confuse you unnecessarily
we made a big mistake of leaving him initially brother
we must not spare him
i think this game was found for you only
to play without moving much
did not expect me here right
you are very lucky that is why you are here now
i am not one to fear for a scare uncle
in golf you hit the ball from behind in cricket i love hitting the ball coming on to me
what ever it is face to face
i love Janu very much
Love her so much
if you hit 25 runs your daughter wants to hit a century that is where a small fight is on between us when i say love's life is very short let's love for sometime only she is confused
i am just making some headway in moving her uncle once she is clear i am sure she will love me
what do you say uncle
anyway is not it too early for fights
after Janu starts loving me let's sit and talk leisurely
Bye
that is why i hate dads and uncles
i am an enigma to them
they need a lot of time to understand me
i am not a playboy i honestly and truely love Janu
to tell you clearly
Very difficult with you
Why are not you calling her even once
what if she selects anyone else
what wil be your position
she must do it only then he will get some sense
do you think will there be anyone like that
that is why i warn you not to call me when he is here
i am going
Maya sit down
Even if there is one he will be one in millions
i did not see one have you seen anyone like that Maya
if Janu finds anyone like that she will bring him to me
do not disturb me on phone
Blabber what ever you feel like but do not ever bother about me
Janu is here
she appears happy
has she found anyone
i will be happy if she finds anyone
Come
have you found your dream man
you are confident that i will fail to find a man right
i am not here to tell you that i did not find such a man
i am here to tell you that these so much love that i can not find everyone loves other wonderfully
i will find the man i want among them
when
before Valentine's day
there is no time limit for it my life i will decide when i want to
i am damn sure you will not find such a man
you have nine love failures behind you to think like that
but i have many successful stories to say confidently i can find
all are really love failure stories
are they failures
what are you saying
do you know who much my parents love each other even today
my uncle aunt my friend Sony have said they are happy in love
they are lying
Lie
is love a lie
is my love a lie
how dare he says our love is lie
that is why i hate him
he is crack do not worry about him
how dare
my brother was right
you still smoke cigarettes right
he is not just a villain to you but villain to all of us
Why are you here with a gang
it seems you said our love is fake
i did not mean you i said it generally
are not we part of it
we have only one love how can we accept if you say it is fake
we are here to settle it
Let's settle it nothing to worry
Give the bottle
Let's play a game
when the bottle stops one facing the bottle top must select truth or dare
it means truth or dare
Truth means you can ask me anything or i can ask you anything
but you must tell only truth
Truth means only truth
can not avoid it
one who can not can select dare
it means do anything what others ask
we have the dare to face the truth
Truth is like lion
Getting into forest to see it or playing this game is same
it stopped towards me
it seems you said love is good for sometime only
that is true
Love will be very good initially later it becomes journey in traffic won't you believe it
Ask Sathya
Maya no need to play these lousy games let's go
Your turn now
if two beautiful girls come to you now one girls says she wants love another girl wants sex what would you select
what would you do with her then
what if you are asked the same question
i will say i am already in love
what lousy answer you waste fellow
i said love right
all three of you love Janu
if Janu selects anyone on you three who will sacrifice for her
all three
it means you will give up Janu
Why do you love him
how do you know it
he told me while proposing
will you love anyone who promises you that
has anyone ever told lies in love
Why are you asking the question before spinning the bottle
this question for the person who faces this bottle
i am asking you again
has anyone ever told lies in love
me again
no pass or fail face it
Quit
so it means you have lied to me
i have told you little lies to keep you happy
will you lie to keep me happy
so you were lying to me all these days
have you ever told your lover he or she is dirty
those who were talking hours on phone feel like cutting the call now
what do boys think about girls when they are alone
i am telling you love is true but only for short period
what would you say
does anyone here want to break up the relationship
this game is very ricky let's stop it
Loving 9 girls is not great you got rid of 9 girls that is really great
Tell me one good idea to get rid of my girl friend
Tell her the truth
that is very difficult
what is your girl friend's name
he is asking me an idea to get rid of you
the speed with which she is coming it is one day trouble only hold on
from tomorrow it is happy all the way
Go
Come waste fellow were you with me under duress
shall we play a game
my love is of high range
it has never tasted defeat
it goes on saying truth or dare at times
this is force of heart it is a honey bee that drinks love
that is why all want my heart
Love which is growing tall like Mt Everest
one must be daring to reach the pinnacle
for love that is like McKenna's gold one must comb the desert
Love is not seen in the sweet nothings
Hearts that hide truth can never love
i will fall in love thousand times
i have so many feelings
i will write new history there is life in my love
i will make my dreams come true
i dare to speak truth only
if you look into my heart i have courage to give you shivers
O my love do not leave me
Come to my way
do not fall for youth that cheats showing you day dreams
Desire for the heart that truely loves you
if love showers dew do not kill it with your fire of hatred
if love wants to shake hands with you do not break the back of it
if love presents you nectar do not add to with poison
if love is a beautiful song do not gag it is voice
Say yes to love
you take chances
all lovers together can not take on me
there is no guaranty with promise of love for each other all the life
we came here bunking college why are you troubling here also
do not get upset with these liars
i am not upset
Look how people love each other
they are marrying happily
Look at Sony
i still have hope
they are in love for 1 00 days now
we came to wish them
there is nothing as you say
then you must wish me also
Why
my love is also 1 00 days old
what
yes i saw you the day he proposed to her
i did not see you after that
i searched entire Sydney
i met you again while playing that chit game
you should not have seen me at all
i heard a lot about you
it seems you will say only truth
i too heard a lot about you it seems you will ooze love with just SMS's
Why are you sending with him
nothing will happen
will you always tell truth only
when will you invite for your wedding
Let me finish my studies
shall we light it
do we need to go to Lanka to burn it
is it okay to you here
Life must be wild but i like portraits
he went that side and sent a message immediately
i sent the message to her
what happened
i am dead
no right message but sent to wrong person
may be his sister
not his sister looks like she will become my sister
Please manage the situation
i thought you love her are you managing her
you can play with lies but never with truths
he is forwarding the messages to her also
i will
Ram is also there
Go and face the truth
do not do it before him
what Swapna
who is she
Give me your phone
what happened Sony
who is Swapna
what are you talking
Give me your phone
Looks like a small misunderstanding
Right if this Miss and that Miss have little understanding all three can settle down
you too had 9 girl friends
i never loved two at a time
can not you stop their fight
Look people use the moment to fall in love
likewise there is a moment of breaking nobody uses it
Tell your friend to use it
Leave me
Why are you pulling me
Get lost
i will never see your face in my life
would there be such people in world
that is true
what is true
you say love is good for short while only
is it that
you are right again
that is it
you are a mad man
Girls will never trust this
how am i to tell you
how are we going so smoothly in this pitch darkness
because of car headlights
if we travel watching as far as this headlight shows us our journey will be happy and pleasant
my love too is just the same
what do you call life long love then
i will show you
Why are you going so fast
Why are you driving so fast
my love is like trusting my headlights
life long love is like trusting the other car's headlights
Make your choice
Why are they moon walking
he would've shown something to them
what happened to them
i gave them a practical lesson on philosophy
Lesson on philosophy
you mean
Difficult to tell
i will show you
Show me
Stay away from him please
you will be finished
Why are you afraid
he too is in the car
Hop in
Nobody can reform you
Let's go
will you get down Puppy
Open the door
i told you his philosophy will be heavy and not light
did not go to bed yet dear
what are you thinking
i am thinking about what i really want
what do you want
i want a love like yours mom
do you and dad still love each other right mom
everyone can not tell truth like him
it is true we loved each other once that doesn't mean we do not love each other now he thinks he still loves
Why are you still living together though you know this mom
Love is the reason for two hearts to live together
later children become the reason do not think too much go to sleep
you are super boss
i was fighting for freedom for 2 years i got it at last because of you
Waste fellow
Still have hope
can see it
Look
is it like Valentine's day
you have put an end card to every love story in the campus
me
what did i do
i will put an end card to your love story watch it
Let's decide it today once for all
you said you will decide today
me too
Janu please say something
i need time
you liked me first what happened now
we liked each other right
you said you will decide on Valentine's day
do not rush
is there any rule that she must tell today only
Once she is clear she will tell her decision
do not confuse again
she will decide today
you will say you like me right
you promised to decide on Valentine's day
Say something Janu
Look what had happened
you pushed her to wall what happened to your decision
it all happened because of you
you
how do we look like to you
do we look like mad people
what do you think of yourself
do i look like a joker for following you
who gave phone number first
you or me
who called first
you or me
Tell me
are we so cheap for following like dogs
Tell me i am asking you
you put your hand on me it is okay
Take your hands off her
should i take my hands off her
do you need this
there is no one in Janu's heart including myself
Look she roams with many boys he has many love stories
he is supporting her
Good very good
she doesn't know how a lover should love her
Wait a minute what is your confusion
i do not get you what is wrong in what she has asked
she asked for a life long love
can not you do it
i can not
Why
i can not do it
Why i say
because i do not believe in life long love
you do not believe in it
Tell me why you do not believe it
how am i to tell you
okay
i will tell you from here
after finishing student exchange program in Hyderabad

should she have to send SMS hundred times every day
it is very nice how do you do it
we do it sir
you can shade this little darker
yes sir i can
Keep this
first time i felt i was being pulled behind
how happy i am walking with you like this
but i was afraid
i was worried about spoiling this happiness
first time i deleted Mallika's message
the first thing i hid and the first lie i ever told
what are you doing
i am studying
okay study
Tell me
Why are you so serious
i said it for fun i was thinking about you only
if a lie can make her happy who wants the truth
little things but was forced to lie about it
what is the problem
i did not know
first time i felt those three words were meaningless
College got over so early
Your regular order
i will get it
Give me your phone
i will play games
what is that girl's name
Lilly or Malli
is not she in touch with you
Infact i do not even know where is she
it is been many days since i met her
how long have you been deleting her messages
how long have you been checking my messages
she is my best friend
what is in it other than hi and hello
hi boy
do not i know you love your friends
Roopa please try to understand me
they are good guys
they are my childhood friends
i do not like your friends
Come
he is calling us
Why are you crying for this silly thing
is lying silly thing to you
i did not know why i was lying to her
i thought my love won't be like others
i did not expect to go like this
how could i decide she will be the love of my life
is love wonderful
who said that
that doesn't mean we weren't happy
we were every time we lied
but what so ever it may i understood i will try to love her sincerely
but i do not know how long it will last
i have told my parents and got their approval
Why are you startled
Surprized how i got their apporval
i told them you love me so much
and that you will do anything for me no father would say no
he has invited you tomorrow
how nice it would be to stay like all our lives
would my entire life be like this only
Roopa has told me lot about you
have coffee
she said you both love each other so we could not say no
Come dear stand near him
are not a fine looking couple
you will be happy like all your life right
what should i tell now
one more lie
i am asking you
you will be happy like all your life right
i do not know
what do you do not know
Why did you say like that
my father is asking if you really love me
what am i to tell him
i do not know
do not you know
i do not know
i do not know
i do not know how many lies i have to tell to live happily with you all the life
my habits my friends my hobbies
i do not know what other things i have to sacrifice
i do not know who my life will be in future
do you atleast know it
you hold my hand and walk with me
do you feel anything here
you ask me to look into your eyes can you see little love in it
i will go on repeat i love you too entire day it is not coming from heart did i love you for this
Did i love to live like this
what is the problem
Get lost man
Bothering me
it is hell if two people live together without love
we can not stick on together
it is worse than hell to live thinking that this is love which is non existent
i can not do it
if i do not tell you this one truth now
i may end up acting love on you for entire life because i loved you once
i can not do it
then leave me alone
Go
i really felt free after saying go
the longer your love the intensity of it decreases
you are right
we have one life only
we must not spend it in lies
what the hell are you saying
i thought you will say he wrong but you are actually supporting him
we are living together for 25 years we are very happy
nothing has happened as he says
first tell him to stop talking about us
would anyone love such a honest man
Ask him
how can a girl love if you say you will love for sometime only
Did we split up without she loving me
Did she love you though knowing you will love for sometime only
how is it possible
did not finish it
i will finish it
Started it yesterday only
i wanted a man who will love all my life
but did not know how he will love me
now i know it
i want a man who loves truely like you
Am i hearing right
you are not saying this for saving you right
you did not save me now
then
you saved me long back
when i played the chit game innocently to select boy friend you joined the game and saved me you told me the truth to love for short time when i wanted love for all life and saved me again
i agreed to marry getting angry on you you made me refuse the marriage in the last moment you saved me there once again you made me realise that as love grows longer lies join the life you saved me there again you kept on saving me
i did not get it first
i did not do anything to save you
i was just trying to be truthful to my love
i am so happy for understanding me
Let's forget this world and love
Love truely
Love so much
you want that right
yes Ram i want this true love all my life
Ask me love i will give as much as you want
but do not put a condition of period for my love
because love will not be the same all the life
Even if i say it do not believe it
Love is not two hearts but two brains both think differently
i love cricket and you love golf i love graffiti you do not like it what i love in you today i may not like it in future
i do not want us to live a life of lies cheating each other
you shattered everything in which i had faith
do not shatter this one too
what do you want me to do without shattering it
if i say love will be same as of today all the life that will be my first lie
i had to break away from so many because i had to lie to them if i have to start a new love with lie then i do not want such love
Life long love is impossible
i too wish it to happen
i am not ready to take chances with false belief
you must be ready to split if it is not there
i can never split with you
Listen to me once
Again the same problem
what is your problem anyway
my problem
Love is my problem
you loved 1 0 girls did not misbehave with anyone
did not lie to anyone
did not cheat anyone
i think it is you who got cheated
is it your problem not to love many girls
no
Your real problem is not to love one girl all your life right
yes
then you will never get an answer for it in your life
you loved so many you loved them wonderfully what is there with you now
Except the reasons for breaking with them
you have ten reasons now do you have atleast one love
do not spend life with reasons
what is there with you now
Except the reasons for breaking with them
do not spend life with reasons
if love is splendid initially it is end must be more wonderful
if you want to see love as vast as sea you can see it at the fag end of life
if you want to see it you need to love only one girl
i want you
you mean you love me
for short time only right
no
Life long
i do not know
but i will surely try to love life long
that means you will lie right
would i lie
you said that
that life long love will force you to tell lies
that our brains think differently
i am still saying i will never tell lies
you want life long love right
i am telling you am i not
should i love accepting it
how to believe you
i have crossed the stage of trusting you
what do you want really
Hope
Give me hope of life long love
when i trust that hope i can love him
you want me to prove now that my love is life long
can anyone prove it
can prove with lies
if not no chance
what is our friend's condition now
it is time to start telling lies
you look at me mischievously you take over me
how am i to stop you
you are laying a net in the last moment
how am i to endure with you
O love
it is beautiful the day it begins like a sweet dream
it teases you delightedly and then turns life miserable like this
how am i to find the way to life long love
how am i to convince you
what else you want me to do
what ever i may do is waste
i am asking you
what should i do
what
what are you looking at
do you want me to frame it
Bloody spoon
when i come to you is it fair to change topic and cheat me
Why do i need love which can not accept me for what i am
do one needs a partner till death
you are teasing and handcuffing me and my soul
Tell me what exactly you want
will you play golf
does it look like a ball to you
this is my life Puppy
my life
Tell me where should i hit it
can you see the pole there
there is a hole under it hit it into that hole
Hit
no way
i won't play this game
you can play
i do not know how to prove it to her
i can not love seeing her face
what did you say
what did he say
i said i can not love seeing your face
a little bit of sweet a little bit of sadness
a little of bit of romance a little bit of disaster
if you carry on like this love for you will vanish
what are you doing Ram
i am trying to love
i can not try anymore
i can not take it anymore
what is it sister
Breaking off
that is what i did till now brother in law
if breaking up is the solution to the problem just a little time there are courts laws laywers and people like me to break relationships
but if love is the solution to the same problem there is no one to tell you how to do it brother in law
we must find it ourselves
Brother in law always wishes good for brother in law
if you think no love is the reason for this break up you must find it brother in law
i am also trying to find it
what do you want
you can not give me what i want
i am asking you what is it
what do you want me to do now
i want love as vast as sea
who doesn't want it
i too want love as vast as sea
but how
i can not get it with truth and it won't stay with lies
what do you want to do
i do not know how to love
i am telling you openly what i do not know
is it wrong
what do you want me to do
you better know it and tell me
Hands off
i told you hands off her can not you get it
Why did you take anger on them that you have for the girl
Why did you come here brother
i will take care of it
Enough of what had happened you have already done enough damage when i hear the questions she asks i am afraid of her future life
i know Janu loves you that is why i am asking you just tell me you will live with her all the life
i will arrange your marriage if it is not possible never again show up in her life
if you dare come again i do not know what will be the consequences
Think and take a firm decision and tell me right now here
Why are you still thinking
Go and tell her
what should i tell her
you always said people use the moment to fall in love
likewise there will be a moment of break which no one uses it
Buddy a time will come where you have to lie to save a relationship
this is it
Tell you will love her life long so that she believes you
if not you will lose her permanently go
Go
Tell
Tell
what should i tell
Even now what i said is right
i can not love you all my life
my foot
Look what he is saying
Why should i change
i am like this
how was she
when her friend's love got confirmed
she said like that
how lovely she was then
is it the same face
while playing that chit game she childishly asked to pick a chit
how cute she was then
now look at her face
she said Ram i saw a lion
how excited she was then
is it the same face
she said i did not apply make up i am natural beauty
how innocent she was then
now irritation fight for every trivial thing and anger too
Forget about love i feel like slapping
Come on slap me
Slap me
you were always smiling
where is that smile
you said till then my love is all yours where is that love
it will not be there why would it there
are you the same Janu now
but my love must be same always
it won't be
Am i a statue
if that is it why are you thinking about it
you need a reason to break away from a girl right
there are so many reasons leave me alone
i can not do that
Why
i feel i will spend my life with reasons
what will you do then
i will love little more
if that gets over
Again i will love little more
what if it gets over
Damn fate will make me lose that also
i will try to love little more
what if that also gets over
what happened after that
what happened after that
what will happen after that
what happened after that
what will happen
what else would happen
we do not understand a word he says my brother told her to leave him many times do you know what was her reply for it
she said she wants only him
when asked why only him she says he knows to love and she can not find any other man who can love her life long
we agreed for it
Did you see the result
it seems they agreed what happened after that
Loving a girl is easy if we do not like her it is much easier to break up but loving the same girl a little more is hell you know that
what is this
Job in school
Dad knows the school well
Stop these graffiti and these useless paintings
should i stop all this
are these useless paintings to you
can not even buy coffee or tea
what is this for
this is for me for my pleasure
this is for me decide now
me or graffiti
she wants me to give up graffiti is she mad
Why should i give it up
do not give it up
who is asking you to give it up
Just tell her you have given it up
that is all
Till now you wrote graffiti by Ram write as Sam from tomorrow
Look at me she asked me to quit smoking but i am still smoking she asked me to quit drinking i am carrying a bottle with me that is it
Love means few lies few SMS's cruel jokes and a flower
Learn how to maintian a relationship successfully
that is it so simple
i was coming getting your call he wanted to solve his problem i have solved it
shall we go now
it is grave sin to act love for the girl you love
Hereafter you will know who difficult it is to tell truth
that is why though difficult i will tell only truth
Let's go
Brother
it is grave sin to act love for the people we once loved
it is not his fault
i can not find a better man than him who will love my daughter truely
Living together or breaking up it is their will and wish
will you stop it
Why should i
i have learnt it from quite young age i will not quit
i can understand one thing now sir
i feel the thought that i love a girl is itself a big lie
because i feel i love myself more than her
the reason for me not to love a girl is myself
i Ram is the reason
Life should not be spent with reasons
all i have only one thing with me to sacrifice for her that is my ego
Hereafter there is no graffiti in my life
i am going sir
Drop me in my home
Home
i too want to love a little
you
what is your program now
Get her to say i love you again
Give me a good idea
how about a gift
Lots of gifts are despised
Suggest something better
how about a flower
all of them give it
i never gave her one
Long back i gave one to my teacher as a little boy
i never gave it again to any girl
what flower she likes most
can i take one please
i know
Good
with short stories of love a life long love story
not only your ideas your ideology is also good
Why all this
to see a sea boss
Chapatti
no rice rice
Trust me Maya i am telling truth i do not even drink coke now
i do not feel like missing Janu
Love is still pleasant to me
for one side lovers like you love is always beautiful all the life
but think little practically is not it right what he says
no Puppy
Why did you bring me here
you gave flowers okay
you joined the job okay
no need to quit graffiti for my sake
what is your idea
do not i know about you boys
you will publicize about sacrificing so many things for me
all the girls are like this you tell everyone about sacrificing so many things for us get going
nothing like that
i will not take it from others
are you any less
you made big show of loving little more
i got it
you want me to love little more right
Come
yes must give the card
Card
Say i love you every day
do not i have any other work
i will spend all the day sending you love notes
Love me little morethey have seen you now

Sterilize that for me
Sterilize

i remember now
last night
there was some punk and i could see all the wrong he'd ever done and i turned it all against him
the Penance Stare
it sears the souls of the wicked
it is the Ghost Rider's greatest weapon
all the Riders have it
have there been others with my Ghost Rider problem
been a few
last one was 1 50 years ago in a little town called San Venganza
Nice town
Nice people
Till a stranger came along making promises one deal at a time
Consumed by greed they turned on one another until the village of San Venganza drowned in its own blood their souls trapped forever in that godforsaken place
what is this have to do with Blackheart
Blackheart
he sent you after Blackheart
and others
the Hidden
Fallen angels cast out of heaven by Saint Michael himself
they hide within the elements waiting for the end of days

they can not come onto hallowed ground
Thanks
and thanks for the info
i feel much better now that i know i am the devil's bounty hunter
where you going
Somebody i gotta see
that is a bad idea
would not be my first
Why'd you do it
Why'd you make the deal
i was a kid
What'd you get in return
Heartache
Captain
Captain
Forensics on the bikers and the station manager suggest the same cause of death
Sulfur poison
i did not think sulfur was toxic
it is in massive doses
and these guys were swimming in it
could be the work of a chemical attack
or a religious nut
Hey
i know you
i have seen
okay

Sulfur

Ever read the Old Testament
Brimstone

i got over it and i went to college i got a great job
but you Johnny you are just the same
oh better paid more fans but you are still just a carny
yeah
oh man
my dad was right
you were just a phase
that went well
Hey captain

End of days
the host can gain control of the possessing spirit through concentration on and manipulation of the fire element that exists within man
i am speaking to the fire element within me
Give me control over the possessing spirit
hi
hi
Hey i hope you do not mind
Your lift was open
i came to apologize
i am leaving town tonight and i did not want what i said today to be the last words between us

Bill he just got it
i still have that one
you what
i have that one too
i remember that day
there were a dozen people waiting in line and you went through a whole roll of quarters
Look at my face
you can tell i was just terrified that my dad was gonna come in any second
okay i just
it is just i think i should walk you to your car
See it is not great timing
you almost kill yourself on the highway so you can ask me out and then you do not show
then you keep my picture but when i kiss you you try to shove me out the door
what is
what is going on
do not you care about me at all Johnny
you know you can talk to me
you can tell me anything
Please
you would not believe me anyway
Try me
you will think i am crazy
Maybe i am crazy
i hope i am crazy
in my job i have seen and heard just about everything
so there is nothing you can tell me that is gonna surprise me
off the record
yeah
i sold my soul to the devil
and now i have to spare you
Spare me from what
the devil on account of i work for him
that is why i could not make it to dinner
because you were working for the devil
Well yeah
i am his bounty hunter
but it only happens at night like it is right now
Whenever i am around evil
Evil people evil spirits
i change into
what
Just a great big monster but i am learning to
i am getting control of it
i am trying to
so tonight you will
i believe so
which is why it is probably a very good idea that you run on home now Roxie
you are serious
so this is your excuse
for the past
for last night
for everything
the way i see it is i have got a couple of choices
i could either accept that you really believe what you are telling me is true and take you to the nearest psychiatric hospital
you see now that
or i realize that you'd rather make up ridiculous stories than be honest with me and i walk out of that door forever
do not move
Hands up
Hands where we can see them
Right over your head
Johnny Blaze
yeah
Captain Jack Dolan
this is Officer Edwards
you are coming with us
okay
Let's try this again
we have your plate and the tread from your tires at the crime scene
we have a witness who will testify that the suspect used some kind of fire effect
an effect just like the ones that you use in your stunt shows
yeah
but i told you i did not kill anybody
what about him you remember him
no
this guy was three years from retirement never harmed a fly
in fact neither did most of the corpses turning up since you came home you son of a bitch
i did not kill anybody
Bullshit
okay let's take a breather
it is warm in here
Warm
yeah i am burning up
are not you
a little
you want a cigarette
okay
Mind if i do
okay that was weird
Look Johnny i am not asking for your help
i am asking you to help yourself
i watch a lot of TV and i know what you are doing
Good cop bad cop
but you are both good cops
and you provide a very very important civil service
in fact when i finish my stunt career i intend to apply my skills to being a motorcycle policeman
so I'd love to help you
but i did not kill anybody
Jesus Christ
who you trying to convince Johnny
us or yourself
we are trying to help you here
we are trying to keep this thing quiet
yeah because i imagine that your fans would not be too keen on you being wrapped up in a homicide investigation
not to mention all those corporate sponsors event promoters
you ready to talk now Johnny
or do you want to spend the night in the tank
oh i do not wanna do that
no sir
i sure do not wanna do that
but i did not kill anybody
Damn it

Looks like somebody's tripping out

Looks like trouble just found you
Nice jacket

Innocent
Forgive me Father for i have sinned
i have sinned a lot
Hold it
where is the contract of San Venganza
i do not know what you are talking about
do not lie to me
you have been protecting it all these years sworn to secrecy
Sworn to keep it from the likes of you
there is an old saying
Raise no more devils than you can lay down
my father raised one too many
Calling all units
Reported 10 50 in the downtown area
Proceed with caution
he is coming for us
Abigor

People help me
Go go go
Surround him
Make a perimeter
Let's go
Come in please
Come here

you are pissing me off
okay okay
Sorry
Take a right
you should've joined us Rider
Soon we will have the contract and then you will only be a footnote in the history of the new hell
Time to clear the air

oh my God
Johnny
Prepare to fire
Fire

anything good on
how can i help you captain
Get out
we brought a friend of yours in for questioning last night and now he seems to have disappeared
has Johnny Blaze tried to contact you in any way ma'am
Sorry
can not help guys
Look i do not pretend to know what the hell that thing is but i do know that Blaze is wrapped up in it
and the only way you can save him now is if you help us find him
you got six hours
after that we go public with everything we got
Six hours
Carter Slade
Legend has it he was a Texas Ranger
Man of honor
but he got greedy
Found himself locked up waiting on the gallows
Stranger came to see him
Offering freedom
Slade made a deal
Ended up a Ghost Rider
what is he gotta do with this
Remember that contract the stranger made with the people of San Venganza
the story goes that Slade was sent there to collect all the souls
but what he found there was so evil that he took the contract and rode off
he stole it
Keep Mephistopheles from getting his hands on it
some people say he was buried with it
was he
i do not know
what i do know is that Blackheart is coming and he will do anything to get it
that is why it is important for you to stay away from friends and family anybody he can use against you because he will
Roxanne
Johnny
Johnny
God
Sorry
Sorry
Ma'am you gave me a start
i am looking for Johnny
yeah
you and me both
have you heard from him
no
but i heard he got in trouble
he got arrested yeah
what for
yeah well if this gets out in the press his career is over
yeah trust me his career's the least of it
you know you seem like a nice lady and you are pretty and all but we were riding the gravy train on biscuit wheels then you showed up everything went to hell
so why do not you go back to wherever it is you came from
i can not go back
not now
then tell me what the hell's going on
you would not believe me if i told you
Look you do not know me but i love him
so if there is anything you know that can help anything
Lately he is been reading these really weird books and they are messing with his mind
he is writing stuff down and staying up late
and he does it over here
you can go through this stuff and i do not know if it means anything
this is hallowed ground
Did you think i was like the others
i have all of my father's strengths and none of his weaknesses
the new hell is in San Venganza
i need the contract
i know it is here
now give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
you are gonna fall
Just like your father
the Rider where is he
Gone
the girl
you hurt her he will be there like lightning before the storm
i am counting on it
where is Roxanne
Dude
where have you been
Everybody's out looking
where is she
she is out looking for you
Jesus
not even close
you have his heart
now i am gonna break it
Roxanne
Mack
Roxanne
Look into my eyes
Your Penance Stare doesn't work on me
i have no soul to burn
i guess the Caretaker forgot to mention that huh
Surprise
he sent you to bring me back
i am not going back
i like it here
he thinks you are better than me
i do not know who is more pathetic you or him
now listen to me
and try to get it through that thick skull of yours
you do not work for my father anymore
you work for me
Get the contract from the Caretaker
Bring it to me in San Venganza and maybe i will spare your girl's life
and Johnny
do not make me wait
what happened
Blackheart
they got her
where is the contract
i can not end this without it
Just gonna have to dig this whole damn place up myself
it is not there kid
Contract of San Venganza
Hell on earth
now you are gonna have to trust me
and why is that
he may have my soul but he doesn't have my spirit
any man who is got the guts to sell his soul for love got the power to change the world
you did not do it for greed
you did it for the right reason
Maybe that puts God on your side
to him that makes you dangerous
Makes you unpredictable
that is the best thing you can be right now
San Venganza's 500 miles from here
we better get moving
we
i got one last ride left in me
Carter Slade
can you keep up
Let's ride
Stick to the shadows
this is the end of the trail for me
i got nothing left
i could only change one more time and i was saving it for this
God knows i have made my share of mistakes
been trying to make things right ever since
Guess all i can do now is hope he sees fit to give me a second chance
Thank you
no
Thank you kid
the Rider is coming
Coming to save you
you think you can stop him
nothing can stop him
he is running out of time
i will make sure of it
it is almost dawn
Slow him down
what
Slow him down
Surprise
Stop
you change she dies
do it Johnny
Let her go first
Looks like you are out of time
this is the contract of San Venganza
all of you come to me
Johnny
my name is Legion for we are many
Let's go
he got what he wanted
you go
i gotta get him to the shadows
i gotta end this
Why
Why you
it is been me since the day i made the deal
i am the only one who can walk in both worlds
i am Ghost Rider
Run
Come on you son of a bitch
all of your world all of your souls will be mine now
Throw me the gun
it is out
Throw it
how does it feel to have all that evil inside of you
all their power
all their souls
a thousand souls to burn
Look into my eyes
Your souls are stained by the blood of the innocent
no
Feel their pain
Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
Kill you
Stop it
oh God
Monster
i am not afraid
Congratulations Johnny
you upheld your end of the bargain
it is time i take back the power of the Ghost Rider
you get your life back
the love you have always wanted
you can start a family of your own
there are more deals to be made
more people willing to give their souls for what they desire
Let someone else carry this curse
you are free now
after all a deal's a deal
no
i am gonna own this curse and i am gonna use it against you
Whenever innocent blood is spilt it will be my father's blood and you will find me there
a spirit of vengeance fighting fire with fire
i will make you pay for this
you can not live in fear
no
so where will you go now
Wherever the road takes me i guess
my daddy once said lf you do not make a choice the choice makes you
yeah
but why do your choices always keep us apart
Sure wish things could have turned out different
no
this is what you are
this is what you always were meant to be
you got your second chance
Go out there and make the best of it
it is said that the West was built on legends and that legends are a way of understanding things greater than ourselves
Forces that shape our lives
Events that defy explanation
Individuals whose lives soar to the heavens or fall to the earth
this is how legends are bornoh a little help
Wow your hair is really thinning
Standing as proven to be healthier increases productivity and just looks cooler
Picture someone doing something heroic
now was he sitting or standing
not counting FDR
every second you sit there is an hour off your life
Look at all of you
i feel like you are in suicide cult
no no no
you are way off on that one
are you really comfortable standing there
i tried one of those and i just could not find the sweet spot
Hey guys let's just all admit it okay
Dwight's better than us
he had the guts to stop sitting and he is never ever gonna go back on it right
that is right Jim
Hey man
Hey
Taking a load off huh
no
Putting a load on more like
Good luck with that
last thing i need is luck
Thank you so much
what are you up to
oh look out
Just what are you doing
Too fast
Ha ha
Give that back
Come on
Prank
oh that is real creative
you know what you are right
it is not my best
' Cause you could easily just bend over and pick that up right
i could i just do not feel like a loser
because you are sitting
Standing
okay
do not
because you are sitting
Standing
you know i have to do this
i know
Whoaaa
Sync and corrections by n17t01 www addic7ed com
Andrew Baines Bernard
i think you can just do it with Andy Bernard
Andrew Baines Bernard
i love filling these out
' cause it is like oh i am taking a test but i know the answers
in four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door
i told her she could work here
Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen
there you are
Honey
how on earth did you miss the elevator
what was that
i do not know
he was not talking to me
but if i were you i would not hire his wife
that is why my foundation the Dream for a Wish Foundation is gonna put them out of business
they are not gonna know what hit'em
everyone
I'd like to introduce my wife Mrs Robert California
Mrs California this is everyone
hello
hi
Welcome
Call me Susan please
last night at dinner Susan and i were talking about her returning to work
so she is here today to see if there is a good fit
something tells me it just might work out
this is Andy Bernard the regional manager
hello
Nice to meet you
Hey there
it is a pleasure
Welcome
Thank you
Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office introduce her to various departments find a place where she will shine
i would love to but i have to be completely honest with you guys
we are 100 staffed up
Andy let's see if there is a good fit first then we will talk
all right  Knock knock knock knock knock knock 
you do not have to say it if you are doing it
Remember how you said that you were looking for a place in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics
uh weight lifting yeah
Well today's your lucky day
i have opened in this very office building
Dwight Schrute's gym for muscles
Wanna take a look
i will take a look
Your path from obesity begins right here
i have been meaning to join a gym for my health
i used to say i wanted to live long enough to see a black president
i never realized how easy that would be
so now i want to live long enough to see a really really gay president or a supermodel president
i want to see all the different kinds of presidents
Obese people in my office building are a drain on resources
Chairs wear out faster
it takes more freon to keep them cool
they flush the toilets more often
Plus their massive BMS bust the rivets on my pipes
but a gym turns fat into cash
all right the DM express is pulling out
all right well it is really nice to meet you Brian
uh it is actually Ryan
oh Ryan
yeah
Bitch
we will start here at Erinville
hi
Reception
you are classic one man operation
although i was watching a movie and Meryl Streep had two secretaries
i was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco
Just sayin'
two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients
Certainly worth exploring
would not you agree Andy
i will explore exploring it
Good
Seems like you have this under control so i will just duck out and run the company for a while
okay next stop on the tour sales
here we go
Station stop Jim Halpert
oh boy our resident truth teller
all right have at it
Let her rip
what do you hate about this place
Well it is sales so you have to be able to live in the world of rejection
Maybe you do
hi i am Dwight
Sales is really not so hard okay it is paper
we have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it
Jim
Well it is not that easy
it is kind of sometimes difficult
it is the second easiest job in the world
Being a mom
i love shopping
and sales is just the other side of that
that is true
you know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr Dwight Schrute
that is me
Dwight why do not you tell Susan about some of your hobbies
oh
Survival skills
Mm hmm
Ranking of animals
Maybe over a beer after she is closed her first sale
Well make that a red wine and i will tell you my animal rankings
how am i supposed to pull this off
the entire office is being nicer to her than they have ever been to me
what i would not give for one of Phyilis' classic room clearing farts right now
Ready
what do you think
huh
um no no
this is not a gym
this is like a scene out of Saw V
you haven't even looked around yet
Look
Gravel bucket squat yoke
Right
Dedicated phone book ripping station
you ever cut tin before
no
Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire
Plus i will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard
now let's go over membership
i am gonna need the first month's and the last month's up front for 49 a month
but every third month is 59 a month
but the fourth month is a discount month at 19 per month
Obviously you know how a gym works
so you know i am not gonna pay money for this
you want people to come to your gym
Make a real gym
Darryl
Make a real gym
i was thinking accounting might be a good fit because i really clicked with Oscar and i do have some experience with bookkeeping
but we already have a surplus of accountants as it is
i would work in customer service and um HR even
those are fully staffed as well
are you telling me that there is no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands
yes
i am the CEO and i am telling an employee of mine what to do
Let me beat around the bush for a second
our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings
Robert it is all right
this is very uncomfortable
Obviously there is no place for me here so thank you for trying
Why do not we just let it go
no
Absolutely not
Andrew there must be something you can do
there must be
Think
Well there are a lot of considerations
i would be eternally grateful
it is not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one
all right
Well then welcome aboard
so what happens next
we get you over to HR and then get you set up with accounting
Hang on
hello
Say hello grandma
hi gam gam
Hold one finger up to Susan
you will just be a second
you numbskull
you were given a very simple task
i could not have been more clear with you
now say are you taking your medicine
are you taking your med meds
Why can you not say exactly what i tell you
Undo this
Undo it
you did not say good bye to your grandmother
we promised we'd never say good bye
Attention
i am now accepting memberships for the Dwight Schrute gym for muscles
first 20 members can take advantage of our pay what you weigh promotion
all i need is another gym
as if i do not have enough drama
we have a gym at home
it is called the bedroom
who is spotting who
do not use the bike in the corner that is Bruce's
Jeremy says
Enough
Oscar enough
Kelly
i have these sneakers which are basically just like a gym for your feet so
that is okay
i know how to build a business
you gotta bet the black people to do it to get the white people to do it
then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it
one step at a time
Did you bring your passport with you
who walks around with their passport
Well i do
Always ready for adventure
have you had any
no
Hey guys
so Robert doesn't want his wife working here
so now that she is we have to drive her away
Andy if he did not want her working here then why did you hire her
Oscar it was a mistake
but one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her
how can we do that
she is simply wonderful
this is all pathetic
i am not asking i am ordering
how mean are we talking about
it would he great if she were gone by lunch
Erin you are up
Find her a place to work but not too comfortable
got it
i know exactly which stapler to give her
here you go
um do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there
because this seems a bit cramped and i do not have a computer
Well that is a sales desk
yeah
you need to be over here with us accountants
Just sit here and be quiet
and if you have a question just raise your hand
but i am gonna save you some time sweetie and give you the answer now
i do not Know
no i do not think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant
i think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself
i mean it knows what it is doing
that is Gerald
oh wow
so cute
oh that is so cute
Aw
he is so tiny
is he in a ladle
yeah he is in a ladle
that is adorable
how on earth
did you get him in a ladle
he did it himself
is that ladle stainless or
oh stainless
Williams Sonoma
Excuse me waiter there is a dog in my soup
it is not that kind of ladle
Very cute
Aw let me see
Ah just the battery on these things
i am sorry i have gotta recharge this
i get it
last time i had a job
i remember i hated the boss' wife
of course she was married to Robert
Your employees do not seem to be taking to me
Andy
Andy could you step in here please
we will fix this
what is going on
Please
Andrew my wife
has brought up an issue that requires your attention
so uh if you will excuse me i should step out get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night
Okey dokey artichokey
you hate it do not you
do you not want me here
Why would you say that
it is okay
i understand
i am not sure how i would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either
it is not that Exactly
but it is something
Let's just say that if you do not want to work here
i am totally prepared to respect that
Why would you not want me working here
i do not know
i think i understand what you are going through
my husband can be a very difficult man to read can not he
yes
the dude is an enigma
Mm hmm
so he is mixed up in this is not he
got it
what do you think you are doing
Getting my sweat on
i build you this temple to the human body and you are lifting what five pounds
i just did like 35 minutes on the treadmill
i was watching you
you want to know how long it really was
no
Eight minutes
Dude i am gonna be here all week right
Five days a week
i figure i will start slow
is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings
i want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym
i am gonna make you look like Lebron James
it is Lejon Brames
that is what i said
you know get it right
i know
Cameras
Ooh still here
Terrific
Andy and i had a great conversation
and i just want to let you know that i am not going to be working here
Well that is a shame
it just was one of those thi
is it
because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want
which is fine
where did this come from
Did Andy say that
no he did not
but i could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him
what is the struggle
he made a great call hired a great person
you sure about that
Absolutely
no games
no games
because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me
Enough of this
i mean real Enough
it is gotten way out of hand
Andrew this is my wife
Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us i thank you for
but it is not welcome right now
Just be honest
Andy
yes
Why do you keep looking at my husband
Andy just answer the question
no games
no games
okay
i mean it was kind of funny actually
Robert storms in and he says
in four seconds my wife's gonna be in here
i told her she could work here
Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen
you lying son of a bitch
Tell my wife you are lying
i am lying
i am a compulsive liar
that is not true is it
no it is not
i tell the truth most of the time and i was just telling the truth about your husband
Jim knows
he was there
this is preposterous
Robert
Let's get Jim in here
where is Jim
he just rolled out and crawled out
can you call security tell'em to keep an eye out for him
Time to settle this
oh wait wait wait
Hold on hold on
i just need to get through
Just real quick
Real quick open
okay
that is weird
Well he is gotta be around here somewhere
oh
Ow Ow Ow
Creed i was never here all right
okay
what about your friend
oh boy
this is my gym my rules
you do exactly as i say no questions asked
yeah i am gonna ask questions and i might not do what you say
first thing we are gonna stretch the pelvic bowl
Ready
Get down on the floor
okay i am not doing that
Really
Too embarrassing for you
huh
you wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym
like the Fonz
Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool
he stretched his pelvic bowl
i did not know Darryl joined
Looks that way
Nice pelvic bowl
Deep
hello Jim
no no
no no no
do not
Damn it tuna
so i think you know what we want to know
do i
yes
i know
i do
Jim i have had enough of your unhelpfulness
i really wish i could help
i am not really sure how i can
for God's sake did Robert tell you that he did not want me working here
that is the thing
See i did not want to get in the middle of this
Still do not
but here is something
i feel that maybe if we take a step back this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse
i think we have got ourselves an answer
no
that makes complete sense right
Thank you all for a wonderful day
Perfect
Jim
yes
Answer the question please
i do not know what you want me to tell you
to be really honest my wife works here
and i love it
she literally makes me work harder
she makes me smarter
she makes me remember why i am here
and between us she is on maternity leave right now and i would love to leave this room and see her face
i would love it
i do not know how this helps but it is just what i am thinking
all right
Thanks
yes
all right
uh
yeah
yep
Thank you
Andy
Hey Mrs California
Hey
uh i am sorry about the position you were put in today
you know honestly we all wanted you to work there
Except for him
Especially me
yes i thought we really hit it off
yeah
Well different circumstances
yeah
who knows
who knows
Maybe after all this settles down
Totally
it is a date
Hmm
you are nothing
you are so weak
you call yourself a man
huh
this doesn't help me
i do not respond to that kind of strategy
okay fine
Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again
Dwight come back and spot me
all right i will help you
but first you gotta tell me what your goal is
what do you want
to push this bar up
no
because if that was the case the bar would be up by now
what is your goal
Help me
what do you want
to look good for Val
Val Kilmore

Wow

Fighting a losing battle every day
but with almost a million dollars in debt
i feel like i have failed
what are we gonna do
These owners are in for the fight of their life
Stop going in my ear and let me work
the kitchen has no stock
we do not have mozzarella sticks
Teresa no burgers
the dining room has no supplies
we have no cups no menus
and everyone
i got a comment about every thing
is on edge
Guys
Guys
Back off
in one of the most emotional Kitchen Nightmares ever
we lost our way chef Ramsay pulls out all the stops
you cannot give up
but he may be forced to do the unthinkable
Close your business
Close it
Close it
 Kitchen Nightmares 4x02  Classic American Original Air Date on January 28 2011 Sync by elderman for www addic7ed com
West Babylon New York a close knit suburban community
located on Long Island an hour away from Manhattan
Best friends Colleen and Naomi started as waitresses at a small quaint restaurant called Classic American
then in the year 2000 they seized an opportunity and bought the business from their boss
what do you think
we ready to open in a couple of minutes
Classic American was like my home
i grew up here
i figured i knew everything there was to know about the restaurant
Why not
Everything's good
oh thank you
we knew the business
we knew the customers
and it was good
this would be the beginning of something great
Soon after buying the restaurant
Colleen made her son Kevin the head chef
Order
and her boyfriend Dom the unofficial manager
Give me two bags of raw shrimp
Thanks
i started hooking up with Colleen and then she said well i could use you at the restaurant
so she is using me
i enjoy my job at Classic American
' cause it is like a big family here
Big hugs Kev
Whoa
it was good in the beginning
first couple years the place was packed
you did not have to worry or wonder if you were gonna be busy
now you get maybe six or eight tables
it is scary
you have to ask yourself
what did i do wrong
so tonight sucked
every night sucks here
we run out of things on the menu all the time
we do not have clam strips today
Hey Dominick why do we run out of everything
how the do i know
we haven't been busy
Dom's job here at the restaurant is just to order the food which is never done
it is always kind of a problem
Dom i need some of that chicken
i hear you
you do not have to tell me eight times
you need cucumbers on the line
yeah no
yes
yes no which one is it
hello
Nobody leads this restaurant
you got a bunch of followers and no leaders
the problem with Colleen and Naomi is they are too easygoing
there is more of a friendly relationship with the workers rather than business
it is ridiculous
do you want to go out there or no
i do not know
you know the waitresses they are texting in between working
Somebody's got to put these kids in order
how many tables were there
not that many
Nobody's making money
we are not successful
and you are wondering how you are gonna keep the doors open
Home sweet home
i was forced to move back home
i live with my parents because i could not afford
i cry on the way to work on the way home from work
i cry about what we have become here
and what are we gonna do
it gets to a point where you just dread being here
it kills me
it really kills me
we can not afford to close
we need someone to show us the way
Hey
how are you sir
Dominick
i am the manager
how you doing
Very well thank you
Come on in
have a seat
my goodness
is this here the dining room
it is so small
this is it
Obviously not much to manage today
the place is empty
is it normally this quiet
on Saturdays yeah
Damn damn damn
now you look like you have been in this business for 30 years
i haven't
Six years
what were you doing before that
Laying brick
it is you and who
Colleen and Naomi
okay
they own the place
okay brilliant yeah
i am actually going out with Colleen
you are going out with Colleen
yeah
oh so you are going out with one of the owners
yeah
Ex customer
yeah
Right
can i meet the two owners
Dying to meet them
okay
be right out
Bring them out please
you know this is Colleen and Naomi's last resort
if Ramsay can not get this place on the map we might as well just lock the doors chef Gordon Ramsay Colleen and Naomi
Nice to meet you
Colleen nice to see you
Naomi nice to meet you darling
Help me get up to speed with Classic American
how did you get to own it first off
we worked for the previous owner
you were working as a chef before
no actually i was a waitress
Waitress
Wow
and what were you doing
i was a waitress
Incredible
and you bought it from the owner
yes
how much 240 000
Really
yeah
a quarter million dollars for this
Just the business not the property
how much was that
that was 440 000
Wow
so in for 700 grand so far
how long have you owned the restaurant for
Ten years
Straight up what do you think is the worst thing that is wrong with the restaurant
Problem number one would be what
what would you say
i do not think it is just one thing
i think it is a lot of things
Give me one
are you always normally this quiet
no i am not chef Ramsay makes me nervous because i am out of answers
Maybe my eyes are closed you know
Maybe the head's so stuffed that it is just not seeing what it needs to see
okay well listen
i am gonna have a good look at the menu taste the food and catch up later
okay
Enter as strangers leave as friends
Enter as a stranger start dating the owner
here you go sir
oh
hello
how are you today
Very well thank you
how are you
i am Ashleigh
Ashleigh
i will be your server
okay great
i am freaking out
Having chef Ramsay come is very nerve racking
i could throw up right now
so how long have you been here
Ten years
Ten years my God everyone's been here for a substantial length of time
Mm hmm
Why have you been so loyal
it is like a little family
Great
Wow
Huge menu
about 100 options there
yes
Help me out
you could do fried calamari
it is very good
is it
Mm hmm
it is one of my favorites
Let's go for the fried calamari over Caesar salad
okay
and then I'd be stupid not to have the bomb
the bomb burger
the bomb burger
does it look like that
uh yeah
you know what
i am a big lover of mac and cheese
do you have any mac and cheese
yes
yeah lovely
and that will be all
Brilliant
you got it
Thank you
Thank you
Order
you want to throw in a macaroni and cheese
1 50
Order up Ash
that is my mac and cheese
Thank you
that was very fast for mac and cheese my God
Probably pre made
Eh
it is a mouthful of goo
that is gross
uh oh
that doesn't even taste like it is been cooked here
we do not make the mac and cheese here
no it tastes like it
is that a big hit
no
the kids eat it
Really
yeah that is dreadful
Poor kids damn
You'd think a menu with Classic American you'd at least make your mac and cheese right
yeah
not good
Like i am really sorry
i do not really know what to say because i am not the one making the food i am just serving it
What'd he say
that it was gross
Let's just hope he doesn't run to the bathroom
here you go
oh
Fried calamari over Caesar salad
Let's taste
not good
the calamari's really soft and sort of chewy
Touch that
oh
uh i do not think i really should be touching food
yeah do not worry
it won't bite
yeah it is soft
is this fresh or is this frozen
' Cause it tastes frozen
yeah it is frozen
Dreadful
anyway definitely not for me
i am finished
Thank you
okay you are welcome
how we making out Ash
he said they were gross soft and chewy
what is soft and chewy
the calamari
it is not crispy
it was not a great feeling when he was sending back all the food you know it is what we do every day
we think we do a pretty good job
he wants the bomb next
everyone loves the bomb
it is one of our house specialties
he is definitely going to enjoy that one
the bomb burger
Wow
Nice toasted bun
where is the burger
Ah there she is
there is a burger
how is everything
Bad
does anyone season food in there
Season it
yeah salt pepper
we do not add anything to it
Wow
the meat's really chewy
that is chewy as hell
will you ask the chef to taste that
okay
Damn
Thank you
you are welcome
he said the burger's really chewy
he said try it
he is right
it is chewy
uh huh
that is weird
it says on the menu the way mom used to make
that has to be the biggest insult to every mother in America
it is embarrassing because those are our most popular dishes
i was really shocked
this is the kitchen here right
can i meet the chefs
Introduce me to the team
this is Kevin my son
how are you doing
how are you
Nice to meet you
Likewise
so you are the head chef
yes
and this is your
Son
Son
Right
on a scale of one to ten rate the food at the restaurant
Between six and seven
Six and seven
i would have said six
half it and take two away and you are on my mark
Personally i like the food
but what the do i know
i was a bricklayer
you know what i am saying
Let me tell you straight and honest okay
the menu's hideous in a dining room that is miserable
the food's depressing and you have got the audacity to call it Classic American
you can not even get a burger right
we eat the burgers here
most nights we are proud of our food
Seriously
yes
yeah
i am really sorry but your food
i am a little pissed off right now
i could not believe that he said that
you are a young chef standing by your mother
Totally respect that
but you are pulling it down
and to think that your rating was seven out of ten mate you have got issues
and as owners with a huge responsibility on your shoulders it is like you guys have disappeared
you are screwed
it is not that i do not try
and i have not given up
God
i tried to do my best
it is not that i do not care and it is not that we are trying to take shortcuts
but we have cut back on the payroll and she is got a baby and she can not be here and he is got a baby and i can not afford to pay him
and i need to pay my people
it is not a comfortable position to be in
i can see that but it doesn't stop you from trying
so who is on the payroll here
we do not we are not on payroll
so not even the owners are getting paid
we haven't gotten paid in over a year
i moved back home
i live with my parents
i knew you had your problems but i did not think it was gonna be that bad
the situation is actually worse than i thought it would be
i am gonna go for a walk
i got to do some thinking
and i will see you tonight
God it is depressing
his first impression was that we did not care
it made me realize we lost our way
Come on
Come here
Come here
Come on
Come on
he is right you know
do not feel bad
it is gotten to the point where this ain't no joke
there is a lot at stake
you need a fresh set of eyes
that is what you need
i am scared
do not worry about it
it will be all right
Maybe we are a lost cause
after a lunch in which Classic American dishes were more disgusting than classic chef Ramsay looks to observe how the restaurant functions in a dinner service
i will have the ultimate combo
Soup can i get the bisque
can i do sweet potato fries
Sure
Great
Thank you
what is your strength
i am not really sure
you are not really sure
i am good with the customers
Right
and yet you work behind the scenes
you do not in front of the customers
Wow
and what are you doing
are you running around
i am the busboy
you are the busboy
i do whatever they tell me
when Chef Ramsay said hi to me
i just looked up at him' cause i was scared
his hair's a little crazy
Even though it looks soft it is like whoosh
Order
so when the tickets come on where is your tab go
they were originally coming out here
this broke so now they handwrite the tickets
Really
we used to have a computer but somebody spilled coffee all over the register and burnt it out
we can not afford to fix it
Ashleigh what does this say
oh focaccia bread
Reuben cut me two focaccias
Ashleigh write the tickets better
so do the tickets take a lot longer to handwrite
Well if the writing is sloppy it tends to get a little confusing
how long's the printer been down
Six months maybe
oh
Order up
Even with handwritten tickets
Order up
Order up
Order up
Naomi and Kevin manage to push out the food at a rapid pace
Thank you
you are welcome
God the food goes out fast doesn't it
Pretty fast
Excuse me
this is not hot
Unfortunately the fast food is not exactly pleasing to many of the customers
Just kind of soggy
what is wrong with that
they said the shrimp is no good
what is that
Garlic white wine
Wow
no good
the food coming back used to upset me more
but it is happened so often that i just become numb to it
does anyone ever get bothered about all the food coming back
yes
yes
it just seems like everybody's taking it in stride
i got you
i am lost for words
i do not know what to do
you all right
i am taking it all in
Likewise
i know the feeling
Colleen hey listen i know you are stressed and you got a lot on your mind but take the reins and run your restaurant
what can i get for you
can i have spicy tender appetizer and burger
there is no more
Teresa no burgers
we are out
yeah
you are gonna have to 86'em
how can we 86 a burger
Sorry
with owner Colleen completely shutting down
i really need that chicken for table ten
you are gonna have to wait
a leaderless Classic American runs into problems
Table three wants meatloaf
we do not have meatloaf
after problems
we have no cup Jay
i need these cleaned immediately
after problems
Crazy
Leaving the customers unhappy
and the staff frustrated
Table 56 has been waiting 18 minutes for something to drink' cause i have no cup
i know Colleen's really stressed out but how could you run a business when you do not have enough silverware you do not have enough cups
can i have a cup
uh
there is none in there
there is none in there
you know who'd want to come to a restaurant like that that is so unorganized
i would not
i need soup cups
can you please wash'em out
there is nothing here
there is two in there right now
oh my God
no soup cups
like how do they expect me to serve
Hey guys
Guys guys
Wash dishes
i can not
i got to i can not do this tonight
i really can not
i can not
you got to go Work the line because i am losing my mind
it is two hours into dinner service the kitchen has run out of everything from burgers
Teresa no burgers
we are out
to coffee
is the coffee even good
no do not do that
and owner Colleen has just run out of patience
i can not
i got to i can not do this tonight
i really can not
what is the matter
i have been fighting a losing battle every day
you are standing there and you are not getting anywhere
and i just keep going and going and going
you understand
i do understand
i feel disappointed in myself
i feel like i have failed
and i have tried hard you know
at the end of the day
it is your family and it is your friends
and it is not malicious and nobody's out to hurt but i am frustrated and i am angry
and i am scared
i am really really scared
i feel i have more to lose than anybody else in this place
Excuse me
here is the honest truth
the standards have been accepted too low and in amongst those standards there is a big friendship
Friendship's got all to do with it
'cause there is no friends when that place is closed
they get their next job six months three months two weeks they move on
and you will spend the rest of your life reducing that Debt
you are right
you are absolutely right
i need this to stay
yeah but it is not gonna get better if you keep on doing the same thing
Right and i know that
you cannot give up
okay
Well
Let's go and finish the service yeah
i have never met a woman with as much on their shoulders as Colleen
and today's been a bad day but tomorrow i am gonna have to pick her up and get those standards up there and she is got to set an example
in his first 24 hours
Chef Ramsay realized that there are many problems at Classic American
and high on his priority list is fixing the lack of communication
there is an exercise this morning that i need everybody to be open to
i want to find out the problems you have with each other
i want each of you to write down two questions two issues
Ask anything you want
Open house
this is not gonna go well
People do not like to be confronted here
Thank you
okay
so on the questions
Colleen why do you always seem frustrated at the waitresses
here we go
because
when these customers walk through that door you are the first person that they see
and they are not getting service
if they are sitting there and you are texting on your phone they are paying customers
they deserve your attention not the person on the phone
Ashleigh Teresa you do not text in the middle of service when customers are waiting for stuff though do you
you text when customers are
Wow
Naomi why are you such a pushover
because they are my family
they are not though
Your family's at home and this is your business
and the difference is night and day
you have to change
i have to work on that
okay Dom
Why are we always running out of product
i do not close every night
at the end of the day everything's got to be stocked and written down what we need
but
i am right
you are not right
before you make an order okay you need to go through everything
who is not feeding you the right information
he doesn't wait for information
he just goes
i just got through telling you
i do not close every Night
you are always so defensive
i am not Defensive
we are not picking on you
you always got an answer
you always got to come back
that is right
i got a comment about every Thing because when i open my Mouth everybody shrugs their shoulders and gets a attitude
because you do it all the time
that is why
'Cause i see something wrong
'cause i see something wrong and i say something and she do not want to be bothered she is spent
You'd rather walk around pissed off
this is the problem
is it you
is it him
is it me
is it her
who
who
it is everybody
no

it do not take one person to run a business
you need a Team
you need a team but you need a chief
Exactly
and there ain't no Chief here
who signs the Checks you or us
okay
you are right
i was ready to kill somebody
you do not disrespect me like that
they gotta find a way to Piss me off
this ain't no Joke
These girls are in debt up to their heads
they gotta get it
we gotta stay in business
Colleen you and Naomi you need to lead this business

Coming up
Table three has been waiting a really long time
Back off
Colleen can not take the heat
Stop going in my Ear and let me work
Chef Ramsay can not take the food
Look at that
and the owners are faced with a frightening reality

Close it
that is next on Kitchen Nightmares
after an explosive
it is everybody
no
yeah it is everybody
Yet revealing
you need to lead this business
Staff meeting
Naomi
Come here
i need two seconds
Chef Ramsay knows he needs to help Colleen and Naomi take charge of their restaurant
i need to make sure this service starts to go the way we want it
and he begins by assigning the owners new roles for tonight's dinner service
i want you expediting and i want you working with these two
Boss in the kitchen and boss in the front of the house
i am very anxious right now
it was a long time ago since i spent a night in the dining room
you have got to show me quickly why you own this place and what it means to you
we are opening in half an hour yeah
Let's go
Time for some changes yes
Chef Ramsay has also added a special to tonight's menu
Fun sliders
Giving a modern spin to an American classic
they are sliders
Fun and bite size yeah
that is 1 000 miles away from the bomb burger
yeah

Ooh this is good
how is that
Perfect
Try and chew it before you swallow it yes
Easy

Your menus will be right out
i have no more menus
i really need menus for 15
you want to take an order on 11 so i can grab those menus
you have to wait for a menu
it is crazy
Why is it so slow

we only have how many
13
you can have a seat right here
Your menus will be right out
50 seats and 13 menus
Trust us to run out on number 13 right
i just wanted to hide
there was people standing at the door and i was under so much pressure
we did not have enough money to print any more menus so we had what we had
13 menus
you are kidding me
i told you it was hell here
yeah you are right
it is not far from hell
Naomi sit those customers down
we ran out of menus
I'd much rather they sit down with no menu than stand in the corridor staring at you
as soon as they are finished with those menus pass them on to the next table
Mm hmm
Thank you
here you go
after a slow start caused by the menu shortage
the trio as your meal
Orders are finally taken
i am gonna need two more sliders
many of which include
Chef Ramsay's sliders
which gets the evening off on a positive note
they said it was excellent
i need sliders mac and cheese and crab cake app
okay
uh Colleen
yes
Open up now start getting the team together
i am trying
i am trying
an hour into dinner service the kitchen
led by Colleen and her son Kevin are having a hard time keeping up with the orders
Table eight needs their food
they have been waiting so long
she knows everyone's waiting a long time okay
what do you want me to do
and the mood in the dining room is starting to turn
i can not even remember what i ordered
if they do not make it now then we will leave
the food will be out shortly
everything just snowballed
i was doing the best that i could do
Table three has been waiting a really long time
they are not waiting any longer than these people
These tables came in at 6 00
Back off please
you do not understand
i understand
Stop going in my Ear and let me work
all right all right all right
as Colleen begins to get a grip of the kitchen once again
that is for table one
Food slowly makes its way out to the diners
Blehh
but the customers are far from impressed
oh my God how gross is that
Send it back it is terrible
Send it back
they did not like the calamari
it was crazy
he would like less sauce
Definitely just want to bury your head in the sand
how much sauce do you normally put on that Kevin
about that much sauce usually
Take a bite of that
Tell me that is normal
yeah it is normal
Kevin if that is normal you are abnormal
two Caesar salads going to table 12
the mother and son team are finally pushing food out
where is that going
Hold on stop stop
but a disturbing dish catches Chef Ramsay's watchful eye
Look at that
Just touch it
Plate of vegetables
Fingers going right through it
this is the sorry state that we have got ourselves into
if we are gonna continue serving that close your Business
Close it
i would not serve that to my dog
Stop
i would not serve that to my dog
Tonight's dinner service has been plagued with problems
Stop going in my ear and let me work
Send it back
it is terrible
they did not like the calamari
but this last broccoli dish
Look at that
was the last straw for Chef Ramsay
if we are gonna continue serving that close your Business
Close it
Teresa could you deliver that for me
Stop
Stop
do not send anything else
Close it
we are closed
Yous are closed
can i get a waitress over here please
i am sorry we are not serving anymore
no
Tonight was terrible
Tonight was a Nightmare
i do not want to face Chef Ramsay
i do not want to face my employees
i just wanted everybody to go away because it was horrendous
okay
Tonight was ridiculous
instead of making progress we went backwards more than i ever thought was possible
Tonight i realized there is no way this restaurant can survive
Unless there is a dramatic change
Tomorrow from the minute you arrive there is gonna be change after change after change
Get ready for that
Agreed
Agreed
yes
Good night
we just lost our way
i am hoping Chef Ramsay can put us back on track
Chef Ramsay knows that this dysfunctional restaurant needs a massive overhaul in order for it to have any chance of surviving
so he goes to work immediately after the staff leaves working through the night to give Classic American a dramatic makeover
Right good morning
Good morning
Ready to see your new restaurant
i am ready to see the new restaurant

and it is nice to have tears of happiness instead of sadness
Naomi what do you think

we got rid of those horrendous tablecloths
now we have got some vibe some lightness some excitement
this place is gonna be so busy you won't have time to start handwriting tickets

i haven't felt this good in a long time
this is the fresh start we have been waiting for
there is more good news

Dom

Big deep breath
oh great
Dom save some for the staff will you please yeah
uh huh
okay dig in
oh jeez
it is so good
Mmm
Kev if you can cook all this like this we won't have a problem
the menu is cool
it is exciting
there is a lot of new stuff
it looked awesome and it tasted even better
Did you eat this
Gotta try the corndog here
i love the new menu
it was easy
it was fresh
it was a lot of new things
i am excited
i just bit my tongue
oh man
i just want to say something and i am gonna cry
i can not help it
the last couple days have been really rough
but we pulled through it
and i know
you have to lead by example
and somewhere along the line we got lost
and i just want to apologize for that and say you know
i have gotten a lot of clarity over the last couple days
and in order for anything to work you have to have a leader and you have to have a strong leader because if you do not have leadership you can not function
we are family but we have a business to run okay
so those two things need to be separated
and we will i promise you show you the leadership that you need to do your job
okay
it is the moment i have been waiting for
it is a new beginning for myself as an owner of a business first and foremost
i love everybody here
so from this point on we are good
okay
i never saw Colleen with that kind of energy
it was a shock
and it is a good feeling
i think i am done yelling at people
it is time for me to change too
Chef Ramsay handed this to us and it is on our shoulders to make this work
we are both gonna take the reins and we are gonna be in control of this place again
Coming up they may have all the right tools
Diners are standing in the dining room waiting to be sat down

THE SOWER
Behold a sower went forth to sow
and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up
some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth
but you should be on stage by now
are you all here
but where is our film director
Sorry
i am here
OK then let's start with the scene where the elevator gets stuck OK
Come on the elevator on stage please
Thank you
and the sound effect please
Thanks
what
what is happened
Worry not for all is going to be right
Your film will be a beauty like a summer scenery
but there is a crack in the machinery
and i have the feeling it means something important
the scenery the machinery
could i care less
i can see him
i can see God
God speaks to me
i can see and understand his will
OK stop
Listen Eszter
this elevator this is the inspiration behind all this
so this elevator is in your mind only
this is the film of your life
so I'd like to ask you for just a bit more empathy
Get it
so
a bit more empathy
OK
Let's see
i can see him
i can see God
God has spoken to me
i can see and understand his will
how could anyone see that
God's will
Forgettable ideas these are no doubt
the real question is how we will get out
Forgettable
by no means
one of us has heard the Word
Let's follow and aid her  it might help us
we shall succeed
we are bound to grow
so are you and Eszter doing well together
and even better
i saw her with the set manager not long ago
I'd have never thought they two have any common interests save the theatre
what
when
where
with the set manager
yep
i saw them at Castro they were chatting by a coffee
i was just loitering there pure chance
See Miln the thing is that the conversation they were having seemed rather deep
i will rather tell the tale in pictures
what
Hasten servants a camera on board
and let me hear the story unfold
Servants a camera on board
Servants a camera on board
a camera on board
it is all to no avail there is no sense in picturing the insubstantial
but i can see it
here all bright white
there the dark like night
Like hell
and this way and that way but only the way i say
all right
it was good
and step forth while you are saying this last sentence
OK
OK and this way and that way
is someone writing this but only the way i say
would someone just tell me which line we are at
Aha
that is the line
Aha
Aha aha
Aha
we should know what is on your mind
as for your plot we all are blind
you heard it bright white yet dark night
Impossible it may be but that is what she wants
and that is all right
i might be unable to explain it but i can see it all clear
and i will make it happen about that do not fear
Say what do you think about your part
do you think it is the real thing
i do
i think it is a great part and it fits me
Fits you
this role fits you
oh come on
this role of yours both our roles are just poor
no
this all sucks
and with this director
oh come on we will make it
we will make it sure but this play is still a catastrophe
this play with or without us is a pile of shit
Hush you hindrance shut your mouth
Take these elevators
they move up and down when they work  still they will get nowhere
Fantastic
a great idea of yours
Take the elevators of course
Take the elevators of course
it is redemption time  angels and souls
Great great wonderful

then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart

but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it
Yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended

the risks are too great
that one looks like an islet cell
which one
that one
it is all puffy and insulin producing
it looks like a cloud
it looks like an islet cell or maybe a buffalo
the second we stop pushing ourselves something terrible happens something we never see coming
i have no imagination Mer
Teddy sucked it out of me

i know but i just can not help it because i feel like i am this close to
Hey
Nice hustle
you know i think this is just more avoiding thinking about Zola
Did you hear something
no
i we have bugged Janet till she is sick of us and she doesn't really know anything so we just have to wait for the court to give us
a hearing date and we are just
Keeping the faith
Keeping the faith

Ooh

we have been
oh
i would've thought it was
Kudos for putting a team together at all this year what with all the upheaval over at Seattle Grace
yeah well we have got a lot of good players
Webber being ousted all that nasty business with the Alzheimer's trial being shut down
no wonder they put a trauma guy in charge
you must feel like you are just scrambling to stop the hemorrhaging over there
we got another half hour out here or so and then we are gonna be ready to kick your asses tomorrow
oh just a half hour
is that all you need
Hunt i gotta go

Lexie

oh is it a heterotopic transplant
no
but you said Great is it is it big
Well it will probably take you all morning
Mr Felker this is Dr Yang
and she will be performing your angioplasty
Nice to meet you
any first year can do this
i thought i was gonna be working on a heart
you are gonna be working on preventing Mr Felker from having a heart attack
i mean i thought i was gonna be working on a heart in the O R
Hey
is someone gonna roto rooter my veins out
Mm hmm
so i typed it up for you
uh fielding positions batting order it is all right here
you are a good administrative assistant
Thank you sir
that is not a compliment
i think being chief resident has set you back
I'd like to see you getting off the sidelines more
one two three
okay what do we have
Carl Shatler sanitation worker mid 30's
Fell off the back of a garbage truck then hit by a car backing out of a driveway
okay vitals are stable but he has multiple contusions scalp lac and obvious hand injuries
okay Carl
Carl i am Dr Hunt
do you know where you are
can you hear me
G C S 10 and pupils are equal and reactive
i am gonna need the portable X ray and ultrasound
Right away
oh this hand's hamburger
he is gonna lose some of this
oh god
no
Calm down
no
Calm down
Kepner where is that ultrasound
Give us some room here Torres
okay i just need to stabilize the hand
and then i will
i said give us some room
the hand is not the priority right now
Fine
Page me when you need me
Mm hmm
Hey Karev i need you to sign these
what is it
a a subpoena for Zola's medical records
they are transferring her care to Seattle Pres
Wait
Why
we are her doctors
Well it is a conflict of interest because her prospective parents work here
that is genius
first they take her away from Shepherd and Grey now they want to take her away from her doctors
Wait wait the file
you have to sign
do not worry
i got this
Let's see
the patient just flew in from San Francisco
she has a hypothalamic hamartoma
what do you know
H H tumors are slow growing noncancerous
they sit in the hypothalamus
Ms Bayer can i help you
no it is best if i just hold her
it is okay sweetheart
how long has she been seizing
Well this is the fourth one today
Ah
it is getting worse so please tell me you can help her
it is uh it is tricky
Charissa's tumor is eccentric
it off to one side more than the other
Protocol is a subfrontal approach from here but I'd never get it all
Well the surgeon in San Francisco said that even if you just got a little bit of it the symptoms would not be as bad
for now um until it grows back
Well we will take any relief that we can get
i know the risks and i have done my research
and you you were successful on 87 of your surgeries last year
so we want the surgery and we want you to do it
I'd like to try something else
Excuse me
I'd like to come in from here from above
i think I'd have a much better visualization and i think i could get it all
but none of the eight other neurosurgeons we talked to even suggested that
Well that is because it is never been done before
Well what are the risks
uh well you are passing between two hemispheres so there is a greater risk of injury including short term memory loss um stroke and even death
no
i can not do that
i understand
i really do
a subfrontal approach is a very standard procedure
you could probably find another surgeon who is qualified to do that
can i see the list of who you talked to
uh yes but
I'd rather have you
Dr Samuelson is fantastic
i do not think you could do better than him
it was very nice meeting you Ms Bayer and i wish you the best of luck
so why did i just have an irate mother claim that you refuse to save the life of her teenage daughter
it was a consult for an H H tumor
i told her that with a transcallosal approach
i think i could get it all
she did not want to take the risk
it is a free country
so do it the old fashioned way
there are plenty of surgeons in San Francisco as qualified as i am to do that
but they want you
they got on a plane
i won't do it
it will grow back
Maybe it won't
Maybe
Maybe we should just wait and see and hope for the best
yes
no
i am not gonna do that anymore
i had a kid in a crib in my bedroom for a while and social services took her away
and the only thing they are gonna say to me now is that you gotta wait and see and hope for the best
it is frustrating
i get that
i am sick of half measures
not in my O R
not today
i can not
i think you can
i think her best shot is in your hands and so does that mother
we do not send people home Derek
it is not who we are
it is not who you are
you are right
do not send her back
so then you will do it
no
i am gonna prove to her my way will work
so basically what you are saying is the device that you put in him is defective
i am saying you you got one of the original devices and there are some kinks to work out
so it is a collectible
when i die you should just put it on eBay
for now the only issue is that you have to resume daily testing
because he could become diabetic again
is that right
because the device is basically a huge failure
no it is it is got some problems
which she is trying to fix
that is why they call it a trial
Hey the good news is we figured out what was wrong
and we are trying hard to figure out how to fix it
Look i i knew the risks when they put this tiddlywink in me
Plus all the checkups mean i get to see you more
do not worry
you will figure it out
okay Mr Felker
i am going to insert the catheter now
i will guide it up to the arteries surrounding your heart
Get ready to see a lot of cheeseburgers and fries
i work in fast food
oh
so is this all you do every day suck crap out of clogged veins
Arteries
they are called arteries
i am more of a renaissance type guy
i am a manager but i have to know how to work the fry machine man the grill make shakes
Hell when everyone else is busy
i am even the guy who mops out the john
okay we are giving you a little more sedation now
i guess everyone else is busy huh
they gave you john duty
Wow
someone looks like they got they got worse news than us
i do not know about you but i am cheered up already
i may have just lost my pitcher to a brain surgery
but but i am telling you i i can pitch
Honey you were a pro ballplayer
Come on
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him i can pitch
i have never seen her pitch
you are a pro ballplayer
Well former
i am a pro shipping clerk now
can you play tomorrow
Doesn't he have to work here
i i i will hire you now and fire you after the game
you are now my administrative assistant
can not i be something cool
like a vascular surgeon or
you can be whatever you want if you help us beat Seattle Pres
i can help you beat Seattle Pres
i am telling you i can pitch
Hey Grey i was just in giving the Tyson family an update on their preemie and the mom's complaining of chest pains
Already called Altman for a consult
okay great
uh did you have you talked to Karev
about
Well well the court asked for Zola's medical records
Why
Well it is pro it is probably nothing
i mean do not read anything into it
i just
i thought you should know
Thanks
Mm
Interactive properties of islet cells
is is that Bailey's thing
i am working with Bailey on this
i thought Bailey was pissed at you
no
no we are good
okay
Good then
next in line
Hey
um i am trying to get some information about this adoption case
the name is Zola
Family services

Requests for information can be made in writing to family services
uh look i am her doctor
and uh they subpoenaed her medical records
i can not take your files
Look i am not asking you to

never mind
next
where do i write
what is the address
this address
Office of family court services fifth floor
Fifth floor
Thanks
uh so C T' s negative for internal bleeding so chief Hunt says Mr Shatler's all yours
oh that is super
Hey tell chief Hunt i am so grateful he gave me the go ahead
okay
W was that sarcastic
Sorry
um hey is there any chance you need an assist on that hand
i need more O R time
Sure
Go schedule an O R
oh and uh wish me luck
i am about to tell a guy his crappy day just got crappier
Considering all you went through you were lucky really
that sounds like a setup for bad news
uh
some of the bones in your hand were pulverized
oh
there was extensive nerve and tissue damage
i will know more once we get in the O R and clean it up but there is a chance you could lose these two fingers
Look i know it is a shock
Damn it
but you survived a terrible accident
Son of a whoa
Holy crap
what are you
uh wh what are you doing
oh no no that is not a weapon
um that that is a a spitsticker
i i do
i do woodcarving um wood prints
i uh i carry this stuff with me
' cause i have a lot of downtime on my job
i
okay
um i am sorry
it is just you kinda
yeah
and that scared the hell outta me
i was just looking for my phone to to call my wife
okay
are you gonna freak out if i stick my hand in here again
no
Wow
this this is gorgeous
can i
yeah
Wow
do you
do you sell this stuff
no no
Collecting garbage pays the bills
this this this keeps me sane
Mm
or it did till today
you might want to leave the room
she is gonna be pretty upset
Make sure you uh tell her that i am
i am something of an artist myself
how about now
any lights
yeah
Supplemental motor area
Great
i just paralyzed the whole left side
so she is completely paralyzed
we hit the right side earlier
Mm
all right
Let's try another angle
Ding
Damn
what was that
Fornix
Ooh through to the basilar
so she'd be uh
Mute memory loss brain dead
how is it going
i just can not find a clean approach
Lexie shut down the monitor
i guess i owe the mom a surgery
no no no
no not yet
not yet
Try it again
all right now you are really getting on my nerves
i am just practicing my coaching skills
Seriously Shepherd
Pick up the damn probe
all right
Turn it back on
Ding
oh
Hey
Teddy gave me a marathon angioplasty
her Great thing was a plumbing job
they have subpoenaed Zola's medical records
Well that that is good
it is movement
what are you doing
i am gonna e mail Janet and see if she knows anything
we are keeping the faith right
Did i mention i can not crack this islet cell thing either
i have been researching responses all day to an insulin challenge and just nothing
See that that right there
Ooh yeah
that used to be a curly fry
and i used to be a surgeon
Ooh
Janet
you are right
you keep the faith
Dear client i will be out of the office all week
i have been picturing her making calls fighting the good fight to get me my kid back not sitting on a beach somewhere
i know
Mer
Zola's probably forgotten us by now
uh hey
uh
Excuse me
um i am trying to get some information about an adoption case
i am sure you will make a wonderful father but until the judge rules a case closed i ca
oh i am not the dad
i am the doctor
the kid's sick and
Sweetheart i have heard every sad story in the book
it doesn't change the fact that we do not release information on pending cases
you know i uh
i could not help but notice the dysplastic nevus
the mole
what
yeah anyone ever check that for you
yes but they said it is not dangerous
not now anyway
me
i would not take that chance
oh dear
oh right
Crappy government insurance
that would be on the deductible
Hey look i am a surgeon
you give me the stats on this kid
i will take care of you for free
yeah she is on judge Brentner's docket
Let's see if uh
oh wait
he is not even here today
he is getting chemo
so sad
Prostate
Mm
Hey you are a doctor
is that one of the bad ones
Mm not necessarily
Depends on where he is getting it treated
it could be postpartum cardiomyopathy
i will transfer her to telemetry
okay
Hey Dr Altman
Why is Cristina doing an angioplasty
Excuse me
i was just wondering and i know she was too
is is this all going somewhere
i mean i know it is none of my business but
you are right
as a first year you do an angio to learn a technical skill but an angio as a fifth year is about learning respect
Respect for the heart disease that Cristina will see for the rest of her career
it all starts there in the artery
you have to go back to the beginning to understand the end
Back to the beginning
all right so move Avery to shortstop and put Bailey in center field
Bailey
Why Bailey
Well because Bailey's a leader
she will know who to get the ball to
she is not your cutoff man
Avery he is your cutoff man
she is tall
where do you have her
uh left field
can she catch
uh let's find out
Grey catch
Hunt what the hell
now he is your cutoff man
yeah
i have been looking for you
i need my mother's journals
Why
what is up
Well i need to see her original hypothesis
if i am gonna figure out what is going on then i need to start where she started
Aha
Aha
i knew once you picked it up you could not put it down
do not gloat
where are they
Come on
Nice
uh the patient and her mother are wondering if she is having surgery today
should i tell them that you are still working
we are working
sometimes the body thinks better than the brain
Grey toss him a ball
hello
yeah
yeah
i thought the board meeting would be pushed to thursday
oh your swing's too high
Did you play ball
yeah
i was a pitcher
Really
yeah
Right into the parking
Mark's in love
oh with an eye doctor
that should last 48 hours
yeah well i should be happy for him
do not worry about
Just shake it off or shake it out or i do not know shake something
it is his new coaching persona
i am still working on it
you are still coming at it wrong
you you are coaching the ball wrong
i am holding the bat wrong
no no no
it is not the bat it is your body
you need to adjust your head drop your shoulder
Wait
you are not connecting
the head's the wrong angle
i have been adjusting the probe
we need to readjust the angle of the head
i went back to the lab to test my approach
there is a very good shot
i can access the tumor from above
i think we can get it all
a good shot
this is my child
Mm
Well there are risks either way uh but this certainly has more risks
so she could die in surgery
Look thank you for trying Dr Shepherd but i
i can not let my little girl be your guinea pig
Mrs Bayer now in all your research have you ever found a story of a kid with an H H tumor who ever got better who ever got a job had a life
this is the best shot you will have
Altman
Sloan you are on first
oh Bailey you are center field
we are doing some shuffling
what are you doing here
i work here
uh i may not even make the game
i got 49 trial patients left to call
i gotta give them the same bad news i gave you
Ouch
that is rough
we need a sub for center field
yeah
uh Shepherd pitcher
Shepherd's out
he told me his brain surgery could be a marathon
oh
me
Let me pitch
okay
all right Altman pitcher
yes
Sloan first
Shepherd can be a pinch hitter
okay Torres you are on
i need you to sign for this
Bone plates and titanium mesh
that is a lot of hardware
Mm hmm
i thought you said this guy's hand was not salvageable
yeah well i am gonna try and rebuild it
it is gonna be really cool
April meet me in the O R
i need a small
oh they are all larges
what
no
we can not be out of smalls already
i told them we needed an assortment of sizes
i
i was very clear on the phone
Sweet
i will look fantastic in this
and when you look good you play good
Am i right Avery
you know it
what the hell was that
what
what are you guys pledging delta chi together
no Sloan's pretty cool actually
he is uh been in such a good mood lately he is letting me do half his procedures
he let me run the burn center last night
Neat
okay Grey you are uh
Winning is an attitude
we are winners
yeah
okay so this will hold his hand in place so i can see the tendon and nerve gaps and
what the chief doesn't realize is that a lot of the work i do makes it possible for these surgeries to take place
i mean all the all the staffing and scheduling i
i mean so maybe okay maybe i am not in the O R all the time
April
but i
do you want to be an administrative assistant
is that what makes your heart sing
no of course not
then stop being a whiner
Stop hiding behind paperwork
if you love it do it
Just get in the O R
okay
do not sleep do not eat
Just do this
here
you want me to place the K wire
will it make your heart sing
yes
yeah right
okay placing the wire
okay
oh you are a little too far to the left
okay i got it
Sorry
there you go
Right there
Good
that is all right
i did not do anything
i swear
Damn it
no just stop
what is going on
i do not know but his pressure's tanking
i am hanging blood
it looks like electrical alternans
he is tamponading
what the hell
Page cardio
These things i need done
is that okay
Mm hmm
Mm hmm
Thank you
Thank you
Sorry
what is that
uh my mom's journal
no i know what it is
Why do you have it
because it is my mom's journal
Freeze it
Intraluminal flap and pericardial effusion
Damn it
he is got a dissection
that is why he fell
it must have started when he was on the truck
he probably passed out
oh god
uh we need to get Altman
Why
do we need to go
yes we need to open him right now
um April start the thoracotomy
what
me
what what are you doing
Getting gowned and gloved
Crack his chest
but i i am assisting
i it is all right
i got this
Go do your thing
but i have never done an aortic dissection
April crack his chest now
um 10 blade
here you go doctor
Thank you
okay here is the tear
okay open the aorta longitudinally
now transect proximal to the innominate artery
are you sure you do not want to do this
you are already there
all right
what do we have
a thoracic aortic dissection
uh Kepner excised the defect and he is going to need a graft
all right
Let me get scrubbed
you will first assist
Torres can you clear out
can you work around me
uh i mean I'd
i will move if i have to but
Torres i am trying to
i know but trust me i am saving his life too
can you work around me
Fine
Yang why did not you just start the graft
i did not need to
Kepner had it
okay
i have got some of it but i need to change the angle to get the rest of it
okay let's release the mayfield please
i need you to hold the probe steady so i can adjust the angle
you are not taking it out
it is too risky
if we go outside of the track we could hit healthy brain tissue
Come on
Take the probe
Hold it still
Move it even 1 millimeter it is over
Ready
Let's give it a whirl
okay good
i think
the tumor's dropped into the field
Let's tighten the device
okay
Good job
okay let's start the aspiration
Very slowly
Go ahead
Heart rate's 130
what is happening
the tumor is pulling on the hypothalamus
Push 20 of labetalol please
Grey hold the retractor
Let me take this
Heart rate's 160
Ah damn it
i am pulling out the probe
but you just said we are not g
no we do not have a choice
Well what do we do now
there is still tumor left
we try again
Why did not you just start the graft yourself
Why'd you wait
is this a trick question
no
i am asking
oh come on
now i am in trouble for waiting for you
you would've ripped me a new one if i did it myself
two months ago you would've bodychecked Kepner in order to get into this guy's chest and now you let her just do the surgery
and you do not even like Kepner
this is true
uh yes i could've done it myself but she had it
Exactly
i am done here
okay then could you girls take it outside
some of us have a long way to go
i give up
i have no idea what you are trying to do
i am in trouble if i cut
i am in trouble if i do not cut
i am a fifth year who does the work of an intern
what do you want
i want you to make a list
okay where uh on a blackboard
i will not do any surgeries without a safety helmet
i want you to make a list of every surgery that you have ever dreamed of performing
Shoot for the moon and i will try to get you some
because we are done
you have graduated
this is your present
you are messing with me
all right you know at at the beginning of this year you nearly killed Alex Karev in that O R
because you just had to get in there you had to be the best and you had to be first
but today today i saw a different surgeon every bit as good every bit as advanced but you were willing to work on a team
Today you put the patient before yourself
and that is who i wanted to see
so you are done
Make a list
what
what the hell are you doing in here
one second
in a second i am a kick you in your sorry
i just need to see if the cell survived
yes
yes
the cell survived
what are you talking about
my mom was wrong
it is oxygen
the cells are not getting enough oxygen
she extrapolated the amount delivered based on tests with mice but the internal structure of an islet cell of a mouse is completely different than that of a human
her hypothesis was wrong
that is why the islet cells in your device are dying
i marked the page for you
you mean it is gone
you got it all
yes we won't know where we are for a couple of days but yeah i i did
i i got it all
Wait
so so what
so so no more seizures and she won't freak out anymore
Well she is a teenager so chances are she might
yeah but not because of the tumor
the fingers they are all there
i had to build you a new skeletal framework jerry rigged some uh wire through these bolts here but um yeah saved your hand
will it work
it should
there will be some follow up surgery and physical therapy a lot of physical therapy but you should regain full mobility
i
it is beautiful
Thank you
See
i told you she was an artist
uh Mr Brentner
yes
how am i doing
uh well uh someone will b be in to speak with you shortly
Look i am sorry to bother you but i need to talk to you about something else
you have a kid on your docket
Zola
she is from Africa
i i am sorry but i can not discuss a case
Look just hear me out
i am i am Zola's doctor
she is got spina bifida
two doctors want to adopt her
they are just waiting to hear
but for weeks now she is been stuck in a foster home
this is highly inappropriate
a sick kid like that should not be with a foster family
she needs to be in a stable home with good parents these parents
without that she is only gonna get worse
Excuse me
Nurse
i need
i will be right with you
do not bother
i am leaving okay
i am leaving
Just
all i am asking for you to do is to take a look at this case
that is it
Please just take a look
Doctor
Attempting to influence a judge is a federal offense
Come on
Knock it out

i was not across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts
ROGER LAUGHS

These are not her boobies These are her breasts
Pheebs i was hoping for more of a change
i do not know why you are embarrassed
they were very nice boobies
Nice

i mean mittens are nice
okay
Rock hard place me
ROGER LAUGHlNG
you are so funny
he is really funny
i would not want to be there when the laughter stops
Whoa whoa
Back up there sparky
what did you mean by that
it seems that maybe you have intimacy issues that you use your humor to keep people at a distance
huh
i mean hey i just met you
i do not know you from Adam
Only child right
Parents divorced before you hit puberty
uh huh
how did you know
it is textbook
Hey you guys
you all know my dad right
how long are you in the city
a couple of days
i got a job midtown
i figure i am better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry
i do not know this one
oh
this is my friend Roger
hi
Good to meet you
ROGER
you too
what happened to the uh puppet guy
Dad uh
oh oh
Excuse me
so Ross uh how is the wife
ROSS GROANS
oh for two huh
Heh
uh Chandler quick say something funny
Gotta go
Ha ha
i miss you too
i love you but it is getting late now
Let me say hi
Hey Ma
Listen i made the appointment with Dr Bassida and
Excuse me
Did you know this is not Ma
her name's Ronni
she is a pet mortician
Sure
so how long have you been
Remember when you were a kid I'd take you to the Navy yard and show you the big ships
since then
no it is only been six years
i wanted to give you a nice memory so you'd know i was not always such a terrible guy
Joe have you ever been in love
i do not know
then you haven't
you are burning your tomatoes
Hmm
you are one to talk
Joe your dad's in love bigtime
and the worst part is it is with two different women
oh man
Please tell me one of them is Ma
of course one of them's Ma
what is the matter with you
it is like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life
he is like actually some spy working for the ClA
That'd be cool
this blows
i know
Why can not parents just stay parents
Why do they have to become people
Why do they have
Why can not you stop staring at my breasts
what
did not you get a good enough look the other day
all right we are all adults here
there is only one way to resolve this
since you saw her boobies i think uh you are gonna have to show her your pee pee
you know i do not see that happening
Come on
he is right
Tit for tat
Well i am not showing you my tat
INTERCOM BUZZES
hello
PHOEBE
it is Phoebe
ROGER
and Rog
Come on up
oh good
Rog is here
what is the matter with Rog
nothing
it is a little thing
i hate that guy
what
so he was a little analytical
that is what he does
Come on he is not that bad
that is where you are wrong
Why would i marry her if i thought on any level that she was a lesbian
i do not know
Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail
Ha ha
Why
Why would i
Why
Why
Why
Why
i do not know
Maybe low self esteem
Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling
Maybe
Wait
Go back to that sibling thing
Well i do not know
it is conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents' eyes
CHUCKLES
that is ridiculous
i do not feel guilty for her failures
oh so you think i am a failure
is not he good
yeah
no
that is not what i was saying
all these years i thought you were on my side but maybe you were sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd favor you
Hey i married a lesbian to make you look good
you are right
i mean you are right
it was not just the Weebles but it was the Weeble Play Palace and the Weeble's Cruise Ship which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in
that is tough tough stuff
Pheebs if we are gonna catch that movie we gotta go
okay
Feel better okay

you see most people when their pets pass on they want them laid out like they are sleeping

Hey Pheebs
MONlCA

Good
oh oh
Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys
CHANDLER CHUCKLES
so what is going on

it is just that uh

there is something about
Ahem
Basically we just feel that he is uh
we hate that guy
MONlCA
we hate him
we are sorry Pheebs
uh huh
okay
do not you think maybe it is just that he is so perceptive that it freaked you out
no i hate him
no we hate him
i am sorry
KNOCK ON DOOR
Ma
what are you doing here
i came to give you this and this
Ow
Big ring
Why did you fill your father's head with that garbage about making things right
Things were fine the way they were
there is chicken in there
Put it away
for God's sake Joey
Really
Hold on
you knew
of course i knew
what do you think
Your father is no James Bond
you should have heard his cover stories
i am sleeping over at my accountant's
i mean what is that
Please
so then how could you
do you remember how your father used to be
Always yelling
nothing made him happy
not that wood shop not those stupid little ships in the bottle
now he is happy
i mean it is nice
he has a hobby
Ma i do not mean to be disrespectful but what the hell are you talking about
i mean what about you
me
i am fine
Look honey in an ideal world there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting
and i will tell you something else
Ever since that poodle stuffer came along he is been so ashamed of himself that he is been more attentive
he is been more loving
it is like every day is our anniversary
i am happy for you
Well do not be
because now everything's screwed up
i just want it the way it was
JOEY
Ma i am sorry
i just did what i thought you'd want
i know you did cookie
oh i know you did
so tell me
Did you see her
yeah
you are 10 times prettier than she is
that is sweet
could i take her
with this ring no contest
ROGER
what is wrong sweetie
PHOEBE
nothing
no no
what is wrong
Come on
okay
it is nothing
i am fine
it is just um
it is my friends
they have a liking problem with you in that um they do not
oh
they do not
but you know they do not see all of the wonderfulness that i see
they do not see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff
they think you are a little
what
Intense and creepy
oh
but i do not
me
Phoebe
Well i am not at all surprised they feel that way
you are not
See that is why you are so great
Actually it is quite typical behavior when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic
you know this kind of codependent emotionally stunted sitting in your stupid coffeehouse with your stupid big cups which i am sorry might as well have nipples on them
and you are all like oh define me
Define me
Love me
i need love
so you talked to your dad huh
yeah
he is gonna keep cheating on Ma like she wanted
Ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does
and my sister Tina can not see her husband anymore because he got a restraining order
which has nothing to do with it except that i found out today
Wow
Things sure have changed here on Walton's mountain
so Joey are you okay
yeah i guess
it is just
you know they are parents
after a certain point you gotta let go
Even if you know better you gotta let them make their own mistakes
and just think in a couple years we get to turn into them
oh please
if i turn into my parents i will either be an alcoholic blond chasing after 20 year old boys or i will end up like my mom
Hey
ALL
Hey Pheebs
MONlCA
how is it going
okay except i broke up with Roger
ALL
oh
yeah right
ALL
no no really
Aw
what happened
Ugh
i do not know
i mean
he is a good person and he can be really sweet
and in some ways i think he is so right for me
it is just i hate that guy
Hey Joey
what is going on
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express
next stop Rachel Green
MONlCA JOEY YELL

Honey it is always about the guys
and since i will be away on that photo shoot for a week

Well i am just surprised you haven't made your move before now

Concerned

GRUNTlNG
Shayera he got John

Vixen what is happened
the Shadow Thief attacked us
he took John
and he said i was next
Unless you know any other Thanagarian harpies

what is wrong with this picture
hello
Carter
MAN GROANlNG
Did you hear that
SHADOW THlEF
Welcome Shayera
we have been waiting for you
Thank you for saving me the trouble of tracking you down
SCREAMS
GRUNTlNG
i have got you baby
GRUNTlNG
BONES COLLAPSlNG
MOANS
i warned you before to stay out of this
See what happens to naughty girls
HAWKMAN
Get away from her
Hawkman
the cast is complete
GRUNTlNG
GROANS
you always were good with that thing
Just hit him
Right
GRUNTlNG
Rest easy warrior
GROANS
oh
GRUNTS
SHADOW THlEF
of course you recognize the Absorbacron
despite your best efforts to bury me alive
i managed to retrieve it
where is Vixen
Out of the way
she is not part of this
GRUNTlNG
that machine is Thanagarian technology
it is a telepathic database more complex than anything on earth
and it is broken
she might be right
when i touched it before the feedback
Hush now
Watch and learn
Eight thousand years ago two Thanagarian law officers found themselves stranded on a primitive planet
this planet
Katar and Shayera Hol used their technology to make the desert bloom and build the greatest city on earth
the people loved them and despite their protests worshipped them as gods
for decades their ever growing empire was a utopia
but nothing lasts forever
at least nothing good
our armies are victorious my liege
they continue to bring the gifts of Thanagar to the rest of the world
Hath Set
i wish to speak to my husband
Alone
as you wish my queen
what troubles you Shayera
Why ask what you already know
i want to bear your child Katar
i do not want to have this conversation again
Why the hurry
you are a young woman
there is plenty of time
Thirty or 40 years at most
i am not a girl anymore
you look the same as you did the day i met you
when my work is complete after i have tamed this savage continent
you will set out to conquer the rest of the world
it is my duty
we owe these people the peace and stability that comes from Thanagarian rule
i am not arguing that
but you also have a duty to continue your bloodline
or are you so tired of me that you do not even
i love you Shayera Hol
nothing will ever change that
it is just that right now i need to concentrate on
HORSE WHlNNlES
the general
CROWD CHEERlNG
it is the general
Hail King Katar
Hail Queen Shayera
Bashari
no need to stand on ceremony my friend
what news do you bring
Victory
the land of Kahndaq has been freed from Ahk ton's rule and placed under your benevolent protection
as tribute Teth Adam sends 100 of the finest stallions on earth
WHlNNYlNG
my husband and i travel on the winds general
what good are horses to us
i will show you
i begin to see the worth of these beasts Bashari
i thought you might my lady with the right company
LAUGHS
if you desire my company you will have to ride faster
Hyah
GASPlNG
Save some for me
Hey
LAUGHS
i should have kept it for myself
you are wasting it
Ah
Katar's my husband
and my best friend
I'd leave him for you
I'd never ask
i am afraid that you would
Katar needs you
and i need you
it can not be true
no of course not
Bashari would never betray your friendship in such a manner
and the queen's trustworthiness is of course beyond reproach
then why pester me with idle gossip
it is just that these ugly rumors undermine your authority
and i must admit
no i speak out of turn
you speak when i command it Hath Set
they spend a great deal of time together
they give the appearance of impropriety
i trust Bashari with my life
and Shayera is my life
i will hear no more of this nonsense Hath Set
Leave me
now
as you say my liege
you did not have to do that
i can fly
when we are together so can i
i wish they were dead
DROPS TRAY SCREAMS
GRUNTS
what is it
Answer me woman
no
Ho
SNlFFS
Poison
Just as you wished my liege
i did not
i never meant
Get out
my liege i
i only
i said get out
Shayera
CHALlCE SHATTERlNG
now you can let go
you are Hath Set
you are the one who poisoned us
i mean
no my Queen
i think Hawkman knows who i am
i am your darkest thoughts your unspeakable desires
i am you Katar Hol
no
SHADOW THlEF
when you first touched the Absorbacron you freed me to do everything you wanted
you wanted the secrets of Thanagarian technology
i found them for you
you wanted to be a hero
i became an arch villain for you to vanquish
you want this woman

Come onsync alphamale
Good evening ladies
has your husband recently acquired a faraway look in his eyes
in the event something unforeseen happens to you do all of your worldly goods go to him
is he at this moment nervously excusing himself from the room
if you have answered yes to all the above questions you receive a score of 100
a gold star for neatness
and my advice to leave for mother's immediately
that is immediately after the conclusion of our program
our story tonight is called
the Orderly World of Mr Appleby
Unfortunately it will do nothing to relieve your fears
if that is what you want
if you want contentment security peace of mind
listen to this advice from our friendly philosopher
now this Gothic bell is very old 16th century
it makes a very attractive gift
no i am afraid that is too commonplace
this jewel box is lovely
i am afraid that is not for sale either
everything that is the least bit good seems to be spoken for
Well
many of the pieces are quite fragile
i would appreciate it if you did not handle them
Good afternoon
may i show you something
yes
you might tell me where this came from
Please be careful
this is a very valuable antique
yes i know
it is 14th century Tuareg from the Sahara is it not
as a matter of fact it did come from the Sahara
yes Mr Appleby
but it came by way of Ankara
from where incidentally i have just come
then you must be
are you from the Dizar Company
i am Dizar Company
Dizar and Son
i am Son
what a pleasant surprise
Your father supplied me with so many of my rarest treasures
a man of great taste i have often wanted to meet him
i have come in his place
Well we must have a drink to celebrate the occasion
Let's go into my office
Please be seated Mr Dizar
Thank you
but Moslems do not drink liquor
Coffee of course very thick and very black
i have never been to Turkey or abroad at all
but with my treasures from these fabulous places all around
i often feel like a world traveler
Thank you
Your treasures do not appear to sell Mr Appleby
Business hasn't been good
People just do not seem to want antiques
the lady in the shop she wanted to buy several pieces
of course but they'd already been sold
Interesting
Antiques do not sell and yet they sell
but whether they sell or not you owe Dizar and Son 12 000 that must be paid
i had no intention of doing otherwise
in two weeks
two weeks
i haven't got it
you will get it soon
no
you see i haven't really sold them
i found i could not part with them
glass shattering
i just can not
that woman
Mr Appleby no
oh dear
Broken utterly broken
i am terribly sorry
i do not know how it could have happened
it is beyond repair
my beautiful camel
i know how you feel
sighs
it could never be replaced
Naturally i will pay you for it
Naturally
it is only worth a 1 000
i am afraid i do not have that much with me
would a check be satisfactory
a check
yes if you would lend me a pen please
yes of course
Thank you
to whom should i make it payable
to Lawrence Appleby
Lawrence Appleby
1 000
there you are
and please forgive my awkwardness
These things do happen Mrs Sturgis
Miss
Good day Mr Appleby
Good day
now you only owe 11 000
Balance in two weeks please
i told you Mr Dizar it is utterly impossible
Perhaps you will be fortunate enough to have more clumsy women enter your shop
i should hope not
then you leave me no choice but to take your treasures and sell them myself
Take them from me
you can not be serious
i am most serious Mr Appleby
if you cannot raise the money no no no i will raise it
i will raise it somehow
Perhaps i can get a loan from the bank or something
i do not know
i do not know but you will get your money
music playing
music stops
Hey
do you have to have that thing blasting all the time
i like it
Goodness knows i do not have any other company around here
you won't even let me have a cat
you know very well a cat would scratch up the furniture
who cares
you do not obviously
and you never hang anything up
you do not even clean up the place
you know i can not stand disorder
can not stand it
can not stand it
you are as fussy as an old maid
you can not stand a speck of dust in that fancy shop of yours either
and what good does it do
Nobody ever buys anything
stammers
i do not want to quarrel with you Lena
you are right about the shop
Lena i have got some serious business troubles
i am going to have to raise some money 11 000 11 000
Just where do you think you are gonna raise that kind of money
from you i hope from your endowment policy
you have got a nerve
i am sorry Lena
i must insist
Insist all you want
it is not gonna do you any good
' cause you have got to have my signature and i am not signing
i know what you'd do with that money just go out and buy some more treasures
no i won't
Well you are not getting it so forget it
door shuts
Lena
Lena yeah
would you bring me a glass of water please
who was your servant last year
Please Lena
i am getting it
door opens
Lena screams
dialing
Operator
i want to report an accident
i am sorry i had to insist on payment Mr Appleby
but my father in Ankara does not understand these delays
Different countries different ways of doing business
i hope your father will continue to send me his wonderful objet d'art
he writes that he is found some excellent Hittite things
Hittite
how perfectly splendid
Please you must ask him to send me some at once
Well there is a great demand
if it could be paid on delivery
that is impossible
i haven't a cent left from my wife's estate
Surely there are customers
the so nice lady who broke your camel
Martha Sturgis
she must be very rich
i could not say
if you wish to talk about it you know where i can be reached
yes i know
Good day
Good day
Why it is that lovely jewel box
i thought you said it had been sold
the customer who bought it changed her mind
i remembered how much you admired it
i simply had to bring it to you
but i could not possibly accept
Please i was very rude that day
it would make me feel much better
Your behavior was perfectly understandable Mr Appleby i assure you
and certainly not worth this much
you must let me buy it
but then i would feel like a door to door salesman
no Mr Appleby i am sorry but it would be improper for me to accept such an expensive gift
from a man you hardly know
that is true but
no you are terribly terribly kind but you must let me send a check
Very well if you insist
yes
but i warn you Miss Sturgis
i shall make a point of getting much better acquainted so i can present a proper apology
i am sure you have much more important things to do Mr Appleby
Neither as important nor as attractive
may i call on you again sometime
i should be happy to have you do so
Come in Mr Appleby
Good evening Ella
i believe Ms Sturgis is expecting me
yes
Martha
Good evening Mr Appleby
Thank you
what a delightful picture you make sitting there
i wish i were an artist
you are such a flatterer
i do not know what i am going to do with you
i have a suggestion
you have
yes
Martha i wish you'd marry me
who me
you do not know what you are saying
i know exactly what i am saying
there comes a time to every Ionely man when he can no longer bear his Ioneliness
if he is fortunate enough to meet a woman to whom he can give all his respect and tender feelings he must say so
or deserve his Ioneliness
but you have so much Mr Appleby
Lawrence
Lawrence you have so much you have your shop all your lovely works of art
i am afraid you'd find me inadequate
i would find you delightful all the rest of our days
no no no you must understand
it is just that i have waited so long it'd be foolish to rush in now
it would be better not to get married at all than risk marriage with a man who is not interested in me stuttering
in my happiness
i should have no other interest but you my dear
and your curios
Well yes my curios
that would be all right as long as i come first
then it is settled
i would like you first to see our lawyer Mr Gainsboro
since my father died he is taken his place
i would not like to do anything without his approval
of course i quite understand
my dear
in my capacity as Miss Sturgis' legal adviser
i am sometimes called on to give counsel in matters of the heart
in short matrimony
Quite naturally
in so doing one must be aware that Miss Sturgis' considerable fortune may be the main objective
i have no knowledge of or interest in Martha's money
Nevertheless that fact exists
however Miss Sturgis is prepared to put that thought out of her mind
if you are prepared to meet all other obligations of marriage
i am
Mr Appleby have you ever been married
yes
Divorced
Good heavens no
Very good
if the question seemed impertinent in these days of moral laxity
i can assure you sir
i am as far from moral laxity as any human being can be
i have no vices
i am sure of it
Nevertheless i have counseled Ms Sturgis against any precipitate action
she is decided to consider it for one month before giving you her answer
a month
and in that time if you will take the advice of an old man court her assiduously
Constancy devotion
Remember she is a woman and i believe they are all very much alike
yes i believe they are
as executor for the Sturgis estate
i have drawn up this document
it merely provides that each of you is heir to the other's property
you have no objection to signing this
no of course not
now for the final proviso something very near and dear to Martha
exclaims
you have been so understanding
i know i am peculiar in many ways
but enchanting
what is the item Mr Gainsboro
that after the marriage you will take up your residence here in this house where Martha was born and where she has always lived
Mr Appleby here
not for one moment would i consider taking her out of a setting that is so perfect for her
it is been her home it will be mine
i can never understand how women can be so disorderly
you look tired dear
i will clear this up later
Come over here and tell me about your day
i have had a frightful day
Dizar is threatening to foreclose on my stock
Why is that
i am behind in my payments on some Hittite specimens
if i do not raise 7 000 i will lose them
Let them have their old curios
you do not seem to understand Martha
i could lose the shop
would that be such a bad thing
it doesn't pay
and then you could stay at home with me
I'd go out of my mind
phone ringing
no that will be Mr Gainsboro
does he have to call every night
now Appie he has called every night since my father died
all those years i have lived alone he can not get out of the habit
he only wants to know that i am all right
hello
yes Mr Gainsboro
yes thank you i am well
yes he is here
yes fine
sighs
cat meows
Martha
Martha yes dear
you are late
every night you get home later and later
what is that thing
that is Dicky
i bought him to keep me company
you are away so much
Cats are destructive
you know what a mess they make
i do not mind
Martha
i must have 7 000 by tomorrow
are you hungry Dicky
what would you like for supper
Fish
Haven't you been listening to me
Dizar and Son have given me until noon tomorrow
i will lose my shop
it will be no great loss i am sure
I'd much rather have you home here with me
you won't lend it to me
no dear i am afraid not
it will be nice having you here
you will see what fun it will be
Come on Dicky
i will give you a nice saucer of milk
Dicky meows
you are surely not going to feed that beast from a piece of Sevres china
you and your old curios
Martha dear
would you bring me a glass of water please
Martha Just a moment dear
door opens
here you are Appie
was that how you did it before
was it accident or murder
yes i found the book
Even then i did not believe it
i suppose deep down in my heart i did
that along with what Mr Gainsboro found out about the first Mrs Appleby it would have been rather hard to ignore
i have no idea what you are talking about
Perhaps you'd like to see the documents Mr Gainsboro has collected
i am sure the authorities would find them extremely revealing
i see
no doubt you will expect me to leave at once
that was my first emotion
and it is certainly what Mr Gainsboro is urging
but what would you do
Marry other unsuspecting women and murder them too
i feel it is my duty to protect them from you
no Appie
i married you long after I'd given up hope of ever getting married
i will make the best of it
you are to give up the shop and spend your days here with me
here
it is impossible
you have no choice in the matter
all the arrangements have been made
there is a letter in Mr Gainsboro's safe that would certainly hang you if i were to die under whatever circumstances
and Mr Gainsboro will continue to call here every night at this hour to see that i am well and happy
phone ringing
Answer it
phone ringing
phone ringing
hello
Mr Gainsboro Let me speak to Mrs Appleby
i am sorry i am afraid she can not come to the phone right now
i will give her a message
this is Sidney Gainsboro and i want to speak to your wife immediately
Mr Appleby i will give you precisely ten seconds to have her on the phone
it is for you
screams
Martha
Appleby ten seconds
do you hear me
Your time is up
oh well the bigger they come the harder they fall
by the way what you have just seen is of historical significance
it was in precisely this way that a housewife carrying an armload of vegetables invented the tossed salad
now before i say goodnight my sponsor would like to bring you an important message
i needn't tell you to whom it is important
that concludes our entertainment for tonight
Once again through a propaganda play we have attempted to make the world a better place in which to live
i am confident that tonight we struck a telling blow in the cause of wall to wall carpeting
GoodnightPolice siren
Gentlemen you are all responsible officers of Defense Police lntelligence
you all understand the seriousness of the matter to be discussed
Whatever is to be said will be not be enough
According to this CBl report the powers responsible for this violence erupting all over those business groups whose job is adulteration racketeering
those smuglers that sold drugs are now smuggling arms as well
These are not different gropus
there is a much bigger organization
and behind this orgaization is the might of someone foreign
Hail Mogambo
Hail Mogambo
after the government godowns were set on fire wherever there was a shortage of food in the country adulterated food at black market prices has been spread
there are over a lakh of liquor and gambling dens now in the country
there will be over a crore profit from adulterated food
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY satisfied
Daaga Teja
this crore of rupees invest in other nefarious activities
within lndia this violence and destruction this stealing fighting riots breakouts
ALL of this if it continues as is that day is not too far when Mogambo's dream will be for real
we need a place on the Bombay shores where from we can smuggle arms as we wish when we wish
Preparations wil be done
Absolutely
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY
lgnorant and uncouth lndians have not learnt a thing from their history as yet
as and when they have fought foreign forces have enslaved them
to date they continue fighting
LET THEM FlGHT
on the basis of religion
language race whatever weapons they need to fight
Mogambo will give them
and when the foundations of this country are destroyed THEN then i will take the next step and all of lndia will be at my feet
and every lndian my slave then all the world will cheer
Hail Mogambo the King of lndia
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY
mechanical whirring bubbling
you you you
Jump jump jump
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY
the day i find that formula
which formula
Using which one cannot be seen
turns invisible
Think
These soldiers that would do anything were invisible
who could fight them
an invisible man such a formula
about 20 years back an lndian scientist had invented such a formula
he is dead but did not give the formula to anyone
an invisible man such a formula
how could this be
Why not
Science is moving so rapidly
it would be wrong to say that what was not possible then is not posible now
i am not going too far in history about 100 150 years
those days if someone claimed that steel planes would fly going 1000 miles in a few hours people would call him crazy
but planes were made and no one questions their existence
to King Akbar if someone was to speak of phones radio cars he would not believe it
that we cannot see we refuse to believe
lfwe had spoken of transparent photographs that could see inside us
they would have laughed exactly as you all do now
but X Ray is a common thing now
Sir
yes Raman
how X ray could see within can science make someone invisible
what nonsense
there is no such thing
but Sir you had said that
Please sit down this is no time for jokes
we want Dr Jagdish Verma that formula give it to us
at no cost
do not be a fool
lfyou do not your assistant
Prof Sinha will give it to us at a price
that is why do not be a fool
Give us that formula
we will give you your price
you cannot buy me
i will call the Police
NO Mr Sinha
Catch him should not escape
oh
Raman what is it
Sir i think i have upset you
it is no such thing
Actually it was my fault
Your question was appropriate
but the right to answer is his
Sir whose picture is this
he was a well renowned Scientist Raman you had met Arun
he is Arun's father remember
the one you said had several children
yes he is the one
he grew up an orphan maybe that is what pains him
Wherever he sees an orphan child he takes them home
what is his home but a small huge Hostel
Calendar oh
Calendar oh my egg
what is it Arun brother like a madman are you yelling for me
this i cannot understand yet why your parents named you'Calendar'
Well they wanted to name me something in English
Even if they had named you Queen Elizabeth you would still be a cook here
ln english Cook where were you
i was dead in my room
Die where you want but why is it that i have to cook over halfthe breakfast every morning
Why is it
Answer me
it is your luck whose mistake is it
the mistake is you do not know difference between sleep and death
People who sleep wake up you refuse to wake up
See Calendar if you awake late tomorrow something will be deducted from your pay
Sure at least that way i will be paid
by God its been 5 years this way i could see a salary
what colour is it
the colour of Brinjal Eggplant
do hear the Morning News
the food ration is almost'finished'
we will bring some from the grocers
second news landlord came for rent

Good Morning

one by one go to the bathroom get ready
Hurry
Brush up
Arun brother it would ne so nice if these unexpected showers would stop
Dear Jugal if you will were to wake up without same and go to school that would be so nice
Brother why are schools in the morning
because everything starts in the morning Life sleeps at night awakes in the morning
lfwe have to walk with life we have to wake up in the morning
Why are Mondays always after Sundays
Just as sadness after happiness happiness after sadness night after day day after night Monday is after Sunday and after Saturday is Sunday

Madam
you always mentioned that father was a renowned scientist
and that he invented something beyond compare in the world
what was that thing
what was that thing people would not believe it
but you are his son
i will tell you
it was a gadget that by turning on would make someone invisible
an lnvisible man
how is that possible
Why cant you see in the dark
because there is no light uhh
Why can you see in the light
i will tell you
because the light bouncing off of someone makes them visible
but if there was something created that would allow the light to go
Did not understand
Like glass
Light hits the glass and passes through hence its invisible
i see you will do not believe me
no no Mr Sinha lfyou say so
but where is that gadget to let light pass through the body
Your father destroyed the formula as he did not want it to be abused
but where is that thing
the gadget
you have it
Let that be
Did you find a paying guest

and how wonderful is she

Back

Catch him
do not let him escape
Sir could i make a call
but where to
the press
i meant where from
where is the phone
what is this
not a phone
this is a radio
Either you get wrong numbers or when you want to dial out you get to hear colourful programs Childish programs
two women talking of in laws
two business men talking about prices sometimes there is a discussion on love between two lovers simply amazing
hello Mr Daga what do you want
Gold Silver Rifles
and hand grenades
this evening come over to my place we will discuss these and also take care of your entertainment
how is that
you must have heard of Awala's famous dancer'Breeze Breezy'
Mr Wolcott we will paint your evenings with her colours
Breeze Breezy i have heard of her
i too have heard of her name
Today we will see her too
but where do i have to come
Powai Lake Bungalow no
24
Breeze
Breezy
Good i met you here
there is a letter for you
Mr Sinha's letter
Arun i am going far
but before i leave i want to share a secret with you that i never did
Your father audio trails off
Seems like there is no power
Whosoever put this adget around their wrist and clicks the button will turn invisible
Under these circumstances they can only be seen through red
light or glass as the gadget has no effect on the colour red
Except for that with a flip of the switch the person will become completely visible and no pair of eyes in the world can see them
what do you think Jugal
what should we do
Whatever Mr Sinha said is true
should i wear it
yes
should i turn on the switch
yes
yes
Arun brother
the lights
where are you
i am here Jugal
i can hardly se see you i really can not be seen
no
Absolutely not
no
i cannot believe that i am invisible
i cannot be seen even in the mirror Come take a look
i know that too
but how will you come back
should i press this button again
so you are back
i am back
now i can see you
this is amazing
Amazing lsn't it
should i disppear again
yes
no no no
Please come back
i am very scared
i can be seen
See
should i be invisible again
yes
my good brother
Please come back again
what is happening
i will go crazy
i will go crazy
Please do not do that
i may fall down
lfyou do that again
i will never talk to you
ln that case i will turn invisible forever
Jugal see those red pieces of glass there
bring one of those pieces here
now see me through them
i can see you in the red glass
and now
now i cannot see you
can you see me now
i can see you again
Beware of the red colour
i will save myself but Daga and Teja wherever they are who will save them from me
you Mr Dhaga thread not Dhaga Daga betray
this is Mr Teja Bheja brain Funny name
Teja Teja Bheja brain Bheja right
we have a special guest tonight Mr Wolcott
Boycott whom you have to entertain
Show Madam to her dressing room
Mr Daga why does she call me Bheja brain
Madam this is your room
you can have as much gold as you need
and i can supply you with guns and drugs
that is good we will take the gold and the guns and the drugs
before all that i need something the Golden Hanuman
Show it to me
do you recognise it
this statue is in the city's big Hanuman temple
this is very valuable in the foreign nations
we will definitely get you this statue
Let's set up the business first
where did Mr Daga goSOMEWHERE ELSE
Just as man is the measure of all things
the beginning and the ending the core of otherwise random lives each place is the centre of the universe
which also goes for our own community
in the cold eyes of the heavens we simply inhabit the same insignificant planet regardless of where or why
but obviously this is not the case
this is not how we see it from down here as we roam through fragrant forests finding our way between pines and fir
or when we raise our gaze to catch a sparrow in flight
then our location springs to life within us and we enliven the location
our hometown pulls us in like spring brings the migrant birds
Why is that
Better ask someone who knows
we here in Borunda know not only this region but each other as well
we feel for each other
he who seeks good finds goodwill but evil comes to him who searches for it
that is from Proverbs
every morning i open my Bible at random and read
and this morning it was Ecclesiastes
and Ecclesiastes tell us of
i know
but i would really like you to return to the events of that night
could we go over it again from the beginning
the kitchen you said
i know what i said
i know what i saw i told you that already
and you were in the kitchen
Certainly
in my kitchen
or do you mean some other kitchen
i mean your own
you saw them
i was checking the temperature and my first thought was
Right they are here
who
Romanians Albanians
Whatever
and i could not figure out what they were doing here
Why not pick Ove Karlsson
the fellow must have bushels of it at home
though i expect by now that he drank up most of it
Please concentrate on the actual events
Unless you'd like to take a break
Make
Make what
no break
i said take a break
Why
nothing that is just the way i feel
so it is over then
Just like that
is it
do not worry the door's solid
which is more than you could say about me
Six million kronor
Six million
Yet here i am a bloody loser
it is all right you do not have to say anything
my dirty laundry is my own
do not you have any clean sheets
Christ Anki
how long have we known each other
it must be about 30 years now
i have got to pick up Max at school in an hour
it is past one you know
so what is it going to be
you want to do it
i just need to
i need to take a shower first
no alarm system
this is not fancy like Stockholm
we never locked our doors
when was that 30 years ago
Nothing's changed
what about neighbours and stuff
it is cool
Smooth sailing
no one can see us from the lake side
and besides there are lots of other houses to choose from nearby
it is as easy as a pancake
an even zero
Animals or humans
a hard on
yes a hard on
i am just telling you the facts regardless of what you want to hear
or how unpleasant
i do not give a damn
we have an iron to go home to
Bye dear
there is only 800 here
i forgot to withdraw more cash
you will get the rest on Friday
Unless an old friend qualifies for a discount
what
a discount if you'd consider
i heard you the first time
Right and i was looking forward to seeing you
it is been ages since i was home
this happens all the time
what about next weekend
i do not know
no i am working next Saturday
how are things going
the house is almost done now
i meant you
do not be upset that i am ill
i am just concerned that is all
Hang on
i have got to go i will call you later
Look at him
Look
what a bloody pig
his mess lowers the prices in this neighbourhood by at least 100 grand
that fucking draining ditch
what is it been two years
there is got to be a law that would force him to fill those damn trenches
Looks like she is playing with one of those model airplanes
Imagine being under that
what
her the fatty over there
some cutie right
Why would she be on top of you
i do not know it was just something i said
i said imagine
where are you going
our hometown pulls us in
what forces lead us to return to abandon the buzz of the city for the burble of a brook
the calm
the silence
the security
the simple life some say
the closeness says yet another
the predictable life says a third
and to this i respond
Explain the gravity of the sparrow
Explain the flight of the snail
Explain the roar of the brook
Greatness can be housed in small packages
this weekend just is not good
you can not live like this
the guest room is not ready yet that is all
you have been drinking i can tell
i can come and get you if you like
Anytime you know that
Anneli
hello
hello
we haven't really talked have we
it is Anneli right
Roland Gransson
Welcome to the neighbourhood
everything going fine with the house
it is quite different from living in a big city like Stockholm
you are a teacher are not you
that is right
English and Swedish
Mostly for deaf ears unfortunately
it is nice to see Erik back in town again
i always figured it would be him and not Bengt who would take over the old place when the time came
have you settled on a date
Sorry
i talked to Erik a few weeks back about having you over for dinner
oh i do not know
Go ahead and talk to Erik and i will talk to Anki and we will see
Sure
Sounds like fun
you are a hairdresser right
yes at Pernilla's salon
do you do private sessions
what do you mean
do you cut hair off the clock
Well i guess
i do Erik's hair
are you unhappy with your barber
this might sound strange to you but i cut my own hair
it doesn't really make a difference
Well it does but
what the hell
no he is not going to sleep is he
every night he is on display
he could at least pull down the blinds
for God's sake speak Swedish
i wonder if it is the brewer's yeast that makes me sweat rivers like this
i can not go on like this
Shaking so badly the whole damn house is rocking
if i put a hand on the wall it stops but as soon as i take it away everything spins like i am in a dryer
i was staring at the ceiling
Wondering what the damn stuff is called
Fibre
Pasteboard
some stupid name
Guess it could be something in the soil though
that it is jinxed or something
are you coming
are you
no i do not want to
what do not you want
i do not want to do this
it is over
the whole damn thing is over
what do you mean
Take your money and leave
i am not going to do this anymore
yeah you say that a lot
Go
Get out
Name in November
Three letters name in November
Holy crap
O V E
Ove Christ
Lord give him strength
Give him the strength
all man's efforts are for his mouth yet his appetite is never satisfied
Indeed never satisfied
that is possible
it is society's most dangerous disease
the root of all evil
Solidarity
Fair play
Christian ethics
i use to say that i had three good things to lean on in life
the good book a good job and a good wrestling match
but if we could
Good wrestlers you know
Know when they have to go on fighting
Let's get back to that night
when you first saw them
Sodom
what do you mean
the hometown in our hearts is and always will be a place of open arms a sanctuary
the sense of community is a fortress of peace we build together in a collective effort generation after generation stone by stone
Monika speaking
Anneli
Anneli is that you
Let's go Ove
hello
Sorry i am late
is there room for one more
do not see those very often these days
what
Bags like that
they are nice
Serviceable
Roomy
yes it is
i have certainly had it for a while
he is good
who
Roland
but it is pretty difficult though
or maybe i do not have an ear for it
i do not care about grammar
i just want to improve my conversation in English
that is right neighbours
Want to forget about it
Turn around and leave
Guess not
then let's drop the subject
Bloody hot
you never want to
Talk about it
what is the point
you have already made your mind up
Listen to yourself
what you just said
where are you going
to get a napkin
Sorry
Sketch it for me
the house the surroundings
i can not draw
Christ we do not need a work of art
i just want to get a picture
i have told you everything
Show me
Go on draw like kid would
the lake
Abridge
we do not go there though
what the fuck is that
Borunda from an airplane
i told you i can not draw
that is the most pathetic thing i have ever seen
Christ
Whatever
Christ
hello
i need razor blades
what is going on
nothing
an old classmate i do not want to talk to
the guy with the long hair
no the other one
do not look
it can not be that bad
for you no
were you like enemies
no we barely talked
we weren't in the same class
you said you were classmates
Briefly
but then he went into a Special Education class
not sure he even finished junior high
i am not big on that kind of reunion
does he still live in Borunda
i do not think so
he moved in with his sister
his parents died they were really old when they had him
he was younger than his sister's oldest child
Krille Neefen
that is what we called him Neefen
Once in English we were reading vocabulary lists aloud in class
and he read the Swedish translations like they were in English
and pronounced kniv like neef
Rakapparat
Shaver
we thought it was funny
i bet he did not
how come you are so sure he did not vote for the Sweden Democrats
Your dad how do you know
do not start in on that again
Just say what you think
the man has brain damage
all i am saying is
that i should tell them to fuck off
Stand up for your beliefs
despite his injury
what was wrong with him before that
Maybe we should forget about this
Turn around and leave
the knife
you said that Olsson was bending over Nilsson
and that he was holding the knife
now you are saying that he came at you with the knife
that is right
which version
that he was standing where i said
Bending over Nilsson
Right and then he came at me
Let's drop Olsson for a while shall we
According to the autopsy
Petterson was hit right above the back of his right knee
yes
can you explain that
that is what i have been doing
Well so Petterson must have had his back to you when you shot him
does he say that
no i do
it is an undeniable fact
Eye of a bull
Did you tell him that
you sound afraid
Did you
no
Why did you call my home number
i wanted to hear his voice
i will pick you up tomorrow and we will take it from there
Anneli
what is wrong
i do not know
Anneli what is going on i
Anneli can you hear me
Anneli
Anneli
Why did not you answer me
when i called your name
i did not hear you
when will they be here
Seven
Your sister called

Like a drink
Careful
my ribs please
i am sorry i lost my temper
you are so hot
i love you
you know that right
what time is it
Seven

Want another beer

Re re remember me
Krille with the st st stutter

Wanna know what it feels like to drink piss
Cheers
you have really fixed the place up
how long have you been together you and Erik
Four years
what am i saying it is six years
do you like it here in Borunda
Country living
Scary business that thing that happened to Erik
in Stockholm
when he was on duty right
Just a millimetre or so from
is that right
he could just as well have died
the world is full of crazies
Well not here though
Except for Ralf the boy with the earphones
he seems pretty harmless
we will see how long he gets to stay at home this time
i think i will have another cigarette
you do that
i have been thinking of putting in a Jacuzzi too Again
i feel tempted
i have managed without for ten years so i will pass
it is just character
Reason is not always capable of triumphing over desire
anyone you know
no but you can still be neighbourly
Let's get this over with
it is just one night okay
Door's open
you are late
was there much traffic
no it was not bad
there is drinks in the box
i will get glasses

Wow

Really

Practically indecent
Torbjrn Ingvarsson
Married to Britta the checker
he has a petition to force that guy Ove to move away
he could get a lot of names
that is disgusting
but you have seen the mess haven't you
that bloody ditch around the house

a cool six million
it is his house
Anki and Ove used to be a couple
more than 30 years ago back in high school
Briefly
Ove's taking English

Tell me what happened

i will never set foot here again
i feel sick to my stomach
Disgusted

Bloody thorns

Old people need to pee
Come on
an even zero
Animals or humans
Sure this is the right place

i told you so
Jesus
some Schwarzenegger guy

Let's do this okay
Trust me

do not be so damn negative
Bloody hell
Too bad you did not bring a bowling ball
Give me the torch
Shit let's go
no way
what the
i can not breathe
all you do is sit there
no matter what he says
Blacks and homos and lesbos and on and on
and what a way to welcome us
Dad and i have already eaten
and then he gropes me
he gropes you
what
yes
not like that
Either he does or he doesn't
do not you see how he touches me
no and i want you to stop
he had a hard on
did not you notice
a hard on
yes a hard on
i am just telling you the facts regardless of what you want to hear
however unpleasant it is
i do not care
i do not give a damn
we have an iron to get home to
Rick up pick up
an iron
yes
Anneli Anneli
are you there
Anneli
nothing is forever
we cannot stop progress the merciless march of time
but we can defend what we believe in
what we nurture under glass
Seeds sprout regardless of the size of the plot
that is why we remain
Why we continue to tend our gardens in the place we call our hometown our place here on Earth
Borunda
the warmth of illusion
the hub of a random existence
the cold eyes of the heavens
a well made basket to lie in
Cold eyes
the eyes of the universe
Gee
who the hell do you think you are
do you really think you can break it off and go hide
you can have your money back if that is it
30 years
Doesn't that mean a damn thing
do not i mean anything
Max
Max
Look who is here it is Max
so you are going to town too
Nice to have some company
and you have got your clubs
you have got your golf
that is good Max
we all need something to cling to in times like these
as we ponder in the wilderness
it is just terrible what happened
a
a dark day forever carved into the bark of this community
Yet still an opportunity for communion and reflection
we must go on
we must raise above our despair no matter how hard it is to bear
we must never allow fear to take root within us
we are neighbours and we are bigger than that
is not that right Max
Max
Max get in
Ann Kristin
hello Allan
Max
Get in
are you going into town
Well yes
Good then i can ride along
i am going to the library
hello
i have something to tell you
i am busy right now
i have been with someone
what
i have been unfaithful
with Ove
what
Ove Karlsson
i can not hear what you are saying
i slept with Ove
Torbjrn
are you still there
that was a blow
that was one hell of a blow
Well then
we will be having a funeral
a double funeral
so we can expect a few guests maybe even from afar
i have to say a few words
Pen a few thoughts to recite
i was thinking of beginning with Setterlind's Death i picture thus
what do you think
what
oh that is nice
an old yeoman sings as he plies his fields
a basket of seeds on one arm he scatters as he goes beginnings and endings the cycle of life
he toils from sunrise to sunrise
' til the dawning of the final day
Frozen like a tiny hare i see him approaching from afar
he gathers me
Sorry sorry
Awed by his beautiful song Ralf turn that off
he gathers me up puts me in his basket
and as i fall asleep he continues on his rounds
Death i picture thus
this terrible tragedy cannot be undone
on the contrary it will forever be carved into the bark of our community as a dark day in the minds of all of us here in Borunda
Bloody hell
Christ
are you all right
Come on take my hand
do not you touch me
do not
do not touch me
our hometown pulls us in
but why is that
what forces lead us to return
that cause us to abandon the buzz of the city for the gentle burble of the brook
to that i respond
Explain the flight of the sparrow
Explain the gravity of the snail
no it is
Explain the gravity of the sparrow
Explain the flight of the snail
Explain the roar of the brook
Closeness awakens consideration and compassion
in our neighbour we see ourselves
we see the differences and acknowledge the similarities
Closeness becomes a bridge
in the small divide between us grows understanding and respect
a large gap generates questions alienation
our hometown provides freedom and demands accountability
it is forgiving and demanding

Calm down gentle
Listen to that
i have had that music on my mind all day
what are they singing
Erbarme erbarme dich
Mercy compassion
Sarah your mother's afraid
she is so afraid
she is panicking at the thought of losing her lovely eldest daughter
you must take pity on her
she finds it hard to accept that you are a young woman now
she wants to keep you with her
Your path is clear all you have to do is follow it
we are only passing through here
there is no reason to be afraid
Dad
are all pimps bad
the world depends on pimps and prostitutes
so
i suppose there must be a few good ones around
Good night dad
Sleep tight sweetheart

Leave me alone Vic
Piss off

it is over
Bastard
Goddammit
i understand you do not want to see me again
i came to say goodbye
You'd do better to avoid me

i can not be sure you won't land yourself in it anyway
you are not safe with me
would you ever harm me
I'd never harm you
Sarah let go of me
Let go of me forever
Sarah

he is full of tricks he protects no one
he doesn't give a damn about you
he is not interested in you at all
he is only interested in money
you are wrong
Look he refused to take these
he pushed me away because of you
you are a piece of shit to him
but he won't send you away
he never lets go of his prey he prostitutes it
for Christ's sake Sarah

Uncle Hugo do you know where Vic is

you mean like what do i do for a living or what are my hobbies or
no
i mean who are you
Well my name is Brooke Davis and i own a fashion line called Clothes over Bro's which before you read too much into it is very boy friendly just clothes friendlier
anyway i attended the orientation so i took the liberty of drawing up a statement of my financial worth i think you will be very pleased with
how old are you Brooke
Twenty two but i lead a rather accelerated lifestyle with the fashion line and the magazine and i did read somewhere that 25 is the average age for women to
do you own your own home
are you sexually active
Lately no but not for a lack of trying
Sorry
no
anyway as i said i have my financial statements and a copy of my medical history a copy of my birth certificate
and do you drink
Sorry
i noticed the bar
oh
some
not really
the bar is more for my roommate
and that would be Peyton Sawyer correct
you should see her knock them back she is a champ
i mean the boy that she loves recently almost married someone else and kind of went AWOL so unlike me who is perfectly stable and normal she is struggling a bit
i guess that is what happens when you fall in love
she can move out if it is a problem
my mom used to sing to me
i do not think i have ever really told anybody that before
it was like our little secret
but every night she'd come in and she'd tuck me in and she'd sing me something like lullabies or album rock stuff
and then i do not know after she was gone
i remember lying in bed for the first time and just feeling silence you know
and then realizing that for the rest of my life it was gone
all her songs were gone and her voice and the way it used to soothe me
Just all of it
so i guess i tried to find new songs to fill that quiet but none of them ever really have you know
now she is gone and Mia's gone and Luke is gone
there is just silence
there is just silence
you hear that
do i hear what
nothing
Silence
it is nice huh
i guess so
Luke you gotta get out of your head
it is been a month mate you gotta let it go
Let it go
a month ago i had my whole life ahead of me
second novel basketball team and a girl i was gonna spend the rest of my life with
Well you still have all those things yeah
if i did do you really think i would've spent the last four weeks at sea with you
which brings me to this what are you doing out here
what do you mean
Well i mean it is not like we haven't loved having you but it is time for you to get back to your life
and that all starts with a simple question
what do you want
i want my family back
and i want Haley to trust me again
i want her to look at me the way she used to and see a better man than maybe i will ever be
and then i wanna be that man
and i will be for her and for Jamie
i want to believe in Nathan again and i want to believe in the goodness of people
and i want my son to be safe and i want him to be great and i want that greatness to be seen and appreciated
that is what i want
i want to have a family
i want to use my success to help a child who maybe never really had a chance at all
i want to be a mom
and i am ready to be one i believe that
i want to believe in it all again music and art fate and love and i want to believe that i have made the right choices and that i am on the right path and there is still time to fix the mistakes i have made
and i guess i want hope
and i want Lucas
i want Lindsey
i want her to be my wife and i just wanna go back you know
Wanna go back to a month ago when we were happy and life had meaning and purpose and direction
that is what i want
Good
' Cause i have a way you can get all that
what did you write
something good i hope
Sorry it is just that i kind of feel like i am being judged so
you are not being judged Brooke you are being evaluated
it is to help clarify your reasons for wanting to adopt and to explore your capabilities maturity and emotional readiness
and does it take very long the whole decision making process
no
the home study is the last of it
so i will know if i am going to be a mom by the end of this meeting
Essentially yes
Wow
Well how am i doing
Let's talk about your past
my problems with my past are of my own doing
i am stubborn and i have a temper and i do not always make the best decisions
must have been very difficult for you coming so close to the NBA
do you think about that much
sometimes
yeah
i mean sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night and i walk through town past the school past the gym
i can still hear the echoes you know
you never told me that
it is not something i am all that proud of
it is like
Look i am not
i am not good at being vulnerable
in fact this is probably the closest i have come to it
Well the second closest
what is the first
when i was a junior in high school
i took some stuff to help me with my game
Drugs
and it was a stupid thing to do
i ended up collapsing on the court and my father was all about you know covering it up for the scouts
but anyway when i left the hospital i went to see Haley because i needed to know if she could forgive me
Wanted to see if i still had a chance to be great in her eyes
and what she did she forgave me
that was the moment that everything changed for me
that was the moment i fell in love with her
this girl who could see past all the mistakes i have made
i do not know
i guess maybe sometimes i screw up because i want to feel that again
Suppose that sounds pretty broken
you are not broken Luke
you might think that you are but
Hey you remember when i left your mom the first time to go back to New Zealand
it was one of the hardest things i have ever had to do
because i still loved your mom but i knew there was a place in her heart that i would never occupy a place reserved for someone else
Somehow i just could not get past that
this sounding familiar at all
yeah
yeah she said my heart was conflicted
Well here comes the good news
there was not a day while we were apart that i was not completely in love with your mom
and all it would've taken was for her to simply say
i love you i miss you and i need to be with you
i do not think it is that easy Andy
Lucas it is that easy
Lindsey needs to be convinced that you love her
and did i mention that i have a private jet and New York's not too far from here
Nah
i tried calling her Andy
she did not want to talk to me
all right tell me this much
has a day gone by since the wedding where you haven't thought about her or wanted to see her
Wanted her back
no
then you owe it to yourself to tell her that
you owe it to Lindsey too
Just trust me over time not knowing is way worse than to know
i think not knowing is the hardest part
Just not knowing what our marriage means to Nathan if he still wants the same things out of our relationship that i want if he still finds me sexy or if he still wants me or
how could you not know that
the name Carrie comes to mind
Why did not you just tell me about the flirting
i do not know
Did you like it
Maybe
Maybe i just needed it
Why because i do not flirt with you after a long day of wrestling with high school students and parenting our son
no
because you do not look at me like that anymore
and i get it you know
i haven't been worthy of that look from you in a long time
but God Haley i just
i miss that
when was the first time you felt a sense of accomplishment Nathan
it was
i started playing basketball
and the support of your father
when i started playing basketball
and this year all that stopped
all the praise and adoration
at least until your nanny started swimming naked
it is not the craziest case of transference i have ever heard
so what i need to start swimming naked for my husband's ego
no you do not
Haley this is not your fault
it is not
Why not swim naked
you could try it together might be fun
after all you are 22
Tell me something
when was the last time the two of you did something really young and foolish together
all due respect we have been married nearly six years we have a son who is almost five
we do not get to be young
everyone gets to be young especially when you are
Hey i am here about the car for sale
it runs great even though it is kind of old
my parents said i could finally get one
hi Max
hi buddy
okay for the first six months you are not to leave the state without notifying my office
you must have a job or show an attempt at gainful employment at least twice a week
any legitimate employment is normally acceptable
so running for mayor again doesn't count
you may obtain help with problems concerning employment residence finances or other issues that often trouble a person trying to adjust to life upon release from prison
Take a look at that
that is a good looking boy huh
that is Jamie
he is my grandson
you have kids
i am your case manager
this is not the View
i know
i just thought you might appreciate a little small talk
Get to know each other you know
there is no small talk
it is just i haven't spoken to too many people in a long time
at least none that i haven't paid to listen
this is the balance of what the state owes you for your work detail in prison
it will help you get situated
Count it sign for it and you can go 3 437
Seven hundred fifty bucks a year huh
and they say crime doesn't pay
How'd you like to make three grand for a little small talk
so anyway like i was saying
he is a great kid
Smart
he is got his whole life ahead of him
the other day he looks up at me and he says
they won't let me outside the fence
yeah trust me i know the feeling
can you really go to jail for not cleaning your room
Nah
but the guy next to me got 10 years for not eating his peas
i do not believe you
Good man
how is my favorite guy
okay
Except Uncle Lucas is gone
Well i get a feeling he will be coming back soon
Your parents they good
Daddy came back home but he mostly sleeps on the couch again like before
yeah
you know i miss you Jamie
i know
i miss you too
okay well i better get going before i start looking pervy
what is pervy
nothing you need to worry about
Go ahead and play i will see you again
okay
Bye Grandpa
Bye buddy
Hey
Remember
our secret
Hey kid
you see that little boy
you mess with him you answer to me you hear me
all right pass that around
Let's talk a little more about basketball Nathan
i find it interesting that when you describe yourselves you describe being parents and spouses and siblings and friends
but Nathan you never once described yourself as a basketball player
it is because i am not anymore
Why not
Well it sort of happens when your spine gets crushed
and the doctors definitively said you could not play
there is no such thing as definitively but nobody's ever come back from something like this before
but you are Nathan Scott
i am not that Nathan Scott
and Haley you never refer to yourself as a musician
yeah
yeah well i haven't recorded in a really long time
Why not
i had a son to raise and Nathan's accident
and now
now i still have a son to raise because i haven't found a really unattractive nanny yet
Look i am only as intelligent as the diplomas on my wall but here is a thought
Maybe you are not the people you fell in love with because neither of you is trying to be the people you fell in love with
do you think you are ready to be a mother Brooke
yes i do
Why
because sometimes all a child needs to succeed is love
Love from a parent who can provide a stable and caring environment and i can do that
and was your home life safe and caring
no
do you think you will ever get married
i do not know
if i met the right person i suppose i would
but you haven't met the right person yet
Owen the bartender
Bar manager
Chase Adams or Lucas Scott
Why did you close the store
how long you been home
a few months
and have you heard any new music
yeah a lot
did not get it at my store did you
oh okay i see
it is my fault
no it is no one's fault
i buy all my music online too you know it is just the way it is
yeah
but the store really was a lot more than that
i hope so
I'd like to think it had something to do with this cool new record label
this place is really awesome
it is like the Batcave in here
Tell me you fight crime at night like secretly in a leather catsuit
oh my God
Max you are the guy that lives at home huh
you think about him much
Lucas
every day
i do not understand what Lucas Scott has to do with my decision to adopt
you said Peyton was a mess because the boy she loves recently almost married someone else
you also had a relationship with him
oh we dated in high school
so what
so Lucas Scott falls in love with someone else
Peyton hits the bar and you decide to find love elsewhere
by adopting
Look i want to say this as politely as possible but that logic is awfully cynical not to mention completely wrong
it is just the timing seems a little questionable
Well i have been thinking about having a child since before i moved back to Tree Hill
and i know that i am young but i explained to you i have an accelerated life and on average most women have their first child at the age of 25
i looked it up
okay
Let's move on
any drug use
i do not use drugs
but in high school did not you run a campaign based on partying and promiscuity
i think this was around the time you were arrested for shoplifting
i am not who i was in high school
and you recently housed a drug addict named Rachel Gatina
i would never let my child do drugs
and i can not say that i know where you are getting all this information but i do not know how it affects my ability to be a good
you spoke to my mother
have you spoken with Peyton
not since the wedding
no
Jamie went missing then i had to deal with Dan and then we left
and the book
this whole Comet business that Lindsey was going on about at the altar
so Peyton drives a fricking Comet what the hell
i mean thank God the guy in the book did not see a white Bronco they'd all say i am in love with O J Man
what kind of car does Lindsey drive
oh that is not fair
it is not fair that you spoke with my mother
we always speak with applicants' families
i understand that but did mine tell you that she was just let go from my company
yes she did
Sour grapes do not you think
i think it is gotta be pretty busy for you in the absence of your CEO
i am really not that busy
that is 17 by the way
that is 17 phone calls this afternoon
a lot of them are emails
Brooke we ask our adoptive families to take at least six months off to smooth the transition for the new children
it is much easier in a two parent household
were you from a two parent household
my parents were divorced when i was 12
i am sorry to hear that
but some of the best people that i know are from single parent households
are you from a two parent household
something tells me you already know the answer to that
I'd like to hear it from you
i am from a no parent household
my father cared a lot more about his golf score than he ever did about me and my mom went heavy on the Scotch and Prada
the good news is that thanks to them
i know exactly what kind of parent i won't be
i won't be an absentee parent
if i have to sacrifice some things then so be it
that is noble Haley
but it also might be part of the problem
you both have individual passions individual gifts individual dreams and you should especially at your age
Maybe if you spent a little more time being selfish 22 year olds you might love yourself a bit more and resent each other a bit less
i do not resent Haley or Jamie
and they are the two best things that ever happened to me
yeah i agree with that
we are the best things that ever happened to him
no
i agree that Nathan and Jamie are the best and most important things that i have
what about music
i asked Nathan this before
what was it like hearing the cheers of enthusiastic sold out crowds every night
Incredible
it was humbling and wonderful
but it took you away from Nathan
yeah and we really struggled then
i mean i am not avoiding music now because i am afraid that is gonna happen again but
Good
Leaving Jamie out of all this would you say those were your best days
were you happiest with yourself
Well i was not proud of myself because i knew Nathan was hurting
but personally i guess i loved it yeah
what about you Nathan
Best days ever
Playing basketball in front of thousands
and the road trips sucked because i was away from Haley and Jamie but for me yeah
if you could have those days back do you think you might do things differently
Maybe treat each other a bit differently in the face of those dreams
yeah
Definitely
Maybe you can
Maybe you will
i wish i could change some of the things about how i have acted in the last couple months
i guess i am just disappointed in myself
you know i told Lucas that if he loved his fiance then i would learn to be okay with that because i wanted him to be happy but really i just wanted us to be happy me and him
oh and then when he did not marry her
i mean i felt terrible for her and for him you know
his heart is breaking right now and i come in here and i sit in silence and hear the echoes of who we used to be
and so i wish for patience and grace and the strength to just let him be happy
and mostly i pray for the strength to not make his life worse'cause of what i want
that is the toughest part
Letting go you know
that is the part of grace that really sucks
Today for Show and Tell i brought my bunny Chester
Chester's my best friend ever
my nanny Carrie used to be my best friend but she tried to put stuff in my hair and take me away
now i guess it is a tie between my Uncle Skills my Aunt Brooke and Chester
oh and my Grandpa Dan
he brought me home
you know how i got this scar Sam
i was helping my son Nathan
you see family is important to me
and did not you go to prison for killing your brother
i have changed
Come on people do not change
Take it from me most of the people who walk through that door walk right back into prison within a year's time
that is not gonna happen to me
Well we will see about that
Scott
i can not keep this
my debt to society is square
Donate it to charity
Evil for good right
Nice talk Sammy
this was not a good talk was it
i mean i did not pass did i
you are not gonna recommend me
no i am not going to recommend you for adoption Brooke
i am sorry but the truth is you are very young and you are single and i can not remember another case where an applicant's mother said She'd make a terrible candidate
Well it is too bad nobody interviewed her before she had a kid right
i am sorry we can not help you
you are not sorry but you should be
do you know what my mother said to me when i told her i wanted to start a company
she said Your chances are one in a million and i said Maybe i am that one and she said you are not
and she was wrong
and whatever she thought she saw in me was wrong
because i am one in a million and there is a child out there who has something so special inside of them but whose life is miserable because they think that nobody wants them
and i could be a great mother to that child no matter their age or race or sex
i could help them find what makes them special
and if you can not see that then you are wrong
Just like my mother
now why do not you go ahead and write that down
where is Mama
Hey sleepy head she will be back soon
how did you sleep
i had a dream about Daddy
oh yeah
Mmm hmm
and you were there
and you were sad but Daddy said everything's gonna be okay
it is all gonna be okay i know that
it is just some days are kind of messy you know
Well it is only life
at least according to Mia Catalano
you ever wonder where she'd be if you did not decide to start this label
she would be fine
Maybe not
you changed her life Peyton
so maybe that is why you came home
to change the life of the next artist or the one after that
Maybe change your own life at the same time
i think you are good here
you just need a little patience
Patience
Time heals old wounds huh
Time music
Let me ask you something
when is the last time you got in that cool car of yours turned up the stereo and just drove
you might try that sometime
Maybe find something there to heal that broken heart of yours
then again i am 36
Thirty six and still living at home yeah
so what the hell do i know right
Thanks
now we are nearly out of time so let's end this session as we have every week
Haley tell me some things you love about Nathan
i love that he is here with me every week without fail
and i love that he holds himself accountable for his mistakes and i love that he is so protective over me and Jamie
and i love that shirt that he is wearing
and maybe the way he wears it
Nathan
it is okay really
i am not that great at taking a compliment
oh well we will be working on that next week then
you two are going to be okay
i really think so
Thanks
can you pick up line 1 for me please
hi
i have been traveling with my mom since
yeah i talked to Haley
i am glad Jamie's okay
yeah
Look i know i owe you this but i am not going to publish it
Luke
Look i know you promised your boss a second book out of me but i can not
you have to
they will void your deal they will make you pay back your advance and on top of that it is too good not to publish
i miss you
i do
Lindsey i love you
every day i wake up and i have this ache in my chest
and sometimes i just sleep in because i know when i wake up you are not gonna be there
i love you too Luke you know that
but i can not be with you
it is okay
i will publish the book if you edit it
Luke
that is it that is my offer
there will be long nights heated arguments
it will be like we are married
i will edit the book because i believe in it
and i believe in you
but we can not be together
we will be
one of these days you are gonna wake up and you will feel that same need in your heart and you are gonna realize how much i love you
and whenever that day is i will still be waiting for you
and you will come home to me
hi
hi buddy
it is quiet around here without Jamie
yeah
he is with Brooke
Baby steps
yeah
how are you sleeping these days
so so
Jamie tosses around like a Tasmanian devil
he should probably get back to his own bed soon
the separation thing
or he could sleep in the spare bedroom with me
you know sometimes i find your goodness staggering
i did not get a chance to tell you in the session but your kindness is overwhelming Haley
you saved my life
i haven't said it lately you are also sexy as hell
Hey i was thinking not sleeping in this bed might not be so bad tonight if you wanted to try it with me
you got any more of that sexy talk
what the kindness stuff or the sexy stuff
Sexy
you have a serious ass Haley James
Make a wish place it in your heart
anything you want
everything you want
do you have it
Good
now believe it can come true
you never know where the next miracle's gonna come from the next smile
the next wish come true
but if you believe that it is right around the corner and you open your heart and mind to the possibility of it to the certainty of it
you just might get the thing you are wishing for
the world is full of magic you just have to believe in it
so make your wish
do you have it
Good
now believe in it
with all your heart
English SDHWell friends my wife's waiting
my dad believes it won't last longer than a few months
we won't intrude for very long Herr iek
it is terrible David
we must be hopeful
Herr iek
there is jewelry in my dad's study
you know where
Just in case
do you need some help
hi
this is Mr imek
the younger Mr Wiener imek
he is my neighbor Franta
he is a good man
something small for the journey
Well good bye
we are very sorry
it is not your fault
Aunt Frieda wrote that it is okay in Theresienstadt
Children go to school
there is an orchestra food even hot water
Maybe better than squeezing in the kids' room here eh
we just do not know why she mentioned Uncle Otto's cough
we are all getting sick now
it is just that Uncle Otto's been dead for 1 5 years
Good luck
Alik
Come here
Herr imek
oh my God
Mr Wiener what are you doing here
i need help
if somebody sees you they will execute the whole street
i do not have a choice
i have to hide
Good God
Get out of here
we have children
Jew
AJew is here
AJew is here
Help
DlVI DED WE FALL
can not those bastards be quiet
Bastard means a child out of wedlock and these are our neighbors' children
Exactly
i do not know what drives people to keep breeding and multiplying
must be some twisted self preservation instinct
Even if you could have a child you know
i still would not bring it into this world
but it is not like that
oh please do not believe in miracles
do not pray to her for a kid
i do not pray to her
oh you do
i do not
then pray
do not you think i know you
you always get that holy expression
Your eyes get moist and then things start happening inside
you are nuts
Well and now 7our Nazi friend is here
United we stand
my friends good morning
God damn your jokes
i have got something for you
Good morning ladies and gentlemen
i have a surprise for you
shall we have some real coffee Josef
you should not have
you can not tell me what i should and should not do
if i can i give
i was never stingy
by the way Josef i arranged papers allowing you to drive
Thank him
Thank you Mr Prohaska
Horst
you are in a good mood today are not you
Why not
do not trust London Josef
Hey i see through you Boss
Relax
i am not petty and i was in the Patriots' Club
Come madam
have a look
Josef you are not interested
but of course
do not say a thing
Your head is full of Stalingrad and the never ending siege of Leningrad right
i will straighten out 7our errors and illusions
Imagine this is Moscow
These are our armies on the eastern front
the retreat back to Rzhev and Vyazma was a brilliant move by our offensive headquarters understand
they created an amazing maneuvering space right
and as spring follows winter the Fhrer renews his forces
and he will pound this space with all his crushing might
and by the by it is about 250 divisions
and not only German
and Bolshevism will suffer at the hands of Hungarians
Italians Spanish volunteers from France and Belgium and even the Slovaks
Cigarette
i would not deprive you of 1 5 crowns
Well actually 20
incidentally a new family is moving into Wiener's villa tomorrow
the house has been cleaned and sterilized
it could be worse
so tomorrow they are moving into Wiener's villa
i hope you are not going to keep on pitying them
he was not just our employer
he was also our acquaintance was not he
Careful
he was your superior and you were my superior
that is all
Today my superior is Herr Kepke
okay but he was a decent man was not he
he did things for you too did not he
Look you can not expect me to show sympathy to some Yid or any other enemy of the Reich
Come and have a look madam at this husband of yours
he used to be the energetic boss of the sales department
and now he is sitting here like this sipping coffee
Maybe you'd better start working before they notice
Maybe you all might have found out that while building the border fortifications a transom fell and broke my leg in three places
so for your information that means i am disabled
i know a loser a hero
i almost forgot
Look at this
Perfect work
our Leni embroidered this
is not she clever
she said it was for the uncle who always sleeps
i have one just like it but
i never have time to use it so much work
what are you pretending to be
Why you you sleepyhead
and you laugh
Come lie down
Lie here and rot
you are also a hero
Goddamn it
this
you have it in your pocket
Let me see
Come on
i am not a child
what about my head
Wear this cap
i look like a beetle
but it suits you
it doesn't really matter does it
is that good bye
no
it is risky is not it
and all of a sudden we understand each other
Just a hint is enough for me
so do not go
who is making you
Haven't we done enough for them
who knows if they will ever come back
Let me
oh please
Please i can tie my own shoelaces huh
i can not leave them to those Nazis
Understand
i made a promise and i need to keep it
it works
Mr iek
David
can you take the light out of my eyes
what are you doing here
i escaped from Poland
i needed something valuable
but you can not stay here
i am off tomorrow night
but you do not understand
you can not stay for even a minute
Germans are coming tomorrow morning
and with you
where with us
oh you mean at our place
God what are you doing here
i was afraid
Come on
Let's go
who is it
Good evening Mrs Marie
David
Let's go
what is that
i shit my pants
Turn it off
Take my hand
you want some jam on it
Close the door
i am
you know this is no longer exactly a safe area
a safe place
it is full of collaborators and finks
you would not believe what abnormal times can do to normal people
the swine
i would
what about your family
i do not know
they are probably dead
you wrote that conditions in Theresienstadt were okay
no one could write the truth from there
it is just a transfer station to the camps in Poland and nobody there is supposed to survive
Nobody at all
i was lucky to work where they sort confiscated goods
Clothes and valuables
and after 1 8 months i was able to bribe one of the SS men
two of us escaped
and what do you plan to do here
i lived here all my life so i thought maybe someone here might help me
but what are you going to do now
Tomorrow i am meeting a friend at a set place out of town
i promised to get some money and then we will move on
Well i will give you a lift there
i have papers
and i have a car borrowed from an ex coworker
he worked in your warehouse
before the war
Obviously
Maybe your friend waited somewhere else
no
they probably got him
i will go on myself
you go back
Thank your wife again
Maybe he will still come
something might have kept him
Maybe
Halt
Come here
oh my God
Good morning

we must be careful
Good heavens
that is mine
Let go
Thanks a lot
i know how risky it is for you
this is for you
what is it
oh no
David you are not serious
Keep them
Come on
Let's go
Go go
you are afraid are not you
before the war many people had these made
they suspected what was to come and made these shelters
now they are used as safes or pantries
i even helped to make the one at your father's
Below here are the stairs
you can hear what is happening in the house
and here bars were torn out
now it leads to the rain gutter
here is a mattress
Heat will come in from the next room
the pig must go
i will take care of it
at night you can come out if you want okay
Well we will have to see
but he has to wash himself doesn't he
yeah but mainly he has to be quiet
if something happens scratch softly
like a mouse okay
here are some blankets and a kerosene lamp
Good night
Good night
i will bring you a warmer blanket
David
Good night
we have to do something immediately
about what
about getting rid of this problem
we have to eat it
we will simply eat it right
oh God
but what about him
what
do you want to send him away
Come on
Want
do not want
does it depend on what i want
could i have imagined I'd be left out of all this
we watched from the window and told ourselves it was just passing by
Today it is after us
i expected something like this but i am still shaken up
Look nothing changes if you send him away
they catch him around the first corner and then they will find out he was here
that he was here and that you did not report him
so what are you saying
that makes it easier then
you want to turn him in
what
you want to report him
oh please really Marie
you decided for him for you for me and for everyone on this street
and are you blaming me or what
no
i am not blaming you
it is just good that we have no children
you are so right
what an awful smell
it is soap
it is really waking me up
he has to help us with it
you think he'd allow pork past his lips
in the circumstances he should eat what he gets
oh it was hard and risky work getting it here
Hands up
That'd surprise you eh
what an idiot
Josef you are asking for trouble
what is all this
Marie you can smell these shenanigans down the street
you are asking to be searched
Show me
it is not tough yet just like the times themselves
but they will be
my hat please
i hope you did not get my car all greasy
Josef you are really asking for trouble
and what are you going to do with it
we will eat some
you can have some
something i will take
something i will give
Marie come have a look
Look at this beauty
where did you get it
we confiscated it yesterday
they won't need it anymore
and here it will add a certain flair
so have you decided
the position with us is still open
i feel so good here with you
Josef always had class
he knew how to live
and he got me the job at the warehouse right
TheJew Wiener was stingy but good during the crisis
i fed three kids
Bastards
now they are used to it and can imagine nothing else
Josef do you still remember the boy that everyone called
Wurst instead of Horst
you know Wurst like sausage
i know what wurst means
Wurst fetch me a beer
Get out of here Wurst
Back to the Reich
Back where
my home is here
you mean with us
Certainly
Josef accepted me almost like a son
he sent all those jokers packing
by the way is there any beer
no
Come on
Accept
did not accept
that was long ago
i can remember once
Today we all just laugh about it
Today i have simply accepted you
we need to help each other
i was in trouble yesterday
Tomorrow it might be you
Especially if you treat the law on hoarding like you do
That'd mean prison Marie
but it is delicious
nothing will be forgotten
Hey cut it out
Kindly stop it
See how he stares at me
do not stare
Please Wurs Horst
Thanks
i have had enough
you think i do not notice how some people avoid me
how they cross to the other side of the street
that is their business
what have i done to them
to anybody
i am helping decent people
is that a sin
no it is not a sin
Everybody just talks about helping gabs and gabs
this means helping to me
so you are actually a hero
what do you mean hero
who would be foolish enough today to act like a hero
what about you
you sit here either stuffing yourself with pork or wallowing on the couch
we have to survive
every lovely thing should survive be saved eh
what are you doing here
you have to come home Dad
Herr Kepke is waiting
is that how you knock on the door of nice people
Idiot
this is Karl
Say hello
Good afternoon
Good afternoon
i delivered him with my own hands
Wait outside
Get rid of everything
Properly
People are pigs
you might be turned in and what could i do about it
to be safe skin a rabbit to be able to show the bones
since we are in this situation we must follow certain rules
he drops by whenever he wants
do you understand
Please
Well what
he comes by to see you
i am just an excuse
Well deprive him of it
Take that job he is always offering
oh Marie it is not
you think i
i should
what
do you know where 7ou're pushing me
what is that look
do you know what you are asking
you brought David here so do what you have to do
what are you doing
Why are you setting it there
we agreed on some rules right
and you are playing restaurant here
Take it to him there immediately
Rules will be observed
Take it to him there
this is not a roadside inn for fugitives
but it is dark outside and it is locked
he can not be locked in that hole day and night
Give them to me
Listen
there is nowhere dark enough to hide us darling eh
so take it and bring it to him there
Go
Josef please
Please
do not say please
Go
Why are you pushing me
Sorry
Wish him bon apptit
Goddamn it
Thank you
you are welcome
Your husband is right
i know
but it is one thing to be right and another to be able to stand such things
do you need anything
are not you cold here
Did you finish the book
i can not read much
are you thinking about what happened to your family
Kaje my sister could have saved herself at least for a while
after arriving at the camp she was offered to be a kapo
provided she'd be hard enough
she was given a club
and told to beat our parents to death
i could see my father and mother kneeling there begging her to do it
Come
Nice
i haven't seen your wife for a long time
how is she
oh yeah
she is started studying French
with whom
what
who is she taking lessons from
by herself
by herself
Well when such a beautiful woman has no kids she never knows what to do with herself
she is been ill a lot lately
i never see her
no no Josef
you can not refuse medicine
Well thanks then
Just take it
i know a good doctor
you could go to him
Confidential information
they are sniffing everywhere
they no longer trust anyone
anything can be an excuse
that some Czech starts with French before knowing German
oh come on do not underestimate it
you also need to train 7our facial expression
the Germans read faces
they are excellent typologists
every day you must practice that irreproachable loyal expression
it is easy for you
you were born with it
no i was not
Try it
Relax the muscles
now
now i do not know what 7ou're thinking about at all
Neither do i
do not laugh
this was my son Andreas' favorite composition
the one who fell a hero at the defense of Kharkov
Go to your room Willy
you know gentlemen of course it saddens me greatly
but pride is stronger
and i am aware of the significance for us of the loss of a single young German life
Lately i read a fascinating article about this
Somebody exactly calculated that the life of one German a soldier is worth 20 Slavs and 1 00 Jews
a hundred
yes
i brought you something
Vitamins and a sunlamp
a big empty house and 7ou're stuck in this hole huh
i feel so sorry about it
i am afraid our neighbors will figure something out
i do not trust anyone anymore and them least of all
i have no one to speak to anymore
it is enough to speak to you sometimes
Thanks to that i can stand it
me too
we just have a bigger and lighter cell
what is it
do you need anything
Well i think i caught a cold
that is too bad
here is a pillow
Well good night
so that old Kepke is not a bad boss eh
' Night
what about Marie
she is alone all day
Perhaps a visit from me would cheer her up
Like i said she doesn't feel well Horst
'Night
i am in Paris
i visit the museums
the Louvre is very nice
i visit it three times
you must be crazy
i thought you were sleeping
Did you get the medicine
of course but Prohaska walked me all the way here
what if he'd come up
you once called him a snoop did not you
Horst
Careful about darkening the windows Josef
' Night
i just do not want you going in there when i am not home
he is not well
so give him another blanket
i already did
i gave him a fur coat and the sunlamp
what
what
my sun
i do not feel well either and you give him my sun
Go to bed
i will make you some tea
if there is any left
do not you want to wall him in there so you can relax
Josef he is really sick
Exactly
you might catch something from him
what are you doing
i am going to sleep here in case he needs anything
no i am sleeping on the couch
Go to bed
do not worry
i will stick a slipper in the door
you are such a
this life is for shit
Good night
i stand beneath the carob tree
and it is not easy
i sit beneath the fig tree
and all is green and free
i lie beneath the almond tree
and it is like a dream
my gorilla
has a villa in the zoo
my gorilla
Lives contentedly and true
he can not speak of politics
but if his wife has got the itch he can scratch it
Good afternoon
Agata come on home
i need to buy a briefcase
Thank you
Excuse me
Gestapo Marie
Cut it out you fool
hi
we have visitors
Josef please
Josef come here
Please
i need to buy a briefcase
yes
what do you mean yes you fool
Sit down Herr Kepke
Marie you look terrible
is not the medicine working
you must excuse me
the old man's middle son got killed
to Paul
do not give him any more
he is had enough
he should speak German if that is his native tongue
i am sorry
Well then to the hero Paul
do not you say Paul's name
Josef
Please
Josef
Please
who is calling us from here
who is that calling like that
Why do not you air the room a bit Marie
Let it go
my Paul
this is your fault too
have you tried compresses on your chest
Careful you do not catch something
People like me rarely catch anything
i am Nordic
Nordic race
Marie maybe the time will come when from the union of people like you and me
what are you afraid of
that time and that human may be closer than you think
Well Marie let's not fight about it
Josef your wife is burning up
Come and see
my gorilla
has a villa in the zoo
Bye bye
you are Czechs
you should be ashamedShh
Sync corrections by honeybunny www addic7ed com
so Mort you ordered a small
how small was it

Sorry i am taking a stand up comedy class
i think i did something wrong
i thought it was funny
Ugh the ice cream machine's stuck again
Hey Mort you are getting a free medium a free large a free extra large
oh
you got to hit it just right Dad
i said just right
okay kids only one thing to do ice cream for brunch
TEDDY
Yay
yeah all right
Yay free ice cream
yeah
Let's just unplug it
Reach behind there and grab the plug
i found my retainer
LlNDA
you do not wear a retainer
oh God you are right
Get it out of my mouth
never mind i got it
Aw
door opens bell jingles
hi Hugo hope you are not here for ice cream
i am lactose intolerant Linda
oh
i am also intolerant of that suspicious looking bicycle outside Bob
uh why are you telling me
Maybe it is because you are the block captain
but you do not even live on this block
Well i live in the quadrant and i happen to be the quadrant captain
Quadrant captain did you make that up
Did i make up these quadrant captain business cards
Why would you do that
i did not actually mean to
Well pick them up
no now stand down
that bike has been there for 24 hours and the seat's missing
it is clearly abandoned
Fine i will take care of it
do not be block cocky Bob just do it
Jerk
GENE
Nailed him
you trying to steal my bike
no someone thought it was um
it is mine
Want to see the receipt
farts
that is not a receipt
where do you shop
i really thought being block captain would be more fun
like I'd have a gun or a Taser or something
all i get is this whistle
do not knock the whistle
Whistles stop hundreds of crimes every year
and thousands of basketball plays
and they make dolphins jump out of the water and eat fish
Dad you could do that
Bob i recall you raise either chinchillas or children
which is it
uh children
Good
i am focus testing some ideas
i need a new blockbuster attraction at Wonder Wharf
Why do not you focus test with the kids down at Wonder Wharf
those sheep
i have already got their money
besides these children are a perfect cross section of American youth
yeah boy girl and Tina
i am a tastemaker
when i talk people listen
Guys
Mr Fischoeder we are adrenaline junkies

the Deepening 3

Right
the Deepening 3D eeepening

Let's run it past the focus group
Five holer nostrils too
Sounds like a winner
Noooo

I'd like to thank the jackass who got the left handed scissors

LlNDA

Wow she is good with that thing

sighs
and so it begins
Why are we watching a movie about a fake shark when we could be at Wonder Wharf standing next to the real fake shark
because this is how i want to remember the shark in its prime scaring the crap out of Linda Blair
Fischoeder is crazy to keep that thing going
after what happened to that girl's arm and that lady's poor dog and that guy's balls you know the juggler
oh yeah
Fischoeder's crazy to keep it going with all those people lining up paying to see it buying souvenirs
nothing good can come from that shark
it is evil
oh there i am again
that is me in the red white and blue trunks
what is everybody looking at
nothing
nothing
Your body

Topless car wash
yes
Tina no
Nude hot tub no
yes
oh okay here is some good clean shark
no
See that surfer getting eaten
i made out with her
she had her movie makeup on
Fake organs were coming out of her side
Pretty weird
The'80s am i right
you are not wrong
Why is the shark attacking that submarine
the ClA is training sharks to attack Soviet subs and they are holding the shark's baby hostage in the nude hot tub
so the shark is not bad she is just protecting her baby
she is misunderstood
she just needs a friend
soulful'80s era pop ballad melody playing
deep belching
it doesn't want to be here
this is exploitation
i will show you exploitation
Go up there and get me that fin
you want her fin
i have got a guy
he wants it packed in ice and on the next plane
Why does he want a mechanical shark fin
Mechanical shark fin soup
Mmm that does sound good
do not cut off her fin
it is her best feature
God Tina it will grow back
oh yeah cut it off
i am bare backing a shark
Come on Gene chop chop with the chop chop
Whoa it is tippy
Aah no Gene get the fin

Bob there is some kind of commotion down at the Wonder Wharf
it is like the Running of the Bulls but dumber
yeah but with a shark
uh yeah it is a shark

FlSCHOEDER
nothing to worry about
Having a little shark problem
uh good time to grab a hot dog or some popcorn

Mr Fischoeder enough's enough right
you have got to shut off the shark right
i mean now
Shut it off
oh no no i have got a packed park
i can not shut down my top attraction
i mean i really can not
that thing's on till it runs out of gas
but what if it breaks out of Wonder Wharf
what happens then
those are reinforced cement walls Bob built by somebody proud immigrants i guess i do not
Wha
the shark fell over
that is crazy
we were at the library right guys
yeah exploring the wonderful world of books and periodicals

this is my fault
i have to do something
what
i said this is my fault
i have to do something
oh
Block Captain Bob
yeah
blowing weakly
God
on Ocean Avenue local merchants fear they will become so much fish food while police and fire officials are caught in a surf and turf battle
meanwhile local citizens are taking matters into their own hands
the block captain has called an emergency all block shark stopping meeting crashing
EDlTH
that shark is ruining my arts and crafts business
this town might do all right without arts but crafts

Thank you
i have to run
N no i said it might be cool to get a mechanical shark
i did not turn it loose
yes he did
no i did not
Nobody knows who did
yeah stop this insane witch hunt
it could've been anyone who was not at the library
the library
it is no use
they know we knocked the shark over
Wait what
you did
no
that is just an expression
Hey did you knock over the shark today
you know i did
you are the family from hell
they are destroying the town
Let's have a town meeting to decide what to do with the Belchers

Let's put our heads together right
Block captain brainstorm

Go
Topless car wash like in the movie
Topless car

uh Linda said there were no bad ideas Bob
Well she was wrong Hugo
muttering
yes like when she married you
what
what
i heard you mutter something
yes and when someone mutters that means they are muttering to themself
muttering
Huge mistake
Well i heard you
what
i heard you mutter
oh really
what did i say
Linda made a huge mistake
so we agree
Ha ha
someone else
Listen to me
i know how the shark thinks
it is confused
it doesn't know why you want to kill it
it just wants to go home
Tina it is a machine
it is dumber than our toaster
our toaster is also confused
it doesn't know why we put bagels in it
oh my God
okay we got four good ideas
Well four Hail Marys we could try
chants
Let's stop the shark
or not
ALL
Let's stop the shark
or not
Let's stop the shark
or not
mechanical whirring metal clanging
if a spike strip can stop those drunk Shriners it should be able to stop a shark
here it comes
here it comes
Ouch
okay we have given the shark spikes
i knew that would happen
BOB
that oil's gonna keep the shark from getting any traction
Ah
and we made it faster
Bravo Bob
you want to catch a fish you gotta think like a fisherman right
okay now the shark is electrified
all you are doing is making the shark more dangerous Bob
i can see that Hugo
it was an FYl
Bob the shark's getting pretty close to our restaurant
it is all right
we have saved the best idea for last the big hole
Why'd we save our best idea for last
because we did not know it was the best idea until the other ideas were really terrible
Stupid
anyway we dig a big hole the shark falls in and hopefully end of our problems
Beginning of China's problems
Sorry China
they will nail it
they are really smart
LlNDA
Come on keep going
Climb into your hole you big mouse
quietly
Turn around

Gone but not forgotten
Wait what are we talking about again
Maybe you are not such a horrible greasy perverted shabby two bit filthy disgusting pig

rumbling

dramatic musical sting
Dad can we keep it
the shark is in our basement
Well there is only one way to find out for sure
Kids stay here
Duh

Whoa Teddy calm down

Shark boss
chomping noises
i am blacking out Bobby

we have tried everything
it is too bad we can not make it die from cancer
like in the movie
it did not die from cancer Teddy
oh no you are right
they shot the cancer ending but it tested really bad
it did not have the pow
Really
Cancer
no pow
yeah they shot a whole new ending remember
they went and poured wet cement down its throat
yeah and that would be really helpful if we had a cement mixer
door bell tinkling Maybe we do
the ice cream machine
she is right
we could fill up the shark with ice cream
that might mess it up right
i chose you Dad

i always sell doors 100 each windows and bumpers 100 each
Just one price so i do not mix'em up
OK
the price is more than reasonable at least it seems to me
Say you make it 300 and i haul the stuff away myself
i will need a trailer for the four doors
you have got 600 or 700 worth of stock
Four doors at 100 each
they are not worth much
a Coronet
they are not worth much to you cause you have found them
a guy who needs'em who scrapped his door and needs another 100 he is laughing
Same for a fender or a bumper or rear window
i make everybody happy
i will think it over

i spend a buck to buy something
Cars
Cars one after the other
it is ideal here for withdrawing from society
yeah it is quiet
you always feel healthy you are never sick
there is nobody to bother you you are at the end of the road
it is Ideal to enjoy peace and quiet and have time to plan your evenings

Marginal
yes
there is nobody like me no one who can do the work i do
it is good for everybody
it is
i am the only one
who does it this way Others use electricity or by fire
i do everything by hand always
you do not care what other people think of you
about what you do
Ever since i started people say you are crazy to do this
so i have come to realize it is true that i am crazy but it is nice being crazy like this
because if they were in my shoes they'd see
i am not that crazy
but looking at me from outside they figure it is ridiculous
that is how it is
for me it is not crazy it is a good life that thay can not know what it is like

it smells good like smoke
i made a fire this morning
with logs and some maple
Maple boards
you are always healthy
Always
the secret is to work
you can not stop
Same with me i am always workingi spokend to a professional person who has told me that what was happening to me was what they described as a pre meltdown penultimate
this are perhaps the last haunting words of director Damien Cockburn the director of the film Tropic Thunder a film that like a cinematic Titanic was doomed to sink taking with it it is cast and crew before it even come ashore on the shores of the American cinema
War a theme that has inspired countless directors and Hollywood productions
but what is war
what is it mean to take another man's life
War is murder or institutionalized genocide
what is it in our nature that compels perfectly rational human beings to kill one another
it turns
and action
None of these questions interested me
what interests me is making a documentary about making of a film that led to it is on unmaking
Los Angeles California 2008
hello
i am documentary filmmaker Jan Jrgen
for many years i have been fascinated by the most magicalist of all places Hollywood
as a boy growing up in Wiesbaden Germany
i would go to the cinema and marvel at the larger than life filmgods on the silver screen
Mark Hamil James Garner and of course Barbara Hershey
but i also remember thinking to myself
is there are a more forbidding sinister side to Hollywood
than the lies perpetueted by the studio system
of course these are the questions of a child
but that question still lingers to this day
last year i was ask to document the making of a Vietnam war classic called Tropic Thunder
what you are about to see is it unflinchingly as possible a look at the making of a Hollywood nightmare
my nightmare
Tropic Thunder
in the fall of 2007 the renowned Broadway theater director Damien Cockburn was shooting one of the most expensive Vietnam war movie ever made
Roll camera please
Costing well over 300 million and filming on location in Vietnam
Tropic Thunder boasted one of the most unlikely cast of all time
do not fucking whine
what do you think i am a dick
Cracking under the pressure of a blockbuster filmmaking
Damien and his cast suddenly and misteriously disappeared
Rumors abundant about the whereabouts of actors Tugg Speedman and Jeff Portnoy
Studio's head Les Grossman refuses to finance aditional search effort saying quote
i spend all the money i am going to spend on this film
but what actually happened to the cast and crew of Tropic Thunder
to answer these questions we must take a journey not just in the heart of the conflict that was the Vietnam War but also a journey into madness
in 2005 Damien purchased the rights to an obscure memoir called Tropic Thunder written by retired army sergeant and Vietnam veteran
John Four Leaf Tayback
Four Leaf named such because of it is incredible luck in battle was the platoon sergeant of an elite handpicked group of soldiers code named
Tropic Thunder
Sent on suicide mission behind enemy lines the men of Tropic Thunder never returned
however Four Leaf miraculously survived and single handedly completed the mission
but in the process he lost every single hand
the studio director Les Grossman chairman and ClO of ImagiCorp sensing commercial success snapd up the auction of the script
he wanted to go in the production immediately
Virtually overnight
Grossman lavished over 140 million american dollar on the film
Flushed with cash Damien's confidence seemed to grow exponentially in proportion with the new budget
how would you describe yourself directorially
i often get asked this question and the most succint way to describe myself
50 Werner Herzog 50 Hal Ashby and 50 Peter Bogdanovich
yes but that is 150
yes i guess it is
with set built and the crew in place Damien began casting the film
the first actor to be cast was the reclusiv australian Method actor and notorious bad boy from down under Kirk Lazarus
no doubt because of his award cache Grossman offered him the lead
every day than i wake up i thank my father for being an abusive alcoholic
because it was that exact kind of environment that i find makes great talent
Lazarus total commitment on past roles had been borderlined unnerving
while in Ireland preparing to play the gay priest in Satan's Alley he was once found circumcising an adult male behind a pub in Belfast
however Lazarus who have claimed that was no acting challenges left for him shunned the part of Four Leaf and insisted instead to play the black sergeant
Lincoln Osiris
in preparation Lazarus went to extraordinary and controversial lengths when he had his skin surgically altered in a Singapore clinic
the results however were simply astonishing
he was a true carbon copy of the original man
during pre production we visited him on several occasions
never once did he droped caracter
but you got to walk a mile in a man shoes
Thats what i did
i walked a mile in shoes thats right
now this are 1977 sneakers
that is what you gotta do
there is a myriad of black actors we could cast but that is what people do
who else are you thinking
the list is endless
Denzel Washington
Sydney Poitier
i could go on
Damien seemed blind to the pitfalls of casting a white actor to play the part of an African American
we talked about whether if it was racist or not
we came to the conclusion that it definitely not racist so that was reassuring
the race no longer an issue
Lazarus demanded that the actual family of the real Sergeant Osiris flewn from Galveston Texas all the way to Vietnam
his commitment to the role was breathtaking
it is working
it is working
Back in L a Les Grossman and his producer Rob Slolom continued their search for the role of Four Leaf
Smelling a bargain their top choice was action colossus Tugg Speedman
Speedman Scorcher franchise grossed over 3 4 billion worlwide
however Speedman's fee which used to be 25 million dollars of picture had fallen sharply just under five million
here we go again
Again
the reason
several failed atempt to expend his appeal to audiences
Simple Jack the story of an intellectually challenged horsewhisperer was a nauseating and cloying atempt not just to win awards but also respect in Hollywood
i like when we touch heads
he desperately needed to revive his anemic career
Wake up Pom Pom
many people questioned whether Speedman had the intelligence to tackle the complexity of such a role
you have been casted for the role of Four Leaf
what is it about this american hero that made you so desperat to play this role
it is an interesting exploration of the american thing
one more question
Thank you
who do you think grey your hair for the role
Speedman got the part
the next role to be cast was the part of Fats
Again Grossman inserted himself in the process by inexplicably casting celebrity trainwreck and known drug addict Jeff Portnoy
a man child who had made millions on its ability to make himself fart on command
Gross
Portnoy first become known to the American audiances in his hit television series
Heat Vision and Jack where he played a maverick genius astronaut whose best friend was a talking motorcycle
Knowledge is power
for real
his fame went global when he began starring in a string of pre pubescent teenage fart comedys such as Fart Club and his flagship franchise
the Fatties
Portnoy frequent and dazzling public meltdowns did not seem to matter one bit
Fix it fucking dope
his run ins with the law drunk driving convictions and his continued intravenous drug problems made him a risk
he was virtually uninsurable
Damien obviously devastated by Grossman hideos casting choices seemed determined to remain optimistic
we got a lot'em
we got little Timid
we got Commando
there is also Holly Go Lightly
i am sitting up wind
i am sorry about that
no but the wind
sometimes changes direction
Let me go this way
yeah but it still looping around hitting me in the face
in their search for guaranteed box office success the ImagiCorp nonsensical casting choices continued
i was puzzled yet again when i overheard Damien bragging about casting Al Pacino for the role of Motown the black 19 year old from Detroit
i later learned that they were casting the rapper Alpa Chino singer of the hit single i Love Tha Pussy
Say hello to my little friend
in his contract with the ImagiCorp he was also promised product placement in the film for his line Bust a Nut energy bars and Booty Sweat energy drinks
i work with Tugg Speedman
i love'em
Thank you Les Grossman for giving me the job
with Mr Chino now playing Motown there was just one person left to cast
Brooklyn
Snatching the role was a complete unknown
Kevin Sandusky
his only credit to date was a surprisingly touching pharmaceutical commercial for a teenage erectyl dysfunction medication called Prom Night
Five days away from the first day of shooting and with his platoon finally in place Damien frustrations began to mount
to encourage realism and close bond with the actors
Damien arranged for a 5 day survival boot camp with Gulf War veteran Drake the Stick Longwood
Sadly only Sandusky was eager to attend
Jesus fuck
oh fuck
Sorry
Sorry Damien i am sorry
you better be fucking sorry because you are fucking dead
Get down and give me fucking 50
can i take a break
Get down motherfucker and do it
do what he says
who the fuck are you
i am the director
oh no
my God
Damn
the boot camp experience itself seemed to be an omen of things to came
Finally the first day of filming had arrived
Damien spent the whole night prying putting the finishing touches on the script
he arrived on the set in fantastic spirit
the choppers had landed the effects team was in place the camera was ready
everything was going willingly
everything except for the actors
Lazarus refused even to acknowledge Damien's presence unless he was wearing fatigues
Sandusky perhaps traumatized by the boot camp was acting erratic
Alpa Chino refused to leave us alone believing we were a crew from MTV
that is MTV
no
we just
yeah
Yo we going to do a small show agree
Check this out
Yours boy Alpa Chino doin' it real big
we are doing the same
Deal every day on my new movie Tropic Thunder you know how we do it baby
he continually heckted us looking for free publicity
Damn Booty Sweat from Alpa Chino on sale soon
and Portnoy sadly was clearly and actively still abusing narcotics
you go and get'em
Worst of all
Speedman was yet to even step a foot outside his trailer
Work came to a virtual standstill
Finally Damien was pressed to do something about it
it is a fuck it is a cunt
Fucking 200 000 dollars fucking breakfast
this is ain't gonna be pretty
Hey
what is coming on
nothing just dropping by to make sure the captain is shipshape
what is that
Desperate Housewives
Allright
you ever seen this show
i know i heard about it
it is fucking awesome
oh yeah
my girlfriend got me hooked
are you ready
Kind of
i be right out
OK
and get me the seasons from Desperate Housewives
are you sure
yes i am hooked
OK
i only watching two minutes
and i am friggin hooked
you will hate me
i will hate you if you do not show up on the set
yeah
Fuck
yeah
i think that
as David said to Goliath
i think we understand each other
oh hey
are you
they
the Survivor is here
the season one
Call me if you want season 2
do not hate me
i do not
Come here
Just like Big Brother or something
after several hours of waiting
Speedman finally emerged to commence work
Keep rolling and go
however when the cameras rolled it became apparent that he yet to learn any of his lines
to all present it was clear that the press on would be madness
Lazarus seemed to be at breaking point
we gonna be here all day all lookin' at you fucked up again
Allright hotshot
by 4 o'clock Speedman had cost to production 1 6 million dollar
Also behind the scenes the cultural differences between vietnamese and the American crew began to bubble over
Nowhere was this cultural divide more clearly illustrated than in the mind of the film special effects and stunt coordinator
Cody Keith Underwood
what was this place like before your came here
was it
this place was incredible
this is an animal sanctuary here first off and i believe it is a sacred land
the bush was thick the wildlife was thick so it took us maybe six or seven days basically just to get that shit out of here and just get it ready for what we are doing
something like that right there
i am not trying to be dirty but that kind of stuff honestly almost give me a boner
there is Mother Nature who is obviously way bigger than we are but here we are taking a piss on Mother Nature face right here
this is how we show that we are human
it is our instinct just to fuckin crack out of it and beat her in the little mouth
Look at that
Thats beautiful
i do not know how long those trees had been growing for
but look what i am fucking doing to him
i win
i just beat nature today
what happened to the theme of courage heroism and arrogance of America foreign policy
Almost uniformly people seemed indifferent to this subject matter alltogether making idiotic statements that from a P R perspective would do more harm than good
the only difference between this film and Vietnam is that with this film we are gonna win
Day 2 started out even worst than day 1
Adding to the tension the actual man Four Leaf Tayback had travelled to Vietnam for the first time in 30 years with the express purpose to advising Speedman on his POW scene
i was just sitting down to interview Four Leaf when my producer Friedrich slipped me a note
Tugg Speedman wanted to participate in the interview
it was the first time when Tugg had willingly sat down in front of my lens
i was happy to acomodate
it was also the first time the two men had met
it is been extremely difficult to learn how to use the hooks
i am holding an espresso
Four Leaf how hard has it been since you lost your hands
when i lost these it was like i saw through these for the first time
then i begin to realize that
i have never really used these
and i am trying to explain to him that he has to use something in himself somewhere
i have to find another coffee
this type he looks like a Buddha
i want to rub his belly for luck
Shortly after i turned off my camera for these interviews some alarming news came over the wire
a tropical typhoon was threatening the coastline and was projected to slam hard somewhere in the Southeast Asia
by morning the threat of typhoon had became more dire
the first signs of what was to came began to show themselves
despite this Damien whipping his crew onward like sled dogs demanded work continue
Mr Cockburn are we cutting
no we are still rolling
Still rolling
Still rolling
but by noon the situation was hopeless for the film
Speedman fled to Hollywood in his private plane
Lazarus again refusing to drop character charted a C 130 cargo plane to airlift himself his fake family and thankfully myself and my crew back to his fake real hometown Galveston Texas
it was here that we choosed to raid out the storm
but the storm had seemed to had come to Texas with us
Hey i heard that
Lazarus more than ever did not seem himself
he was acting erratic refused to sleep and was suffering explosiv outbursts
i am the fucking king of the mountain
you are crazy
i am crazy
Damn
Holy shit
what
yeah
something was terribly wrong
what we are seeing is an acute form of P P S D
i never heard of this
i am sorry
Post Platoon Stress Disorder
the first documented case was Charlie Sheen
and when you have an actor like Mr Lazarus
Hold on do not move
we cool
what it would be unusal if he did not suffer from this disorder
i gave you life
i gave you a coat
These fucking chips that is all me too baby
it is all my shit
i run this shit
the same diagnose has been given to Colin Farrell after Tigerland
Jim Caviezel after Thin Red Line and incredibly even Robin Williams after shooting Good Morning Vietnam
i was grateful at the end of it when we were able to return to the madness of Vietnam
Upon our return to Southeast Asia i was stunned
Total devastation
all the sets has been smashed like children's toothpicks and an entire battlefield was washed in the Mekong river
in just under two weeks and five days of shooting the production had lost almost 240 million dollar
all that he showed for it was several discombobulated scenes and a script that was in ruin
Les Grossman in a rage called the accounting to say he was pulling the plug the following morning
Faced with such an impossible deadline there was little hope in reviving the film
Later that night however in a brilliant move
Damien did something that was both politically sawy and economically feasible
he courageously choosed to shot the most heartbreaking and moving scene in the script
it was Speedman's monologue
Set it night in a trench
Four Leaf knowing his man an being led to the slaughter he is faced with the task of urging his men not just to fight but to fight bravely and to the death
if Damien could pulled off
Les Grossman would certainly see the film Oscar potential and loosen the purse strings yet again
Damien seemed calm
the mood by contrast was thick with anticipation
Four Leaf comes in and talks to them almost like a Christ like figure
if i could say that
yes you can
he is an almost Christ like figure then
i said that
there is a wonderful speech where he said
Death is but a moment
Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction
the idea that death being a moment is just both terrifying and yet strangely comforting
Just be discreet
he knows that we maybe coming
Follow me
Hey do not mind the guys thay just covering so
Reality show
Reality show
i wanted to talk to you
okay okay about the speech
Shoot daddy
i was wondering maybe you could skip some of my lines i got some of the other guys
because it feels a litthe bit like
i do not know it is a little bit talky
you hear me
yeah it is a lot of words but
i liked you to say
Death spring not from darkness
Yet be not affraid gentlemen for hope is its handmaiden
do not fear death because death is only a moment
Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction
that is what i am saying
for me i know my audience understand
they dont understand words like affliction and cowardish
it is cowardice
what is that mean
what do you mean
it is like a female coward
not cowardess it is cowardice
Cowardess
i C E ice
okay but you are understand that while we have this conversation
i gonna get popcorn and take a piss
oh boy
you know it should be like
Look we are going out there right
we gonna kick some ass right
or should be like
Tomorrow is gonna suck
Suck up and deal
Cock the gun
do not say it do it
Maggots
over and out
High five
do not say it do it
i
over and out
i do not know what that means
over and out
that we say on walkie talkie when we finished talking
no sorry
Excuse me
i know what over and out means
yeah it is something that everybody knows
Fucking cunt
the following morning after a fruitless night of shooting
Damien had become uncooperativ
i do not care no more
you are part of the machine
you are part of the machine
you think you are outside but you are part of the machine
Deal with it dude
i do not give a shit
so
he seemed to be almost totally unhinged
Shoot that
Put that ass as an attachment and send it as an email to Les Grossman
Good night Vienna
but in moments of this exchange word came down that Les Grossman had pulled the plug
so it is finally over
no it is not over
this is just the beginning
this is just the beginning
These cryptic words would come back to haunt me
in what whould be my final interview with him it was clear that something inside of Damien had completely shattered
i am in a place now which is
Umm it is a place of total clarity
i do not feel anger i feel just
Love perhaps
i feel
yeah i feel love
i do not bear any kind of
Resentment
Resentment or grudge
i am calm and i feel united
with yourself
yeah but let me fucking finish
Interrupting me Jesus
anyway i am feeling better
Damien was anything but feeling better
Early the next morning roused from my slumber
i received urgent and terrible news
what
what is it
Damien and the cast had gone missing
what
the greatest fear of every documentarian is that they themselves will become their own subject but with this new developments i had no choice
i leaped into action and hatched an action plan
Find Damien and the cast
they were last seen boarding a chopper that had flown in a north west direction into one of the most lethal and dangerous part of Southeast Asia
we had many kilometers to cover and the jungle would be unforgiving
however by nightfall we had made faint signs of progress
we just come across this which appears to be some blood
i going to touch it
i do not like touching things it is dirty but i am going through
yes thats blood
i will try it
yes it is blood
Taste like iron
two more hours we trekked through the jungle and just when we were about to turn ourselves back we came across the most tantalizing pice of evidence so far
Looks like a video recorder
there is a tape inside
it is very exciting
i returned to the hotel with pits in my stomach eager to play the tape
Damien was indeed on the tape and so was the rest of the actors
but also there was something so shocking and so awful that i questioned whether my eyes were actually lying to me
Worst of all it had actually happened to human beings
the thought that people had experienced this made me question life God humanity and the point of living
several weeks after shooting i even became suicidal
this is probably the single most disturbing awful and disgusting film i ever seen
i watch it one more time
Let's go and make the greatest war movie ever
yeah
yeah
yes
and watched again i did
what is important it is not the amazing footage which you will never see but instead the lives of artists who tried to make Tropic Thunder
i remember them as the human beings they were not the grotesque pieces of human remains they become
what is it that drove Damien to the edge of lunacy
Why did the cast sabotaged itself
and finally what about Hollywood the land of false promises
what is the answer to all of these questions
i will never tell you
what i have showed you is in the end the truth
not this spoonfed Hollywood version of it
this time unlike Hollywood you must decide for youself what is real and what is illusion
but be warned you may find yourself a prisoner to Hollywood and it is torrential rain of madness
from out of the dark is the South Central g ready hand steady on a bloody machete
a devil is on my shoulder
should i kill it
Hell yeah
i slice Jack took an ax and gave that bitch Jill forty wacks
with my hip hop it do not stop until heads roll off the cutting block
Da Lench Mob Cut Throats Planet of Da Apes 1994the estimated number of missing persons in Turkey is 3000
some say it is much more than that
some of these missing persons got lost while they were under probation
every year over 1000 gets lost because of normal causes and only half of them can be found
to my mom
and to all moms
is it him
there was a tale i told to Veysel when he was young
a tale about a boy who has been kidnapped by the elfs
little boy without the permission of his mother goes on a very long vacation with the elfs kidnapped him
to a long very long vacation
he gets lost
and Veysel used to cry for that boy just as i did when i was young
he used to ask he will come back won't he mom
in the tale the boy always used to come back and got married with the fairies' queen
are you better now
yes yes thank you
i felt bad suddenly
Very natural
it is been years i last saw a body with a destroyed face
are you sure it is not your son
what is his name
Veysel
of course i am sure
do you want to look again
he is not Veysel
that was the third body you saw
None of them is Veysel

None of them is Veysel
None of them

yes
Saw him years ago at Kadir's funeral
i recall he looks like him
he looks more like me
i mean that is what they say
my son looks like me too but the mother says the opposite
if Veysel is like his father they say he is involved politically
is it true
no such thing
Good good
Really no such thing
OK
you know we were not so close with Kadir
i was always distant to his political thoughts
they were not for me
Consequently we can say he entrusted you to us
he used to take films at strikes i remember
he had such strange hobbies
Rest in peace
that is it Ms Sukran
this is all i will say
i did not want to talk with you earlier
but i expect you care your work more
do not let me or yourself get in trouble
everything will be alright i am sure
you will be relaxed too
all that ends well is well
Hopefully so
Ms Sukran
Ms Sukran
Mr Ahmet i am sorry i was preoccupied
are you alright
any news
no no news
so strange
i do not know i really do not
how are you
Good
so so
what do the police say
nothing new
they called me to the morgue today
but thank God it was somebody else
a young boy Veysel's age
Smashed face
Really very young boy
Terrible things happening these days
Really terrible
are you OK Ms Sukran
you are OK
do you want more cologne
you go get a cup of tea with sugar
i do not remember losing my consciousness ever until that day
that day i lost my consciousness twice
i thought about death and i felt that it was my closest moment to death
i felt myself not only incredibly light but also as that much heavy and fragile
although i felt as if my whole body has lost all its weight
i was also scared that i would break into pieces like glass if i ever fall down
at that moment i was thinking about Veysel
he would grab my arm at the very last minute and would not let me break into pieces i said to myself
MlSSlNG PERSON

his body was ice cold
Dead
he is dead
that is not Veysel
he is alive i saw him
the body is not his it is not Veysel
i recognized him
it is him
do you know my son better than i do
i recognized him
his face was destroyed but
i saw the mole in his groin
he was Veysel
his groin
that is nonsense
there are no moles in my son's groin
you are fooling yourself
you poisoned him
with your ideas
i did not do anything
you poisoned him
Filled his mind with bullshit
a brilliant boy
Spotless
he was not as innocent as you think
at least not in your standards
he did nothing Veysel nothing
but they still destroyed him
and they will not leave you alone
Just because you are his mother
in fact you know everything
you lived through it all with your husband
God knows how many times they took him
what did you do
Took shelter in Veysel
and now he is gone too
Gone
i do not understand why you hide and deny now
Avoiding him from being like his father
Brought up a clean boy on her own
you could not protect him
you lived in a dream world and you still are
do not be rude
you do not know your son you just love him
i know and love my son a lot
what will i do without him
you will find someone else
some other naive boy
he is lying in cold now
Veysel or someone else
as if it matters to you
Veysel is not dead
he lives
Mr Rifat
Mr Rifat
no news Ms Sukran
no
Did did you hear any news
the police came the other day
i have never been to the station before
because of your son and that Halil they interrogate me as if i am guilty
Asking me the account of all this
Veysel did not do anything
we got you into distress too Mr Rifat
to hell with him and that fucker Halil
i am sorry but i am fed up with all this
Mind your own business
or else i will whack you up
Excuse me
but i am messed up
and you keep showing up everyday
have you heard from Halil
no
if you hear anything
OK i will let you know
i do not think we will hear any more
Miss
Miss
Halil is gone
Left a day later
what
where did he go
he ran away when Veysel was taken
Veysel was not arrested
he was not
the police denies
where is Halil
Ask Halil's father
in Beyoglu
Tell me everything you know about Veysel
Ask his father
you tell me
i know nothing
Why did not you tell before
Tell me
i know nothing
i just wanted to help you
there you go
you did not count
what
you did not count your pay
you used to count always
and you are late to get it too
one can not think of pay though
i forgot thanks
my duty
i loved Kadir a lot Ms Sukran
he was like an elder brother to me
a good man
yes he was
Ms Sukran if there is anything i can do please let me know
Please do not hesitate
nothing thank you
Kadir's death was a blow to us too
Veysel's not dead Mr Salih
not dead
they say he is shot Ms Sukran
he is said to be shot
Ms Sukran
are you all right
i am OK
all right
it is hard
it is hard of course
my heart aches too
for not being able to help you
but it will all pass
it will pass
i am just worried for you
do not worry i will be all right
that is what they all say
but something happens eventually
i am really all right
do you go to his room at night to check his bed covers
do you dream of him
i dreamt of him a few times
Weird
he called me Aunt Melek
he is my dearest
i never had any children you know
i wanted to have children
i really wanted
but i did not
God wanted it this way
i did not know you were married
where is your husband
he is dead
Twelve years ago
Easy on the ear
Twelve years
he was a miner in Zonguldak
the mine caved in
i waited three months at the entrance
i went there every single day waited for him
Waited for him to come
he did not
i am getting late to work
i said he did not come
you will wait in vain and then get used to it
Humankind is such a low creature it gets used to anything
i am getting late
i said he did not come
we aim to show our solidarity
we are here to share your feelings
we cooperate with the families to find the missing and inform the families on any news
WE ARE SlTTlNG HERE FOR THE PROBATlON MlSSlNG

Only dead men shelter to their pictures
Once death takes its place at the frames it chases us

Sule
i asked for Huseyin there were two soldiers they went inside and stayed
they stayed in for ten minutes and then they said no such person came in
there was another station down there
i went there they asked and searched
they asked each others and said no one called Huseyin came here for sure
then i went up took my husband
Left him home and came again
i saw different soldiers
i told them to please understand
he must be hungry let me give him a piece of bread i said
they went in and said yes Huseyin was brought here just this afternoon
i cooked some thing for them and my son
they said he was OK here
i knew he was not guilty so i was a little bit relieved
because they asked if your son is not guilty so i was relaxed
but my feet were swollen of course the whole day with slippers
i told the brother take this melon to Huseyin he said Huseyin is not there
i was out of my mind and said something happened to him
they said he was there and now they say he is not here
that night i stayed up until the morning i went to the mountains and shouted
it was as if the mountains screamed together with me
i cried a lot
i go to check the boys to see whose eyes they resemble
if they have my son's eyes my son's hands
they saw him killed wrapped in a blanket
they saw his shirt
they phoned and said the shirt wrapped in a blanket they took him to the river
and then left him there
he is there my son
i just said give me his bones let me have a grave
i always wanted this but this did not happen
Disappearing is very difficult
Sukran
Sukran stop
you bitch
Worthless bitch
Whatever
you bitch
Admit he is dead
they won't give the body to me
Take it
that is not Veysel
he is
i saw Veysel
he is alive
i will find him and we will spit on your face
you are dreaming
Take him from there
Why do you have toast every lunch
is not the answer obvious
do not you cook the food

you are kidding
no
Eating toast with you makes me happy
that bum counts every bite i take
Come on
Really
Come tomorrow let me give you a feast
Thank you
i will stay home
what will you do at home on your own
Mr Ahmet
i am sorry to disturb
of course not please come in
i could not sleep last night
something strange happened
i hesitated to tell
i was restless all night
Why something happened
last night a cousin of mine Cezmi came to visit
he is a policeman
i hadn't seen of him since a long time
he talks a lot anyway
he told me something weird
what
a youngster
while he was detained he ran away during transfer
he escaped when the car had an accident
they ran after him but could not get him
his name was Veysel
i was not sure of myself
i inquired more but he did not answer
the boy escaped they all ran after him but they could not catch him
they kept it from the papers
it is been 5 10 days
he says he was seen in another city
where
i do not know
he did not say
i insisted but he did not say a word more
and i did not insist more because he could be suspicious
Maybe it is all coincidence
or Cezmi's exaggeration
i do not know
where is this Cezmi
Uncle Ahmet
this is not right
this was supposed to be between us
but it is a special situation
i do not care
Turn the volume down
this was supposed to be a secret
so you can not keep any
is it him
you are toying with my profession
do not exaggerate
Just information
i said is it him
Uncle
is it him
Looks like him
i think it is him
i saw him very briefly
a few minutes
Maybe it is him
how would i know
where was he last seen
Mardin
he was last seen in Mardin
Your son is dangerous
they won't let him live for long
what is he doing in Mardin
Why should he go there
his father was from there
but there is nobody left there
i had never thought about the distances until that day
i have never imagined' the far away'
that they when i learn where my son could be as the trust of my son being alive
i also understood the distances can be boring
he was there
at a place far away
i was here missing him
my heart needed him
he was far away from me a place where i have no idea of
' Far away' is where my son is
this is my first real vacation in my life
the longest the most unquite and the most hopeful vacation
i had never seen beyond Ankara
i had no idea about the beyond of Ankara
the only thing i knew was Vesyel was waiting for me somewhere there
he killed three people
what
the boy inside
Murderer of three
he shot three in their heads
Vendetta
he escaped
to Diyarbakir
Mardin
i will go to Mardin from there
Mardin is hot in this season
Excuse me
Mardin i said
it is hot in this season
have a nice voyage
as i look back to the ones i have left
i now feel more like reaching to a place than leaving
a place a land a sky that i have never seen

Your head sister
Miss Sukran
you will come with us
is this your son Veysel Aksu
he is
that day i left everything behind me
i thought that it would be the longest vacation of my life
the longest and the most hopeful
but every vacation has an end
a vacation is a place you first go then leave and come back to your home
with always'hope' and always'despair'
Always'finding' and always'losing'
the ones we think lost are actually the ones we search at wrong places
in fact they are waiting for us behind a door
a door that will open one day to a wide wide desert
you wait with a restless heart to meet your beloved on the other side
you feel a breeze blowing through the door from the desert with his smell
you want to go to have peace but the door is closed for you
there are days you must live
nothing calms your heart
nothing
Only one thing a whisper heard through the keyhole
Saying he will come back won't he Mommy
yes he will darling
he will come backPreviously on Justice League
what are you doing here
i am investigating a crime
we suspect one of your amazons may be involved
Hippolyta
i feared as much
you see Aresia was not born an Amazon
she comes from man's world
her homeland became the battlefield
for a bloody and senseless war
Aresia survived
Clinging to a piece of floating wreckage
Miraculously she washed ashore here on Themyscira
then we amazons adopted her
and magically endowed her with Amazon strength
Aresia
Diana
I'd love to stay and chat
but you might want to look after your friend
Superman
Uhh
what is all this
i think we have a right to know
coughing
Ohh
Hawkgirl
it is like some kind of plague
and half the city's got it
Batman
yes
the male half
Sirens
Emergency response units
we need backup at 5th and Horton
oh
Woman
got another one
Eyes glassy and nonresponsive
so the poison only affects men
Exactly
that is why it did not hurt you two
but why
what do you have to gain from all of this
what do i have to gain
Look around you
Man's world is filled with greed deception and cruelty
but i am going to change all that
Today we women take control
you can not be serious
can not i
Lucky i found this one
but he is not doing well
i will get him to a hospital
Wonder Woman
Batman
you were right
it was a renegade Amazon
i know
i just could not believe
that one of my sisters could actually
Uhh
Woman
Look out
groaning
Batman
Wonder Woman
how is he J onn
Just like the others
Whatever they have
it appears to be an allergen
not a virus
but i can not seem to isolate it
Still every puzzle must have a solution
so where do we start
that is easy
we find Aresia
Even when she was a child
i sensed a bitterness within her
she was never really one of us
i think she fits in pretty well
how can you say that
Aresia's just taking
Your precious Amazon code
to its logical extension
we do not teach hatred
Except when it comes to men
Aargh
Woman
you there
Halt
Well done
it is perfect absolutely perfect
for what
more betrayal more destruction
Your highness
you of all people should understand why i am doing this
no
you have violated sacred Amazonian law
i am sorry you see it that way
Hippolyta
oh
but i have come too far to turn back now
Sirens
do you need help here
Thanks but we finally got this one contained
any remaining victims
Just sent the last one to Gotham general
Good work ladies
Let's wrap this up
they seem to be on top of things
Impressive
Almost reminds me of home
yes but who wants to live in a world without men
they can not possibly be that essential to your life
do not knock it till you have tried it princess
Let's find Aresia
this is Medivac 9 requesting clearance over
Look out
Aah
Aah
i have got you sisters
Aah
Great
Hurry
Star Sapphire
Need a hand
Relax
i am not here to fight
in fact i came to warn you
about Aresia
she is crazy
she wants to wipe out all the men in the world
we noticed
where is she
she and Tsukuri are at the air base
but it may already be too late
that is the last one
all the chemicals are on board
Good
then there is just one unfinished matter to attend to
Woman
and it will remain unfinished
oh
Uhh
Haaa
Uhh
groaning
what took you
Forgive our little deception
Diana i had Star Sapphire bring you here
so i could offer you one last chance
to join our noble cause
Man's world may not be perfect
but destroying it is not the answer
you would stand against us your sisters
yes
a pity
Aah
Aah
Aah
Uhh
a valiant effort Diana but you won't stop us
i guarantee it
Let her go
you are in no position to give orders here
do not move
i am warning you
i do not want to hurt her but i will
Aah
Aah
Well done Sapphire
Tsukuri get us out of here
Mother
Diana i found this inside
the allergen
has to be
it might be the key to an antidote
you take it to J onn
i will stop Aresia
Think you can catch that thing
it is fast but so am i
Almost done
Good
we will be at the launch site in less than an hour
and then
i shoot these cruise missiles
into the upper atmosphere
after they explode
the winds will scatter my poison all over the world
and i can say good bye to some very unpleasant men
i have known over the years
you can say good bye to all of them
grunting
J'onn i have got a sample of oh no
the allergen it must have been on Superman's costume
and when i touched it
J'onn
what happened
i have lost the hydraulics
grunting
how long can you keep us in the air
i do not know
we are still losing altitude
then we will have to launch from here
i will recompute the coordinates
crash
Go see what that was
uh oh
Better hurry with those launch codes
what
we have got company
you know what to do
Aah
you fools do not you see
we are not your enemy
it is the men
they must be destroyed
Hippolyta
you are wrong Aresia
without men
you would not still be here
after your ship sank
you must have lost consciousness
as you drifted on your makeshift raft
you would surely have drowned
had the ship's captain not found you and pulled you to safety
Valiantly he struggled to keep you alive
Until he brought you to the shores of Themyscira
neighs
but the effort was too much for his heart
his final resting place is a simple unmarked grave
he is the only man ever buried on Themyscira
so you see
for all your hatred of men
it turns out you owe your life to one
Why did not you ever tell me about this
i did not think it was important
i did not think he was important
Maybe it is time to reconsider that
so everything you ever preached was a lie
not everything
Still the acts of one man
Cannot redeem the sins of his kind
they all must pay
no
Aah
Haaa
Haaa
Bay 2 won't open
Try number 3
Uhh
Ugh
Ugh
Humpf
Haaa
Shut the missile off
it is too late
Wait
you can not leave
i like you but not that much
Poor Aresia
may the gods grant her peace at last
how are you feeling
Better
it is a good thing you were able to recover
Aresia's notes from her hideout
yes
without them we might never have found the antidote
Hawkgirl
Superman and Green Lantern
have almost finished distributing it
if only Aresia could have learned to see
the noble qualities in you men
Flash
i definitely could have taught that bad babe
a thing or two about guys
Too bad we never met
burps
Maybe it is just as welloh Miss Astley
you are back already
hello are you awake
i came back early
what is this
Nan you surprised us
we did not look for you until tomorrow
we were going to tell you Nan when you came back
Tell me what
Kitty
no it is not true
i am so sorry Nan
Tell me it is not true Kitty
it is true Nan
Aah
oh
no do not touch me
Go away
Go away
Aah
oh Kitty
what have you done
do not be horrible to me Nan
i could not help it
oh he forced you did he
so that is what all your business meetings were about
all this time when i thought you were mine
no it was not like that
Until last night it was just talk and kisses
i swear it Nan
we were going to tell you everything
everything
Good God what more is there to tell
Kitty and i are going to be married Nan
i am sure in time you will come to see it is for the best
no
no
do not you see Nan it would not do to go on as we were
i believe you have killed me
the pair of you
oh come now compose yourself Nan
i know this has come as a shock to you but this carry on is quite out of proportion
Out of proportion
do not you know
Hasn't she told you about us
i know that you were sweethearts of a kind
of a kind
the kind that hold hands
did not she tell you that we fuck each other
i do not care to use such language Nan
and if i did i would not use that word for anything a pair of girls can do
you need a man for that i think you will find
Eh Kitty
Good bye
Nan
you said we'd be together forever
you said you loved me
you said you loved me
you said we'd be together forever
you said we'd be together forever
you said you loved me
Loved me
Loved me
Loved me
Kitty and i are going to be married Nan
i walked the streets all that day not knowing where i was going
i wanted to see nothing to feel nothing to remember nothing
everyone i knew and loved had betrayed me
you need a man for that i think you will find
you need a man
you need a man i think you will find
you said you loved me
how could she let him touch her
i hated them and wanted to die
but i would not let them do that to me
Morning Nan
oh you do not look a thing at all
Kitty's not in is she
or Mr Bliss
no fear a bit early for them
yes
i have come about the room
the house i keep here is a tidy one
i like my lodgers ditto
i have had trouble with single ladies in the past
who you see or what you do outside my house is your concern but there is one thing i won't have and that is gentlemen followers in a single lady's room
you will have no trouble on that score from me Mrs Best
5 shillings a week
in advance
Late payment will not be tolerated
i expect the room to be kept clean at all times
no cats dogs rabbits
now i was truly alone a poor outcast from life's feast tormented by my memories
it is nice and hot
you really should take something miss
for nigh on two months
i never left that room
i barely washed and never changed my dress for i had no other
i believe i would have faded away altogether if it weren't for the little maid Nell who brought me morsels of food and urged me to eat them
Nice and hot miss
Kitty and i are going to be married
to join together this man and this woman
you said you loved me
it was done
it was over
i suppose i had been hoping that she would change her mind and come and find me but now i knew for certain she was lost to me
it was time to face the world alone though i had no idea how i should live in it
but i found that to walk alone in London is not an easy thing for a woman to do
hello darling
Oi
Oi
what is the matter love
got sick because you found a penny
you hold onto me and i will treat you
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
here only asking
Cow
i thought what a cruel joke that i who had swaggered across the stages of London should be afraid to walk upon the streets
and most of all i wished that i could escape from my miserable self
Looking for a room
how long dear
Just an hour
one hour only mind
hello dear
you looking for a nice time
not today dear
Perhaps another time eh
all right dear
do not forget now
and for the first time since that terrible day
i felt a sort of freedom and a sort of strength
Somehow i had taken the first steps that would lead me out of my misery and into some different way of living though i had no idea what that would be
my little stock of money was dwindling fast and i was going to have to find some way of replenishing it or starve
Necessity is a hard taskmaster
and if the opportunity had presented itself
i dare say i should have sunk so low as to become a thief
Good evening Tommy Atkins
Buying a little present for your sweetheart
could not afford anything here sir
that is a shame
she will have to be content with a kiss then eh
Haven't got no sweetheart
not anymore
no sweetheart
Good looking lad like you
i find that hard to believe
are you up for it Tommy for a sovereign
Up for what sir
i do not understand you
Come on you know the game Tommy
you are all at it you soldier boys your hands are never off each other's cocks
not me sir
i only joined up last week
i have never done anything like that
then it is time you began my boy
Just take it your hand only a minute's work and there is a sovereign in it for you
oh have a heart Tommy
i am hard as a broom handle and aching for a spend
Nan Astley could never have given the answer that i gave him
but Tommy Atkins took us both by surprise
Come on then
Ooh
Slow and steady Tommy dear
Mmm
Go on
i thought if this were Walter
I'd bite it off
oh
Steady on
Ooh
Ooh oh
Ooh
oh
Ohh
oh
i suppose i should have felt ashamed but i felt nothing but surprise and a kind of fierce elation that in a couple of minutes
I'd earned enough to keep me for a couple of weeks
and so i my new career as a streetwalker and i found it not so very different from acting on the stage
i told myself it was not Nan Astley who took men's spunk in my mouth or in my hand
but Tommy Atkins or Eton Bertie or Able Seaman Simms or Bobby Brown from Birmingham
but now i was in a regular way of business
i needed a more regular way of life
i had had enough of changing in filthy rooms that reeked of men's spendings
Perhaps this respectable lady would accommodate the needs of a rather unusual female
Good afternoon
Good afternoon
i have come about the room
Say good day to the lady Grace
Good day Grace
oh dear
to tell the truth we were hoping for someone a bit older
a widow perhaps
you see um my daughter's um a rather unusual trusting sort of girl
i would not like to have young fellows coming in and out
there would not be any young fellows Mrs Milne
that i will guarantee
and I'd never get behind with my rent
Well
you see the thing is
i work as a kind of entertainer at parties and suchlike
and for that
i sometimes dress in gentlemen's suits
now if you and Grace do not mind that
i think i might do very well
Gentlemen's suits you say
Well Grace what do you think of that
would you like to see one Grace
Ha ha
my eyes Grace what a beauty
would you like to try it Grace
yes please
now is not that kind of the lady
Ha ha ha
she gave me the first floor front 8 shillings a week
i think she'd have let me have it for nothing for Grace's sake
sometimes i thought she must have been as simple as her daughter for she never asked where i went or what i did
i am off then Mrs M
See you tomorrow Gracie
you take as long as you like dear
you have your own key
Bye then
some nights i did not need to go out
i told myself that this was freedom
Perhaps that was the secret of happiness to expect nothing or expect very little
what is it that soldiers say
if you are warm dry and smoking that is happiness
Evening sweetheart
how are you
Florence are you ready
Florence
Florence
who knows what it is that draws one person to another
but for the first time in months
i felt something of my old self stirring in me
i wanted to see more of Florence
and soon enough i did
hello again
i hope i did not frighten you the other night
i am sorry i do not
Evening sweetheart
how are you
oh that was you
Quite right
you live up there do you
i do
and you live there
that is right
we were very lucky
Mother and i lost our other house but Miss Darby found us this one
and now i work for her charity finding homes for others
Well that is nice
i was just going to the park
will you come with me
oh no i have got so many calls
oh
but i go along that way
so you are not in your trousers today then
no
i like to change and change about
Boy one day girl the next
does that shock you
no i do not think so
i can see it must have advantages
i suppose you can go where you like
you can do as you like
Exactly so
Hit the nail on the head
Miss Darby would be most interested
she is writing a book about the woman question
Perhaps she'd like to put me in it then
i certainly think she'd be interested in meeting you
i did not give a tinker's fart for Miss Darby or the woman question
but i knew i wanted to see more of Florence
i wonder would you like to come to a lecture with me
at the Atheneum Hall
it is on women and labor
a lecture
i say that is just my style i do not think
but i will give it a go if you like
Really
Said so did not i
when is it
00
we can meet for some tea beforehand if you like
Done
you live with your mother do not you
that is right
before that we lived just round the corner
do you know
i have never been out of Islington
Very adventurous eh
you do not have to travel far to have adventures
you are not from round here are you
no
so where did you come from
Kent
Whitstable
it is a seaside place
i used to work in an oyster bar
so do you go back there very often see your ma and pa
they are dead
oh
i am sorry
no need to be
it was a long time ago
so what work did you do in London
in a shop
what sort of a shop
a hat shop
Well I'd never have imagined that
Why not
i do not know
you just do not seem the sort
i bet they do not
let you wear your trousers in there
Ha ha
no
no of course not
so
what do you do there exactly
do you serve in the shop or are you in the back making the hats up
i just can not seem to imagine you there somehow
i well no
i could not keep it up
she was so sweet and straight i could not bear to lie to her
but i could not tell her the truth either
is there a ladies' lavatory here
yes through there i think
i won't be a tick
what made me think
i could be friends with a respectable girl
all that was over for me
if she could have seen me known what i really did and what i really used those clothes for
i belonged in the gutter
what is your business
do not do anything i would not do dear
you game for it sonny
it is a sov for a dubbing two for a suck but i won't be buggered
i do not pay more than a sov for a soldier
Dubbing or nothing then
Know a place
Follow me
this is the place sir
Come on then
Ah
Let's see what you are made of soldier boy
no
i said no
Let me up
i will cut you i will
Keep still or you will get worse
Ah
uh
all right me boy
Your safe now
you come with me
you won't be hurt
Please constable let me go
it was my very first time sir
he made me
Constable
i am no constable
Somebody's taken a fancy to you
you have got nothing to fear
i won't be buggered
in you go
Good evening
i never thought
Well now you see you have nothing to fear
i will see you safely home
or my own house is quite nearby
Let me offer you a hot toddy to calm your nerves
you were in a little difficulty just now i think
yes thanks ever so
that chap said he'd buy me a drink and next thing i knew he dragged me off the street
i had a bad fright there but i shall know better next time
shall you
so you were perfectly innocent were you
no idea at all what a gentleman on the town might want with a young soldier boy
no miss
Well that is a surprise
i had the impression that you understood the game pretty well
i have been watching you for a while young man
there is no need to be coy with me
i am sorry miss you have made a mistake
no i do not think i have
Truly you have miss
i am very grateful but honest
i am not what you are looking for
oh yes i think you are
but i am a girl
do you think i did not know that you little fool
though you wear the outfit far better than most of the lads do and you have the legs for it too oh yes
and none of your gentlemen guessed
if they did they did not say
and anyway i was pretty strict about what they could and could not touch
and it all went off all right
Until tonight
Pretty strict were you
i wonder should i like you to be pretty strict with me
there is no need to be afraid
this could be the luckiest night of your life
Come come where is your sense of adventure
Take my arm
do not think of making a run for it
Corder is quick as well as strong
that will be all tonight thank you Blake
yes ma'am
Good night ma'am
Night sir
Come come
how warm it is in here
not too warm for you i hope
Perhaps a bit
what is your name
Nancy
King
and i think you might have offered me a glass of wine and a cig
i beg your pardon Miss King
my name is Lethaby Mrs Diana Lethaby
have you heard that name before
no
all the better
there
if you were the king of pleasure and i were the queen of pain
you are very handsome Miss King
i know
oh what have we here i wonder
so all your promises come to nothing after all
Take those off
Give me the glass and the cigarette
Quickly
you may leave the jacket on
and the boots
and the hat
Good
now go through there into the bedroom and open the chest under the mirrors
Pronto
Put it on
Put it on and come to me
Come here
you exquisite little tart
oh you sleep like a child
i have been up this half hour making a fearful row and still you slumbered on
i have rung for breakfast
i hope you are hungry
yes
yes i am
Good
Ah here she is
Good morning ma'am
Good morning miss
Very good Blake
Draw a bath for Miss King
oh and tell Mrs Hooper i will speak to her about luncheon
yes ma'am
there is a Persian story i read as a girl
a beggar sets a genie free from a bottle and is rewarded with a wish
he can live in ordinary comfort for 70 years or in pleasure with a princess for a bride servants every desire satisfied for 500 days
now if you were that beggar which would you choose
the pleasure
Good
Ha ha ha
so did the beggar
so will you stay with me Nan and be pleasured and pleasure me in your turn
Stay with you as what
Your guest your friend your servant
as my tart you silly girl
no no no no not in a hole and corner way
you will ride out with me to the park attend me at the theatre wear the finest clothes but you will belong to me and we will pleasure each other
how does that seem
i do not know
i do not know enough about you to know whether i like you and you do not know me
i know all i need to know about you
you are like me
you showed it last night and you are showing it now
you hunger for your own sex
you hunger for the pleasure i can give you do not you
yes
there are moments in our lives
that night when Kitty cast her rose at me and sent my admiration tumbling over into love and this was another the start of a new life
how do you like yourself
not bad
Smarter than anything i wore down the dilly
it is your coming out suit
i had begun my new life
and what a life and what a world
it was so easy to get sucked in
Look how they eye you men and women both
Hah
They'd all love to have you but they shan't' cause you are mine bought and paid for
Diana you old roue
you have done it at last
Ladies allow me to present my companion
Miss King
this is Mrs Jex Nan quite my oldest friend in London and quite the most disreputable
everything she says and does is designed to corrupt
i am afraid i have been corrupted already Mrs Jex
Ha
Good
Good god
it talks
that is Dickie Miss King
a touch of the green eyed monster there
Charmed
Likewise
so tell me Miss King where does a little treasure
like you come from
Like me
there is no one quite like me Mrs Jex
but if you want to know i was born by the seaside in Whitstable where the oysters come from
Whitstable
would you believe it
she is a Whitstable mermaid
Like a mermaid
Come along child
but the Whitstable mermaid was no more
this was my life now
for the most part she kept me close and displayed me at home
the boy they called me
she contrived tableaux so that they could feast their eyes on me
she enjoyed that that they could look but could not touch
they knew that she would be enjoying me later
Ladies tonight we give you
Hermaphrodite
oh
oh
Oo
we were a perfect double act
i was the living proof of her perversity
i was the stain left by her lust
she had awakened something perverse in me too and i could not imagine a life beyond her shaping
Ow
Sorry Miss
Easier to put on than take off this stuff
where is Mrs Lethaby
Gone out Miss
she went out before you woke up
Well she might have told me
Well she can please herself can not she
not like you and me
do you like being a maid here Blake
it is a very good place Miss but I'd rather be my own mistress
what would you do if you were your own mistress
I'd set up my own boarding house in the colonies
i am saving from my wages towards it now
a boarding house in the colonies
yeah for ladies
Well maybe i will come and stay in it some day
You'd be very welcome Miss
to mark the passing of time
do you know you have been with me longer than any of the others
Quite an achievement
Take our coats
Dickie Clara
the boy will take our coats
oh there there
what a little angel
there
Take care will you
Ladies and gentleman will you please hurry along to your seats
the curtain will rise in 3 minutes
Thank you sir
two gents and two ladies
do not you know me Bill
Nan King
have you got a sec
Give us two ticks Raymond
what happened to you then Nan
what have you been doing
oh you was missed and you still are
there was never an act like you and Kitty Butler's
do you hear from Mr Bliss
or Kitty
oh yes
they have got an act together now playing just down the road at the Strand Palace
what
Tonight
what time are they on
second half just after the interval
what is the boy doing
he is talking to the nigger at the cloaks
I'd better go and thanks Bill
can not take him anywhere
i think you should get a collar and chain Diana
and a whip
Tssssss
Excuse me
Call of nature
See where she is going
i had to see her
i had to see Kitty again
where is my little Willie now
he is my only comfort and my only joy
now his mother's gone to heaven
all i have got's my little boy
can anybody tell me
where is my little Willie now
Ooooh
Ooooh
Hey father
i have been looking for you all over
oh Willie
Come to your dad and give us a kiss
and do not you ever run away again me boy
can anybody tell me
where is my little Willie now
been sick in the gents
Sorry
i know where you have been tonight
Corder followed you
but what i want to know is why
there was an actor i wanted to see
who
a girl i used to know
who damn you
a girl i once loved more than anyone more than myself
more than you love me
much more than i love you
i do not love you at all
i hate you
oh Kitty
Kitty
you feeling better Miss
you looked ever so poorly last night
oh yes
i shall live
Come sit down Blake
Talk to me
what about Miss
Well what is your first name
it is Zena Miss
Mrs Lethaby says she got you out of a reformatory
what were you there for
i was sent there on account of a girl
i was friends with at a house in Kentish Town
we were maids there together
so you were a maid before you came here
Went out as a skivvy when i was 10 and then i got the place at Kentish Town when i was 14
i was a housemaid then and
i got very thick with another maid there called Agnes
Agnes had a chap
she threw the chap over Miss for my sake
that is how thick we was
and it was Agnes got you sent to the reformatory
no Miss
it was another girl
she was jealous of me and Agnes
it was her that told the missis
and Mrs Lethaby does she know why you were in the reformatory
oh yeah she knows alright
she is a great friend of the Lady Governor
has Mrs Lethaby ever tried
not since you came Miss
it was only once or twice in any case
i think she just wanted to make it clear like that she could do what she wanted with me
oh yes
i can believe that alright
will there be anything else Miss
no not just now
Thank you
Very good miss
what had become of me
what had i become
she spoke of love and it touched me
but i felt too spoiled and stained for love
besides i was still obsessed with Diana for all her casual cruelty
i must have been for it would've been easy enough you would think just to walk out of the house one day when she was out walk out forever and leave no word of farewell
Thank you Corder
i hated myself
but still after nearly two years
i was on fire for her as she was for me
i had started and i had to take that journey with her right the way to the end though i feared it would be a bad end
Well did you miss me
what do you care if i miss you or not
now now little soldier no sulks
of course i care
do not you know you are the love of my life
and then in March came Diana's 40th birthday
she decided to celebrate it with a fancy dress party
i chose to go as Antinous
Hadrian's favorite page who drowned in the Nile
his sad fate suited my mood
i hated my life but i could not leave it
what do you think
i think you look lovely Miss
i hated it all but i still had my pride
i would still be the most beautiful thing in the place desired by all inaccessible to any but my mistress
Shh shh shh shh shh shh
Ladies ladies
i give you
Antinous
what no dildo
where is Monsieur Dildo
he might come later but remember this is a very sweet and virtuous Roman boy
yes delightful mmm
you look like a picture from a bugger's compendium my dear
Thank you kindly i am sure
and what might you be wearing under that young man
Just a little au de Cologne
no
you must not touch or look
Just use your imagination
do not get much chance to use anything else these days
God look at Dickie
what is she supposed to be
Dorian Gray i believe
i swear to you it was as big as a boy's doodle and as stiff as my thumb
she blames it on her Hindu nurse
i have seen that amongst the Turks as well
they are bred like it in order to pleasure themselves and the seraglio
we needn't go as far as that to find it
English girls in the slums all have'em
they are brought up 20 to a bed frgging all night
no wonder they look at
i was sick of it the backbiting the bitching
something inside me was getting ready to explode
if we had a girl from the slums here
I'd pull down her drawers myself and show you the proof
oh what does Antinous say
you used to be a little slum slut did not you once upon a time
of course Blake
Come here
Come here
Ooh
you are a reformatory girl are not you
oh
are not you
yes ma'am
Good
Lower your drawers and lift up your skirt
oh good god girl
do i have to come and do it for you
Leave her alone
what
Let her alone
Go back to the kitchens Blake
Stay where you are
and as for you ha ha ha do you think you are mistress here
what is it to you if i ask my girl to show me what she is got between her legs
you have done the same thing yourself often enough
Get back behind the curtain
and when we finish with Blake perhaps we will all take turns upon Antinous
you should not talk to me like that
you do not own me
oh Lord what a bore
what a bore
Ha
nothing to you you old cow
got up like a boy of 17
Dorian Gray
Look in the glass
you are more like the portrait in me attic
and that goes for the rest of you you tired old trotters
Why do not you all just fuck off on this girl's word
i can not take any one of you
i think you are a little overexcited Nancy
you will go to your room now and when you have had time to think you will come down and apologize
then we will devise a little punishment for you
something suitably Roman maybe
what are you gonna do then
Throw me to the lions
i know one thing
I'd make a tastier meal than you you worn out pathetic old trollop
oh Zena
what a night
i have got a cloth with a bit of ice in it
if you just let me
it is all right
it is all shh
what is it
can i stay here with you Miss
i am frightened to go back to my own room with those ladies roaming all over the house
yes you can stay
what is in the bottle
Brandy
Miss
L
i
i thought for the shock
Give it here
oh Miss
oh please do
Did you used to frig yourself in the reformatory
you are as bad as them downstairs to think of me with a cock
I'd like to see you with one
what you do not mean
oh
it is only human nature after all
oh some they like it this way
and some they like it that
the lady dips a curtsey
and the gentleman tips his hat
and some they like'em big and fat
and others neat and small
but whatever you say
it is only human nature after all
last Sunday i went out the park
Just to take the air
i saw a girl upon the swings
and she was pretty fair
i said now shall i give a push
and catch you if you fall
Push on she said
it is only human nature after all
oh some they like a nightingale
and some they like a lark
and some they like a pretty girl
to cover in the dark
and some they like a pansy

and do it the right way Absinthe just coat the class
a friendly tribe to them they would pitch in and start dancing
now this was one of the biggest feats that ever happened during the Mardi Gras in New Orleans
Even when the parades that cost millions of dollars would be coming along if a band of Indians was to come in why the parade would not have anybody there
Everybody would flock to see the Indians
they would dance and they would sing
it is journalism
it is not cheerleading
if we are gonna be true to what we believe
Excuse me this is how the creole fairy folk back home cure their three day stubble
Sazerac
they gotta be kidding
Nobody throws a sazerac
Looking good

Lucy
Lucy

Lucy
Nilo did not drown

there was not a drop of water in his lungs

Lucy is dead Romina
Lagring saw the Ouija board
she said Nilo did not die from drowning
she said Nilo did not die from drowning
and he has a snake bite
i thought it may be the snake from the beach but she said the wound was not from a snake
she said maybe we summoned a spirit
she believes it has something to do with Nilo's death
Ruth
we need help
i thought you called for medical assistance
we do not need a medical team
we do not need a medical team
i spoke with Romina and she said that the spirit of the glass had something to do with the deaths of Nilo and Lucy
lf you want to joke around l'm not in the mood okay
not now
they saw a wound with Nilo and i saw that same wound she described on the arm of Lucy
Like a snake bite
lt's just rashes
what is happening to you
Why do you believe that Romina
how can you explain what happened to Lucy
how can you explain what happened to Lucy
she is broken hearted
she commited suicide due to depression is that hard to believe
Stop it Ruth and rest
Doc
you said she drowned right
yes
but that is impossible there was no water in her lungs not even a drop
lt's impossible she died from drowning
what about her wound
do you know where she got it
at first i thought a snake or some sort of animal bit her
the rashes around the punctured wounds indicate that she has allergic reactions but there was nothing found in the toxicology reports
so you can not explain the death of Lucy
i can not explain it at this time
i can not explain it at this time
Doc
Excuse me
l'm sure Lucy died of natural causes
l'm sure Lucy died of natural causes
or supernatural
so you are saying a spirit is following you
i do not know but what i saw with Nilo and Lucy
i do not know but what i saw with Nilo and Lucy
Wait are you serious Ruth

Nanny

l'm sick and tired of your paranoia
you are doing this to destroy us
for what
what the hell are you afraid of
it happened so fast
Aileen i think the case against you will prosper
it is obvious that she was not in her right mind
there were many witnesses
the girl even admitted that she keeps hearing voices in her head
so we won't have any problem with that

i still have a hearing tomorrow
Let's go

Slowly

here come on
Good morning Mario
Good morning
Good morning
Lagring Romina what can i do for you
we want to ask your advise on what these kids have done
they did not finish the ritual
Corazon told me when she was still alive that the ritual has to be finished
i can feel the spirits among us
it is trapped and cannot get out
they are following you wherever you go because you destroyed the only way for them to go back where they came from
Why am i part of it
i did not even join
a trapped spirit spares no one Romina
Child wife or friend
it will make it is presence felt in any way it can
what do we do
you have to find out who the spirit is
you have to find where the spirit's body is buried
Go to the grave
it is good that you save this you can use it again to call upon it
this is the prescription for your daughter
two times a day and we will monitor the developments
Thank you
lt's okay
what is important is that you survived
lt's a miracle that you are alive
i do not know how i survived it
i wish i died too
do not talk like that
Ruth
Nanny had the same wounds i saw it
we are being haunted one by one even Gino
Believe me Aileen you have to believe me

Ruth what is going on here
Mommy

so we can find out who it is
Aileen is that your bag

Romina

i know where to find her
we have to find her body
here

Right there
do not worry Ruth Aileen and Romina are fixing everything

okay
may God bless you always
do not worry we will take care of you
i hope she recovers
now that you are going to Manila are you ever coming back
i will stay with Aileen for now
you can stay with me as long as you want
Take care okay
Lagring
what is it
where is Romina
she just left for Manila
i fear the worst Lagring
when i found out that it was Magda the snake who was causing the murders i could not believe it
what do you mean
i know the family of Magda
she was called Magda the snake because she was supposedly cursed
Cursed because she had the skin of the snake on her face and hands
but the problem was not only in her appearance but also her brain
she had the mind of a child even as she grew older
Magda the snake
Curse of the snake
i could not believe that she was responsible for the incidents with Romina
so who could it be
do you know who
lt's Melda the twin of Magda
they look very much alike when you cover the affected half of the face of Magda
but their parents found out that she was very evil
she was always in fights envious and imitates people
her evil ways got worse when she noticed that her parents loved her sister with the disorder more than she
Melda actually tried to murder poor Magda many times
what are you doing
i am copying you so we look the same
Come with me
i have something to show you
Melda
Melda
it is coming
it is coming
you have nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere else to go
Until now nobody knows what happened to the twin that night
but Magda the snake was the one who was present when Aileen and Romina did the spirit of the glass again
i understand Lagring but we can not say if only one spirit answered their call
because in life and in death twins are always together
i have to go to the comfort room
okay
Why her
Why did you free her
Magda was not the killer
Magda was not the one imitating
what
who will help us now
Nobody will help us now
what are you talking about Ruth
you have nowhere to run
she is here
Romina look at this
that is Magda the snake
what does this mean
i remember now
when she appears to me sometimes the skin in her arms are clear and sometimes not
Same with her face it is different at times
where is everybody
where is Ruth
Why did you set her free
Nobody can help us now
Nobody can help
RuthWow
what are you working on again

Hey Kyle
it is awful early for you to be so happy in a house you do not live in
he stopped by to take me and Boyd to breakfast
yeah I'd take Kristin out more often but i uh ahem

Eve sweetie you want to bring down your laundry
i can throw a load in before i go to work

i do not like the way you fold the clothes
Rolling clothes takes up a lot less space
Ask anybody on a submarine
i appreciate everything you are doing to help but even with this new promotion and this extra work
i can still take care of my family
oh my God
it is 7 40 microwave time
i am so late
Why are you in such a hurry
you are a geologist
it is not like the rocks are going anywhere
i was up all night working on this presentation

Baby baby
Calm

that is terrible Ed
but i gotta say it is not a big surprise
oh
i am surprised
it was it was doing
a solid business
Solid business
you remember the last time you and i went there

we should see if he is breathing
Well maybe you are right
the crowds have been thinning the past couple of years
Speaking of thinning do not go there Mike all right
i know it is terrible man
it is like your man cave
Everybody needs one
uh morning Ed
hi
the rug guy is here to clean the animal heads
Hey Kyle

the one place where people are not all up in my business
you have no idea how tiring it is
Kyle do this Kyle do that
Kyle for God sake get your act together
i do not do that
Your daughter does
Well good luck with that Kyle
and now in a moment we will hear from Vanessa and her team but first let's review the field studies from the previous year
as we all know the results were disappointing in the first calendar year but by implementing the new Geo software we discovered that the soil samples in areas two five and seven were very promising
that is the good news
however statistically speaking
there may be diminishing returns in continuing to exploit the reserves in the upper basin area
Perhaps we will take a short break
hi
Mike Baxter here
one of the most overlooked aspects of a successful hunting trip is proper camouflage
now i got two guys back here in two different kinds of camouflage
with that background which guy is gonna surprise the deer
See ya Sid
but deer have a sense of smell too
that is why it is important to coat that camouflage with spray
Deer urine
Spray it on there
i asked you to shut your eyes
Did you shut your eyes
i told you to shut your eyes
Hey
hi dad
Hey Mandy
Why do not we take five
Take him downstairs and wash his eyes out
that stuff will burn the skin off a snake
Hey
what is up
i think there is something wrong with my car
what is it doing
um there is this sound and then another sound followed by a third sound
Well that certainly narrows it down
Come take a look for me
yeah let me get my jacket
okay
Hold on
Try to describe the sound you heard
okay first it is like a
Chicka chicka chicka
Bing

Thoonk thoonk thoonk thoonk thoonk thoonk thoonk thoonk
and then like a
Fuh thoomp fuh thoomp
oh now i know what it is
Murphy's barbershop
i know this place
it is right next to my favorite shoe store
yeah it is Ed's favorite hangout and i think they are gonna go out of business so what i am doing is looking at a little marketing campaign to see if i can not save it
i haven't told Ed about it' cause i do not want to get his hopes up
you should totally create a profile at hmmnothanks com
which is what
it is this web site where my friends go to ironically diss on new hangouts
okay
um here
Tell me like three things about Murphy's
it is dark
okay
you mean Vintage atmosphere
it is dated

it smells like old men
Musty chic
Nice spin

you trick people into buying things
we call it marketing
oh and then we had this conference call with the barber dude and dad referred to me as his associate like i was a lawyer or even an attorney
Mandy a lawyer is an attorney

do you know Producer Chung
that immoral guy
he called me today said he is shooting a porn film
and ask if i want to work with him
X rated
will you work with him
no way
such films have bad influence on children
the money is good but you will be locked down upon
yes you will have bad luck for 3 years
then multiple of another 3 years
you are bluffing
if we were willing to do it we would not have stayed here
Sing

you are off
not out catching whores
do not need to
all you perverts are here
how is the movie going
what
Tell us about your project
nothing
what do you mean no
are not we buddies
it is nothing
Just bullshit
i will even do X rated films
do you like plastic watches
it is alike those expensive watches
but it is very cheap only 100
Want one
you sell watches too
he wants me to do an X rated film
he wants me to do an X rated film
it is okay
Chung wants you make an X rated film
you are filmmakers
i was a filmmaker too
but did not work out successfully
there is nothing wrong making porno films
Seven Sex Maniacs starring by tits many years ago
it made the man nosebleed seeing it
yes
do it
you do not mind
do be silly
you just do a good job of it
Right make it more classy and entertaining

Sorry to bother you take your time
OK thank you
a great achievement is
a man make his opportunity'

Hold fast to a dream
i have left home on a summer day
a heavy rain pours on my face
then i find my way
the end
Viva Erotica
how is it
it is good
Really
but
Why the villain has been shot in the public
no one calls the police
i am a cop i must know it better
Also the old man why is he impotent
if he is not impotent
he may not get the sex maniac audience's appeal
the woman too why that stranger rapes her
and she feels good about it
and she is having orgasm
but she is a whore no way
she already got paid why she still sits on the bed
i really do not know what she is waiting for
do i know what this story is all about
Why make films
Why need a camera
Why call camera action and cut
Help do not kill me
do not rape me
Help do not kill me
do not rape me
Let go of the cloth
Hands up
Help
Please raise your hands
Hands up
Cut
do not rape me
can you please put your hands up
Why
no one raise hands like this
i do not think so
Why not
at gunpoint would not you put up your hands
if you do the cloth will fall and expose you more
so you will get a chance to fight back
i won't
i will hide at an angle which is less revealing
if he comes this side i will run this way
if he comes up again
i will move to this corner
or else
i can hide to be bear here
you see
i should have run earlier
Why did i stay on
i can escape using the ladder
Director let's skip the scene
Let's do Chiu's scene first
Miss Mango
you have shot many scenes take a break
i will buy some pears for you OK
Fine
Make sure it is juicy
i am allergic to other fruits
Bitch
Dicky are you alright
Sorry
there is a change
when Chiu points at Mango use the hand held camera
Hand held camera again
Please do not you know
People in the underdeveloped countries when seeing unsteady hand held shots will think there problem with the camera
but it is more motional with a hand held camera
what motion
every shot is hand held
can not you get motion without a hand held camera
Editing can help
if you like it so much you do it
Director i have no time tomorrow i am busy
it is so big
36E
is the hand held hinge ready
it is coming
Lights
Come come over
Light here not on me
where is Sunny
i will look for him
Chiu
we do not need to rehearse
when you really the trolley take off your clothes
then point the gun to the left of the camera
then say
Hands up quiet
Get it
Right side left side
Watch out the bullets
does he know what he is doing
i guess so
Let's try it again
Ready Dicky
Roll it speed
Action
do not move
Shut up
Cut
what the hell are you doing
something wrong with the cover up
Cover up what is this
are we shooting Dumbo
Sorry

Try and take it out
it is easy
Relax or else i can not pull it out
not too hard please
Relax a bit more
it is out
is it my turn yet
you fool me
who fooling you again
that is you
Kui come with me
i won't listen to you anymore
Miss Mango
Wah touched my hand on purpose
be careful when you do a scene with this sex maniac
Really
he was a rich man but lost everything to gambling and women
Even now he is playing an impotent sex maniac
he is well dressed but do not let that fool you
Director if you are not shooting me
i will leave
i do not have much time
Alright
i will do
but we have to adjust the lighting first
how long do i have to wait
a little while Miss Mango
Your turn soon
you look good
Mango
Sugar daddy
Director
Boss
is the shooting on schedule
yes
i do not want to wait a whole day for a short scene
you said there is no nude scenes
but now they have
i won't do it
Fine
Just do what you want
i bought you some fruits go have some
Take a break and have some food
Sing please take her shots first
i know but she refuses to do anything
so what can i do
OK i understand
i will talk to her
i settle it
i am going
i am leaving
after the shooting
let's have some Japanese food later

Thank for your hard work
Director keep up the good work
Listen it will be better to have her in nude more
Let's go
i am leaving now
Start to work

Make it quick
you know i have a date
i am busy either
i have a date too
Come
Roll it
Speed
Action
Help do not kill me
Help do not rape me
Help do not kill me do not rape me
Cut
Good
Too much movement everything's blurred
you can not see Mango in the nude
this is a blue movie
do you know that
i know
it is good that you know
it doesn't have to be artistic like Wong Ka wai but a commercial film like Wong Jing's
if you let me change the cast i will do it
what change cast
no cast there is nothing i can do like them
i just want to have my message in the film
Message
no one's interested in your biography
there is no point in making an art movie
Nonsensical movies are good too
Wong's film still holds the highest box office record in the past years
Let's see the midnight show tonight
then you will understand better
what kind of a movie is this
it is great amazing creative
now you see
how the audience enjoy it swearing laughing
this is it
Damn it
i told you not to see this movie
i thought there were car racing
which movie did you just see
Chinese Torture Chamber Story
any comments
i do not know what it is about
but it is pretty good
i give it a 4 star
Good story see weather we can copy its concept directly
how to copy
Use your brain
Wait here i will check the box office
which movie did you just see
a Streetcar Named no Wheels
how would you grade it
I'd give it a lousy 2 stars
Crap
do not know what it is all about
Damn it it is lucky to get 1 star
the director deserves to be shot
it is so awful
Director Yee is over there
Director Yee stay
any comments on your movies bad reviews
i think everyone has the right to give opinion to choose
someone wants to hit you
any comments
do you feel you have failed as a Director
not in this way
Thanks
you know the box office collection of the sex film
Almost 1 million for one midnight show
but his film is bad
Collected only 7 000 in 24 theatres and 3 of them have no one empty
Look a Streetcar Named no Wheels
a car with no wheel how to drive
it is a definite loss
Who'd want to invest in such artistic bullshit
Cut
not again
Your acting is good but you missing one thing
Someone's left you this time you need to
are you Derek Yee
yes i am Derek Yee
Come on
Come right now
OK
OK ready
Action
Cut
what do you think
is it OK
the best Director Yee
dives to death
Bad reviews to the over budget film
a streetcar named no wheel
his boyfriend finds a new half
all knock him down badly
i can not imagine he'd kill himself
his movies were quite good
that was in the past
last words audience has the right to choose
so the audience chose not to see his movie
is the really Derek Yee
it is amazing
what is it
the box office shot up after his death
Why
it collected 300 000 for the afternoon show
Derek's death made the movie work
Soon it will break Jackie's box office record
so what is good about it
we have lost a talented director
Why so sad
he is not your father
Let's go support him to see his movie tonight
i have complimentary tickets
Really
you pay the dinner
how could he miss it
i have not the talent making movies
i should just quit
you do not need talent
you need hard working
what else can you do
be a football player
Watch the game
i have tried to and like to be
what the hell is the referee doing
it can not be a penalty
it is you to blame now we loose
do not do it if you can not
I'd quit if i were you
Right actually we can win without you
Go away do not waste our time
you are a lousy football player
are you joking
that is no need
Why not
it is the best idea
what is missing from our film
Publicity
Talk of the town about
a naked woman at the temple shooting
Why do not we shoot an X rated scene on the street
it will be a hot news for sure
Let's just do it it will work
no kidding
Take it like you are helping me out
or just help the film
Your past movies weren't that special
the boss may terminate the production any time
Tell me
what will you do if i kill myself
a young director suicide because an asshole producer force him to shoot sex scene on street
Asshole that is a good idea
Set up the camera and no fooling around okay
then ask Wah to fondle Mango's breast
you got it
now go head
Director you better come now
Miss Mango is angry
Call the director right now
where is he
Ask him to come
OK i am coming
Director are you coming
what is matter
she is flaring up
Miss Mango what is the problem
Why did you change the location to the streets
i won't do it
it is not my idea
it is the boss and the producer's
so we changed it
do not worry
i will make you look beautiful in the film
it won't look cheap
i won't let him touch me
okay i will not let him touch you
Just pretend i will stop if he touches you OK
i will just do it on one take only
OK once
Only once i wish too
Pretend
how can it work
no sweat call her out
Alright
what the hell am i doing now
Director
Wah the scene starts when you face her
i know what to do
do not worry
Thanks Wah
Dicky set the camera here
it is better to use a hand held camera
Hand held
Well we have to improvise in this situation
Miss Mango
i will do this only once
OK
Wah are you ready
i will do my best
OK
no rehearsal
Please move back
Camera Dicky
Action
Action
they really do it
Beat it
Good shot
Jesus what are they shooting here
Why are they shooting such thing here
do not block her tits
Damn who is blocking the camera
i quit now
you are bastard
Why they shoot such immoral scene here
Mrs Tsui let's go there is nothing to see
you idiot you said we are just pretend
it is not now everyone has seen my body
i quit now
you think that i enjoy to shoot such thing here
Why are you so fierce
we are from Eastweek Magazine
we are from TVB 60 minutes Plus
Auntie why do not you watch TV
Too much TV tires my eyes
how about listening the radio
no you are busy do not mind me
you are home
Go and chat with your mom
Come here
Lucky i am here
i just saw you on TV News shooting that movie
do not let may know
i did not tell her
i only ask her
Still busy shooting the sex education program
not all women are as open minded as your mom
she is just a girl
if her friends you are doing porn she will feel bad
but when i was young your dad and i watch many good erotic films of H C Lee
they were not bad even though may people criticised him
what is the time
about 8 p m
8 p m
I'd better go
it is hard to get a cab at this hour
Mom
you should spend more time with may
i know
you should go out and have fun too
i am too old to fool around
what is important is that
you are happy and healthy
have a good life
Let me have it
Go back
you must pay attention to the actresses' feet
they always looked dirty in many old movies
Remind them to keep it clean
Bye
where is your mom
she is gone
Why do not we have dinner with her
Go and visit her often
she loves you and likes to be with you
Why you women need care always
what kind of report is that
they just make it up
they are always writing trash
Did you really hit someone
not me is it you
Wrong i only used one hand
i saw Fatty did it
i saw him
he would not be able to stand up if i did it
Director Mango is really quitting
yes she is really angry what shall we do
where is the producer
i tell you
i know it is my fault
i should be blamed
it is my fault for hiring him please do not be mad
i am stupid
it is good that you admit it
yes
Kui help Miss Mango to change
she is OK now the script has been changed
the original has Mango kissing Wah now it is reversed
it is a big difference
you better have it rewritten
the erotic elements should be important than the story
Buddy it is hard to persuade her please help me
do you feel hot
Use some effort
Miss Mango
Wah kiss her like you did just now
you can only kiss my hand and leg understand
no problem
can we start now
Rolling action
more and more ecstasy
Mango flirt with him
Wah kiss her more passionately
Kiss her
yes kiss her
more ecstasy
Miss Mango
Right
Need stronger reaction
Wah more
Kiss lower go ahead
Kiss kiss her toes
more forceful kiss her toes
Kiss it suck it
Right go ahead
Harder
Good
no
it is ticklish
Right
Suck it
Wonderful
Cut
Wait
Chung come here
Come
i think we have to set some base line here
Did you see Wah's reaction
is it Wah's or your based line in question
Wah has no base line
i pay him and he does whatever i say
yes but let's not overdo it
Overdo
it is just kissing toes no big deal
it is hard to convince Mango to do it
what
you want to play me now
it is my fault please calm down
Well let's skip this scene
Again
we have always been passing scenes
Well i will do better in the next take
Wah stop protecting him
so what if he pays you money
no big deal
what money
this is professional etiquette
Etiquette
do not talk about it with me
otherwise you would not as me to shoot on the streets
what are you talking about
you agree to it
what can i say
i had to agree
you told me otherwise the boss will stop it
yes you do not do a good job
if it weren't for me the boss has stopped production already
Your bad directing is to blame
Why'd you say that
yes if you were a good director you past two films would not be flopped
do not insult my movies
you do not have a good reputation before too
for all we know that
no one would help you but me
what help
to start this production
so do you want this production or not
Fine stop it
no problem
i hate making pornography anyway
Alright you said it
OK you quit
Alright
i will do it now
everyone ready
Stand by
what are you waiting for
are you going to direct
do it yourself
Wah light off
OK
Fine
that is it for today
you often said you do not want to do porn
do you know who is really against it
Thank you
what
i did not do anything for you
i am just do what is right
i am just doing what the Director wants
it doesn't mean that you are right or wrong
we have saved your face so what is our next move
will they stop the production Dicky
or just change the Director
Chung had suspended the production for 2 days
the Boss is very angry so what to do
i have not received my second payment
i am worse i have not paid 3 months credit card bills
do not worry i will discuss with Boss tomorrow

Fondle her
Cut
Good
Thanks
yes
Come next time promise
that was great
Call me if you have another good stuff
Sure
Why'd you take my money
you are a filmmaker do not have to be so cheap
Boss Wong i think about it carefully
i think about it carefully
Why do not you fire Chung
without him the film will do much better
Boss i know you are a reasonable person
Your money is hard earned money
if you give me a free hand on this film
i surely will
are you Sing
yes
what is going on
Get in
who are you
i do not know you
Boss
i know you are reasonable so i think
yes if you think the problem is the script why do not you rewrite it
Problem with the script
Chung told me last night
the story is illogical and you want to rest a few days
that is okay
it make sense
but can you tell me about the changes
Want a drink
Water please
no water only ice
do you mind
i will help myself
Actually
i have not
i have not thought
I'd rather tell you when it is ready
Chung tells me you are very artistic
Talented i am sure you think of something
do not worry
Chung said you can
i know you can
Chung i want to tell you
Sorry
Come in
I'd like to tell you
i have called tomorrow's working notice
do it or not it is your choice
i am too old to talk art with you
if you can do it
i will not interfere
Just do not go over budget
i want to see you do a great movie
and not a piece of shit
if you won't do it
let me know sooner
it is you again
how is it going
how is the script
what about you
how is your film
it is on hold something is not quite right
me too
do you know Director Derek Yee
i met him before
Why
i spoke to him the night he committed suicide
Really
he told me he started out as an actor at 17
i was an actor at 17
when i was 27 my teacher told me
the ancient action film is dead
it is better to go and find another job
i was angry to hear that
he started me in this field
10 years later he asked me to quit
those 10 years were for nothing
nothing do not you agree
then one day a director asked me
he said an actor can do something else
Try being a director
i did not know what to do
i told him when i decide to be a director
i will call him
Three years later i called him
because i made my first movie
a Story of Mad Director
so never give up
i confuse if you are such a smart thinker
Why choose to die
i am human i have weaknesses sometimes you will do stupid things
if give me another chance
i will not choose death
Thank you
Come here
no
Come
Chung what is wrong with the flower
no problem
Sunny did you find him
no one answered the phone
so page him again
OK
Director
Sorry i am late

i do not know i will tell you later
Good morning Director
Good morning

have a look at the script first
Dicky i will let Mango sleep here
Action
no
oh do not
Cut
what is the nest shot
Wait
Director what is wrong
Mango although in this scene your faked orgasm will make Wah high
i need you to make it more realistic
how will the audience know it is fake
they will know
you have to act it out well enough to cheat them
then they believe that it can be real enough to arouse Wah get it
i get lost
how to i do that
i am sure you have had sex experience
that is what i need you to do
Think of the best orgasm you have ever had
and act it out
that is what i want
Convince me it is real
do you get it
Let me think about it
OK
Wah
yes Director
Tell me have you experienced
not being able to make love
Haven't you
Once i do not know why
Perhaps i was too nervous it was a long time ago
how did you feel
Very sad
Very sad do you feel shame
no
Just scared
can you act out that feeling again
that feeling okay
i will try
Just give it a try
i will try my best
OK
Let's get ready
Dicky zoom in closer and track slowly on the next shot

Something's different with you today
do i
i have to make a call my pager's beeping
i am buying what do you want to drink
Coke

i am doing aerobics
how about you
you are still angry at me
i am not
Even if i am you won't care
i am the one who is doing all the callings
no i want to call you too
Really
Well i do aerobics
but i can not keep up with them
i am so sad
when are you coming home
Soon
Right after work
You'd better work now
Alright enjoy it
Bye
Excuse me
is not that Director Wong
i like his movies
how can you like his awful movies
i do not think so
what a coincidence
Director Wong you are doing a movie with Stephen Chow
it is a definite blockbuster
Starring by Stephen Chow and Jet Li
it is a breakthrough
it is musical this time
but i am waiting for the Boss's approval
Director Wong no one dares to say no to you
that is not true
Forget it it is just bullshit
my best cinematographer is truly a best cinematographer
i heard you are making pornography now
if so you do not need good techniques but do not make it badly
or else the boss will fire you again
but do not worry we are buddies you can work for me
i can set up another crew and let you be my third unit cinematographer
Why did he talk to you like that
everyone knows he is such an ass hole
Dicky you are worked with him before
my first movie was directed by him
he fired me
he said my lighting is too dark
People want to see the artists but not gloomy stuff
after that no one want to hire me
one more beer
do not drink too much
everyone knows i am the best cinematographer
but a lousy drunken type
OK i will drink with you
i will be the drunken Director tonight OK
so we are the best drunken team right
Bring us the beer
Cheers
be careful
Viva Erotica
3rd Revision
23rd may 1996
it is brighter feels warmer
a lot of Japanese directors started out making porns
you okay
i am alright
this film called Maniacal Family
Directed by the one who did Sumo do Sumo do not
Really
yes i like it
Come on i will show you some more and better
it is here look at this box
See how great his hand held style of shooting
but you can not use this method so often
is not it great
yes it is excellent
See more of it and you will tell what is good and bad
but remember not to rush things
it is enough to be one or two steps ahead of people
and also look at the editing
how he cut in the scenes smoothly
so direct
it is strange
i do not know if i should tell you
Well do not tell me then
Just have a drink
i waited for him all night long last night
i know he was busy
he did not come home
i wanted to page him but i was afraid to bother him
Just do not want to be so troublesome
he has work pressure so do i
he cares only his work
it is hard on me
Leave him then
my husband was a film director too
he was also living in his fantasy world
he did not know how to care for his family or himself
Just like a kid
some of them will never grow up
then it is bad like Sing's father
Look at me you will know
Talk to him about it
Unless he changes you will be unhappy
he won't like it if i tell him
you have thought about it better
i am okay i just need to talk to someone
you settle it between yourselves
no matter what happen when you are free call me
Wah Mango
Director
this scene is when the two of you just met
you like her but she is only interested in the money
you negotiate with her
you have no sympathy for her and just grabbed her grab her leg
Grab her and then
then say your lines
Director please have a look to the camera
OK
you two discuss the scene first
OK
Thank you
Mango was he rude to you the other day
do not be a rumor monger
you are pitching him against me also to the others
i know what you are thinking of
you must be doing the same to me too
i know i was like that before
i have sworn not to gossip anymore
if no gossip
what else is there to do
Why do not you gossip about yourself
Why is it
it is erected and ready
Come
do not you like me anymore
you like someone else
Crazy
Why haven't you touched me for so long
you have not hugged me for a long time
are you tired from making the movie
are you tired
yes i am
Why do not you quit if it is too hard on you
the anti vice officer told me that Mango is very sexy
she has good figure and is prettier than me
you like her
will you leave me for her
will you
you and she
Crazy
Why quit when everything is going smoothly
what the hell is the matter with you
you still do not trust me
you are crazy
Shit
Come on in
do not disturb the neighbor go to sleep now
what is this made of
it is too sticky
it is from egg white
Sticky looks better
if too thin it doesn't look spermy
it makes him look weak this way
it matches his character
Forget it you are supposed to be impotent in this film
Just in this film but not in my real life
i got it
what is this
Sperm
Sperm
Doesn't look like it
it is too sticky
what is it made of
it is the real thing
Really
yes
Sorry because i drank less water lately
it is ready
Wah let's finish the shot we skipped
Relax just position correctly
Mango any problem
Open the door
Cut cut

Luckily you were there or we'd be in trouble
Your colleagues are so nice and friendly
what are you doing
i am leaving
are you crazy why
Did you sleep with her
no i did not
you know who i am talking about
you were afraid when i saw you holding her
you immediately hugged me
that you have never done it to me in public
you were afraid to look at her when taking the picture
1 2 3
is there something wrong
i am sure you fantasized about her
yes i thought about it
i am a man i can not stop myself
so does every man
you are not leaving because of it are you
no i am not
Why then
i can not take it anymore
i am so unhappy with you
we are more like room mates than lovers

Good
Girlfriend problems again

Same to me when i told my wife i will be in a porn film

Let her know and stop her imagination
Papa

Crazy
of course not
hello Boss
yes
i did not expect the set burnt down like this
i know i am to blame it is my fault
i do not know it is happened that bad
do not blame yourself
if it weren't you all the film would have been burnt
you did well
then may i ask you
what
any complimentary tickets for me for your first show
of course you are part of the crew
Really
then my name will be in the credit roll
yes
it is my fault
i did not safe the film properly
no it is not
it is an accident
i should take full responsibility for it
Why are you arguing
Let's shoot again
the set has burnt how to re shoot
i have made up my mind
no listen
do not bother me
i won't invest another cent more
i should have profited if the set weren't destroyed
now you are still asking me to invest more
Damn you
i am a business man not an artist like you
in order to profit the film must be released
all we need just little more to complete it
Sugar Daddy please let us finish the film
Shut up woman
what a big mouth
i am not a fool this film is not releasable
Just edit it whatever is left for the European underground market
Also settle Sunny's case too
Make sure he doesn't complain to the Labour Dept
i won't compensate him
i will settle the last installment
that is great we have all heard it
for payment ask him not me
how can it be you are not paying
what did you say
Just because the triads can be unreasonable
Unreasonable
i am unreasonable so what
Damn you
the worst producer director and crew
you are lucky to have a job
without me you eat shit
Let's go
Get out
Damn your mother
Boss Wong you can insult me but not swearing to my mother
Ok you listen
Damn your
are you alright big brother
Beat him
do not think you can damn with me
i have warned him not to swearing to my mom
but he did what a son of a bitch
what a shit kick
how is it
do you think i am internally injured
Just drink tap water you'd be OK
Go and drink the tap water
his face is so pale
it is better to take to the hospital
no big deal why the hospital
Just give him some Chinese Medicine
Producer what do we do
do not worry i am here
you can kill me but not insult me
he was swearing to my mom it is him to start the fight
but i hit him first it is my fault
i can settle it nicely later
but we must come together and be united to finish the film
what film
you broke the Boss's nose
we are in trouble
he is going to kill us
Whether you can fix this situation or not
Settle our last installment if you want to re shoot
how can you talk about money to me now
i helped you to earn lots of money
do not be calculative
we work hard for the money
we work day and night
a tough job man
you are such a shithead
Calm down have some patience
yeah it is not much
you are good at being a sycophant
you say i am a sycophant
what about sycophant
can not a sycophant be angry
yes i am just an angry sycophant
Sycophant
everything crumbles when chips are down
everyone mistreats me when there is a problem
Please say something
have i told you i wanted to be a football player before
because i admire them
Just think they have to play with or without spectators
they get jeered when they lose
Buddy that is the ball game
you can not score a goal every time you either win or lose
when you do not perform the coach will call you out
you may never get a chance to play anymore
my life before is a joke
i never finish what i have started
i quit halfway on my football career
Halfway through my film
Halfway through on my lovelife
when the fire broke out
i dreamt of winning the film award
when i watched this football match
i realize suddenly
Making movies is similar to football game they need a teamwork
i am glad to have know you you have helped me a lot
i am happy to make this film with you all
Thank you
Bravo
Go to work
we are ready now
Let's do it then
Roll
Action
was that good
not bad right
Thank you
do you remember Chung
he is a director now
Roll action
it was his life long dream
Dicky the cinematographer is now an actor
he was lucky he did the Best Actor Award
but do not get me wrong
it is nominated by the porn industry
Wah and his family emigrated
not Canada but Dongguan China
Well Mango
i met her one day
she is not an actress now
Director
i am not in the film anymore
i think it clearly since i was nude to the audience
Why just nude exclusively to him my buddy yes i have married
he is a vet
See all my babies
they are all like you like playing football
what about my girlfriend and me
we are fine of course
we are together
Forget it
i do not want to end up hating you
i will hate you
Hate me then do not treat me like before
Why
you just pour all your emotions in your movie
what about me
have you ever cared
i do care about you now
if so
i won't make anymore movies
Crazy you are nothing if you won't make movies
Why quit the movies
i love you because you are a filmmaker
i know what is your last question to ask
my feeling after making the porno film
i found out what embarrassed the actors most
which is to be nude in front of people
so if i was the Director i will make sure that all the crew and myself take off our clothes to be ease with the actor
may be they will be more comfortable and act better in the movie
Let's try it
Come
Director everything's ready let's rehearse
Director23 976
Good morning Doctor
Good morning Charles
you are looking splendid
i feel splendid
every day and in every way you are feeling
Better and better
Indeed
Well won't you sit here
would not you like me to
not unless you want to
no
i will be quite comfortable here
Thank you
Doctor i am surprised
oh of course
you quit
Three months ago
you know there was a time when your forgetfulness would have made me feel very rejected
not now hmm
Well a little rejected perhaps
Did you do it intentionally
Why should i do that
Well
i am a patient you consider to be completely rehabilitated on your recommendation soon to appear before the sanity board your reputation on the line
a little test perhaps hmm
not very long ago an obvious trick like that would have sent you into a towering rage
and poor old Clouseau would have silently and passively submitted to another massacre
it is a miracle you were somehow able to keep putting him back together again
Poor old Clouseau
there was a time when i could not even speak his name
and there was also a time when you would joyfully have killed him
yes
i was a sick man was not i
we have come a long way haven't we
and you are not even a little bit bothered when you think of Clouseau
not even a little bit
do you believe me
if you say so
Well i could be lying
you are a good psychiatrist but i may be a better liar
for your sake i hope you are not
Sooner or later you'd run into Clouseau and then back here for life
no more chance of another hearing
Coming here day after day watching you chain smoke into an early grave and knowing on certain mornings you will be particularly morose and testy because you have had another fight with your wife
like this morning
how do you know that
it is the only time you doodle
i keep forgetting you used to be chief inspector of the Surete
and will be again
but Clouseau is chief inspector now
Till the better man comes along
Well in that case
i think Inspector Clouseau had better start looking to his laurels
what
you mean
the board meets at 2 00 this afternoon
this afternoon
if everything goes as i expect it to you will be out of here this afternoon
Thank you
See you at 2 00
Clouseau
now now Doctor
some people would consider your methods most unorthodox
i was just making sure that you are not a better liar than i am a psychiatrist
2 00
Come along
Good
how
Help
Grab hold of this
Pull
Pull on this
Help
Out with the bad air in with the good
Out in
do not look Fiona
Out out
and now the kiss of life
Pervert
Dirty old men
Please there is no need to thank me
Thank you
for saving your life
someone
i was hit on the head
yes you have received a bump upon the head
Beump
what
you said beump
yes i know that
it is a large bump
you could receive a concussion from such a bump
Allow me to assist you
no
i am all right
i am fine
never better
Just a little shaky
Probably the shock of
i mean the surprise of seeing you here again today
Well i received a report from the sanity commission that they were going to review your case today so i thought a few words from me on your behalf
oh God
i mean how generous of you but
Well i am not without influence you know
yes i know that
yes i have become a rather important official in the department
i have heard you are the new chief inspector
yes
yes we made quite a few changes since you went crazy
for the better i am sure
by the way Sergeant Chevalier sends you his kind regards
oh Sergeant Chevalier
Good old Sergeant Chevalier
how is he anyway
Well you know there are leaders and there are followers and i am afraid Sergeant Chevalier will always be a follower no
oh yes
and you my friend Clouseau a leader huh
Always a leader
Onwards and upwards to the top hmm
it is my karma
what
my destiny
oh yes
yes a few more years on the force and i might even be persuaded to run for the public office
you can count on my vote
and you my friend can count on me to do everything in my power to get you out of this place
oh yes
i know how you feel
my hat
Well
are you all right former Chief Inspector
yes
yes i am perfectly all right
See
one moment and i will have you extracted
i am fine
i am perfect
every day and in every way
i am getting better and better
Somewhere over the rainbow
i am afraid that this is just not your day my friend
but it is my day
it is my friend
after three long terrible years it is at last my day
i will not permit repeat not permit anything repeat anything to spoil it
now i will walk you to the gate and i will kiss you good bye and you will drive off in your new car which should rightfully be mine and then i will have my interview with the sanity commission
and they will set me free and then
i will kill you
Kill you
Francois
Start the car
Kill
i will kill him
i want to kill him
i have got to kill him
oh allow me
Cato
Forty winks
it is the phone
the phone is ringing
Relax
i will get it
this is Chief Inspector Clouseau's residence
this is Chief Inspector Clouseau speaking on the phone
what
oh put him on
Good evening Commissioner
how are you
how is Madame and all the little commissioners
i see
Well you can rest assured that i shall take every precaution that is necessary
Thank you Commissioner and good evening
i have just received word that former Chief Inspector Dreyfus has escaped from the insane asylum
for some reason the deputy commissioner thinks that he might try to kill me
Obviously the poor man is crazier than anyone gives him credit for
Nevertheless i am ordered to take every precaution
See that the back and front doors are locked while i slip into my new hunchback disguise
both doors are locked now
who are you
what have you done with Inspector Clouseau
Chief Inspector Clouseau
Fooled you did not i
oh Chief Inspector that is fantastic
if you think this is fantastic wait till you see the full effect with the hump
the bells
they deafen me
Chief Inspector Clouseau
yes this is Chief Inspector Clouseau
who is speaking
my name is Duval
Claude Duval
i have the honor to be chairman of the Jacques Clouseau presentation committee
the presentation committee
for me
for what purpose may i ask
for what purpose you ask
how modest of you
the purpose monsieur is to honor one of the city's most dedicated brave and selfless public servants
you are most generous monsieur
most
yes i must admit i have often wondered considering my years on the force and my numerous accomplishments why recognition was not forthcoming earlier
Absolutely right
Nine years faithful service at the Surete and not as much as a single decoration in all that time
yes that is quite correct
however as you are no doubt aware
i have recently received an important promotion
Really
i have replaced the lunatic Dreyfus as chief inspector
i know and i am sure Paris sleeps the more safely because of the change
you are very most kind
but i can assure you when it comes to matters of keeping the peace
i am always on my toes
Chief Inspector
one moment please
can not you see that i am on the phone
oh yes Commissioner
Fortunately there was sufficient air still left in my hump to keep me afloat until the rescue
yes
Well thank you very much Commissioner
Good bye
that was the commissioner
he was most concerned
Well you have been very very lucky you know
yes i know
Poor Cato will be in the hospital for weeks
do you know what kind of a bomb it was
the exploding kind
Mark my words Francois
Sinister forces are at work
and this mad bomber must be apprehended at all costs
Make sure you issue an all points bulletin immediately
yes sir
what about my clothes
oh Sergeant Chauvin is rounding some up for you
while you are waiting perhaps you will sign the order to transport Jean Tournier to prison
Tournier the bank robber
i shall be happy to sign that order
Ah it is life for you this time Tournier
at last we are rid of you
i have to go to the toilet
all right
Thank you
all right Tournier
that is long enough
now this is my plan
Step number one
i will recruit the world's greatest criminal minds
Step number two
i will build an organization so sinister so powerful by comparison the Cosa Nostra will seem like the Vienna Boys Choir
here is the list
but half of these men are in prison
we will get them out
Impossible
i will bet you 20 million francs it is not
where would i get 20 million francs
i thought you'd ask that
Step number three
next Thursday at precisely 2 00 p
M you and six men will enter the main branch of the Paris credit bank
this afternoon at approximately five minutes to 5 00 three men dressed in building maintenance uniforms entered and robbed the Paris credit bank
the leader has been identified as Jean Tournier
how much did they get
Millions
here is the report
all right
that will be all Francois
Thank you
Twenty million francs
and now the next step
Hugo Fassbender and his daughter have been kidnapped
Professor Fassbender
yes
Paris has a theory
they are sending over their top man a Chief Inspector Clouseau
he just sent this telegram
Arrived Gatwick Airport B R 121 12 38 p m
yes
who are you
Jarvis sir
and what is it you do
i am the butler
Ah the butler
yes yes
can you tell me where you were on the night of the kidnapping
Asleep in my room sir
Asleep in your room
can you prove that
no
Make a note of that Sergeant Yard
Tell the staff to assemble in the drawing room
i will interview them in a few moments
yes sir
what was your name again
Jarvis
Jarvis that is right
Perhaps you will be kind enough to show me around the house
Very good sir
i suggest we start with the upstairs
this is the upstairs sir
yes i know that
this is a door
yes that is a door
yes i know that
it is not locked sir
Obviously
Stay where you are
i prefer to handle this alone
is there anybody hiding there in the dark
nothing like a good warm up when you are on a case you know
Tell me which switch did you use to turn on the lights
the light switch sir
Strange
it did not work for me
yes
Unless i miss my guess this would be the gymnasium room
yes sir
yes
it is a good room
yes
this reminds me of my younger days at the Surete police academy
the parallel bars my speciality
i was something of an athlete you know
yes yes
i was known as the Pavlova of the parallels
oh yes
yes it is all coming back now
yes i remember it
Well that felt good
Well now
i expect you are all wondering why i asked you here
it is obvious that the knight that wore that suit did not last very long
yes yes
i know
now
yes
as i was saying
you were saying you supposed we were all wondering why you called us
Look
there is no need for you to speak unless i ask you a question
what is your name
i am Shork the gardener
and what is it you do
i am the gardener
Why did not you say that in the first place
i did
do not be funny with me monsieur
this is a very serious matter and everyone in this room is under the suspicions
Reum
what
what was that
you said Reum
yes i know that
and there is a very good chance that someone in this room knows more about the murder than he is telling
Murder
what was that you said
i said murder
what murder
Well i do not know
you said murder
i said murder
you said murder
no i said murder because you said murder
i said murder
you said someone in this room knows more about the murder than he is telling
now listen
what was your name
Shork
the cook
Gardener
now we are getting somewhere
you
oh dear
are you all right Mr Stutterstutt
who is this man
he is Mr Stutterstutt
i see and what is your job Mr Stuckerstuff
he is the beekeeper
i am not asking you
i am asking Mr Stuffsucker
what is that
what is he saying to you
what
what was that
he says he is got a bit of a cold and he is lost his voice
Lost his voice
a beekeeper who has lost his voice a cook who thinks he is a gardener and a witness to a murder
oh yes
it is obvious to my trained eye that there is much more going on here than meets the ear
before you are dismissed Mr Stiffsticker
i suggest you count your bees
you may find that one of them is missing
you ruined that piano
what is the price of one piano compared to the terrible crime that has been committed here
but that is a priceless Steinway
not anymore
what is your name
Mrs Leverlilly
Mrs Loveliver
i would take a shrewd guess that you are the housekeeper right
i have been with Professor Fassbender for 30 years
that would account for your exaggerated hysteria over a simple blemish on the furniture
Blemish
Whatever has happened to the piano can easily be repaired
what has happened to Professor Fassbender and his daughter is another matter
and it is my job to bring the guilty party or parties to their justice
now then what do we know
one
that Professor Fassbender and his daughter have been kidnapped
two
someone has kidnapped them
Three
my hand is on fire
Drummond what is going on
Good afternoon sir
Inspector Clouseau has been interrogating the staff
Inspector Clouseau Superintendent Quinlan
oh Inspector
Superintendent
Why do not you just tell Potters that he is incompetent and request that he be taken off the case
because we have got enough trouble with France without suggesting that their greatest detective is a fool
Steady
where is he now
he is shadowing the Fassbender farm
hello sailor
yes
who are you
Chuck
who are you
what is that
i am Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau of the Surete
how exciting
i think i will just take a look around
yes
Well you will have to make use of the bar first or take a table
the show starts in a few minutes
in that case i will take the table
Right
Follow me Jock
Jacques
Jack
Ladies and gentlemen once again it is my profound pleasure to introduce the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis
what is a queen
without a castle
you are right
no queen at all
and you'd be right again to say
the winter's day
is cold
Till you
Come
Until you love me
i always will be wanting
this need i need
can come from only
you
Until you love me
i will live a life of longing
for that is the next best thing
i can do
no way of knowing
which way you are heart is going
to go
i do not think you know
Take as long as it takes
Your love
to grow
Until you love me
not one dream can come true
in all my dreams
there is a place
for you
and so i will keep those dreams
Until
you love me
Too
Why is it that this afternoon you are Jarvis the Fassbender butler and tonight you are
Inspector before you get all
Madame or monsieur i must warn you
you had better watch your step
something wrong Ainsley
of course not Bruno
no the inspector was just warning me that i had to watch my step
you see back in France he is known as king of the tango
Tango
oh I'd love to
the kidnappers are here
Kidnappers
okay
Let's go
you want to call Paris now
Look at it this way
it can not possibly get any worse
Professor Fassbender
what an honor to have you and your charming daughter as my guests
who the devil are you
Ah yes
who the devil indeed
Come
Sit down
Let us just say for the moment that i am your host and that i will do everything in my power to make your stay here at Mondschien Castle as pleasant as possible
Providing of course that you reciprocate by giving me something that i very much want
and that would be
i am fascinated by your work on time space relationships particularly the vortices of electromagnetic aberrations
i see
and do you work for a particular government or do you expect to sell my discovery to the highest bidder
Neither Professor
nothing so mundane
you and i we are going to join forces Professor
we are going to build the Doomsday Machine and conquer the world
have a sweet
you are mad
Mad
on the contrary every day in every way
i have been getting better and better
Mad
was Hannibal mad
or Alexander
Surely Napoleon was the maddest of them all
Mad
we shall see Professor
i shall tell you nothing
i think you will
i will die first
Show Miss Fassbender to the schoolroom
Daddy
what are you going to do
something so very very painful so hideous your father will have no choice but to cooperate
all right
i will tell you anything
the Wolverines certainly have to put some points on the scoreboard
i am sure that Green will come out throwing
he is got to get that ball down deep into Navy territory
Green now on third down
Looks to the left throws it
all right team
Let's go
Throw's complete to Rhodes
he is inside the 15
he is to the 20
the clock is running down
can the Wolverines do it
what happened
where is the game
who is that
hello there
he is on every station
Well call the F C C
Hold it
he is saying something
Mr President everybody calm down
Calm down hell
this is an emergen
an emergency
Did Michigan score
Please let's hear what the fellow has to say
it is little enough to ask the life of one man against a holocaust that could destroy the globe
what the hell's he talking about
Quiet
that is why i say again give me Clouseau
and we can all sleep secure in bed
what is a Clouseau
and so next week
i shall give the world a demonstration of the awesome power i hold
on Saturday October 9th at precisely 3 00 p m
Eastern Standard Time the United Nations building
will vanish from the face of the earth
and the gun goes off
the game is over
Call the F B i the C i a and the Pentagon
Find out who won the game
that is a photograph taken by an American news photographer while the broadcast was in progress
Paris has identified him as one Charles Dreyfus former chief inspector of the Surete
you are joking
and more recently an inmate at the state facility for the criminally insane
Until he escaped
here is a text of his speech
he obviously controls equipment sophisticated enough to pirate the satellite
Give me Clouseau and we can all sleep secure in our beds
Thought that might interest you
that is one crazy chief inspector talking about another crazy chief inspector
what does he mean anyway
Give me Clouseau
Listen to this
little enough to ask the life of one man against a holocaust that could destroy the globe
you missed the best bit
Look
he also threatens to make the U N building disappear
Operation Looking Glass
Fassbender
Give me Lovell
Home Office
where is Clouseau
i have no idea
now ladies and gentlemen once again the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis
Monsieur Jarvis
Sir the coroner's report
Ah yes
it is amazing
Even after he had been stabbed twice he was still able to break the kidnapper's neck
Ah pity
yes he had a lovely voice
i meant pity that the kidnapper's dead
we might have got something from him
i did get something out of him
what
what is that
a clue
Clue
what
you said a clue
yes
a brochure clue advertising the Oktoberfest in Munich
it begins the day after tomorrow
and you think the dead man was planning to go there perhaps to meet someone
yes
Perhaps to meet the lunatic Dreyfus
at one time partners in the war against crime now archenemies
you will need help
i prefer to do this alone
yes but if Dreyfus is what we suspect he probably has an army behind him
of course it won't be easy but nothing worthwhile ever is
that is why i have always failed where others have succeeded
for me the greater the odds the greater the challenge
and as always i accept the challenge
Well i am off to Munich
most ingenious
the old closet ploy
i really must congratulate you
if there is one thing i do enjoy it is a good closet ploy
Well until we meet again and the case is solved
the case is solved
Four minutes
we are gonna look like a bunch of Dipsy Doodles if this is a hoax
Well we would look very foolish if we did not take every precaution and it turned out not to be a hoax
Dr Fassbender and Operation Looking Glass are certainly no hoax
God
a weapon like that in the hands of a crazy Frenchman
you are certain
you can do it
Theoretically yes
for your daughter's sake i hope so
Ah the dreams i had
all the terrible things i was going to do to that sweet child if you failed
Look i have done everything you asked
not yet
when the U N building vanishes then you will have done everything i asked
what do you suppose they will call the crater
the Dreyfus Ditch
there should be no crater
no crater
but i want a crater
i want wreckage twisted metal
something the world will not forget
they will not forget today
they won't
Wonderful
i have to tinkle again
do not do anything till i get back
Too late
the countdown started
one minute
Thirty seconds
Seven six five four three two one
Ignition
Today the U N building
Tomorrow who knows
i think by now that the nations of the world are aware of the the awesome power which i control a power so great if i choose i could wipe out an entire city
after all what is the life of a man compared to the destruction of a whole city
i give you seven days
Seven days
okay
Well done
so now we wait
all this to get one cop
but we have some of the finest hit men here in Europe
in this very room
Why do not we take care of it ourselves
because you would not stand a chance
Come on
you do not know Clouseau
he can not be that good
Good
he is not good
he is terrible
he is the worst
there is not any man like him anywhere in the world
Compared to Clouseau this Doomsday Machine is just a water pistol
that is why it will take all the great nations with all of their trained assassins and all of their sophisticated murder weapons to eliminate Clouseau
Taxi please
this gentleman
what are you doing
that is my case
Lucky for you i am in a hurry
otherwise you would have been arrested
and when it comes to the matter of eliminating Clouseau nobody wants to have anybody else get the credit for it
it is a matter of national pride
i think we all agree Mr President that we simply cannot afford to allow any other country to get hold of Fassbender's machine
Crazy or not anyone who has gone to the lengths that Dreyfus has in order to eliminate one man it is reasonable to assume that Dreyfus will smile very kindly on the one who eliminates Inspector Clouseau
i think that is pretty far fetched
Mr President if i told you one week ago that the U N building would disappear and that a certified lunatic would blackmail the entire
you made your point
what do we do
Well Mr President Clouseau is in Munich
i ordered one of our top people to Munich yesterday
Yesterday
Well just in case
he is just reported in
Clouseau has gone to the Oktoberfest
i wonder if we have enough time before the others act
Germany's already acted and bungled it
According to the latest code transmission twelve countries have got their top assassins in Munich and they are all converging on the Oktoberfest
my God it will be like a shooting gallery
Try one of my pretzels
they are good
what are you doing to this poor motherless child
you great big bully
there there little boy
Sir
i better call the President
you know what time it is
he wants me to call
Put me in Coach
what is the score
yes
it is okay
how many
Twenty six Mr President
Holy cow
no wonder Dreyfus wants that Clouseau killed
he is a one man army
who is left
Just the Russian and the Egyptian
my key please
127 please
Good evening Inspector Clouseau
i could not sleep and i just happened to be in the neighborhood
i hope you do not mind
you Frenchmen are so romantic
Thank heaven
for little girls
Swine maid
oh forgive me darling
i have just washed my hands
they must have been freezing
Freezing
yes
something wrong
Wrong
oh no
what could be wrong
then come back to bed
yes of course
into the bed you know
and take off those so silly pajamas
you may rest assured you will never see these so silly pajamas again
that i can assure you
Darling
yes i won't be a moment darling
Hurry darling
i am just going to take a bath
a bath
Excuse me
yes
hello this is Chief Inspector Clouseau
there is a beautiful woman in my bed and a dead man in my bath
if you are going to take a bath i want to take one with you
Darling it is freezing out here
Let me in
Madame
i arrest you for the murder of the man in this bathtub
what
and i must warn you that anything you say will be taken down and used in evidence against me you
who is he
i do not know
he looks familiar
he looks like you
Looks like me
Tournier the bank robber
what is he doing in your bathtub dressed up like you
it is a question i could very easily ask you
but he has been shot and i do not carry a gun
Obviously not no
i am Olga Berriossiva
Until one hour ago i was a loyal Russian agent under direct order from the presidium to kill you
to kill me
i was considered a perfect liquidator because no man had ever been able to involve me emotionally until tonight
do you think that you could fall in love with an ex Russian agent
Well of course everything is possible yes
but you are not the same
huh
oh well of course dead men in bathtubs have been known to make quite a difference you know
anyway this is the man who can lead me to the lunatic Dreyfus who it is my sworn duty to apprehend
i too had a sworn duty but i have forsaken it become traitor given up everything for you
with me it is the duty that comes first
oh make an exception just this once
i wish that i could
you can
i guarantee it
no you see i
Look
what
that tattoo
when i arrested Tournier he did not have that tattoo
it looks like the Mondschien crest
Mondschien
Mm hmm
what is that
an infamous family who ruled Bavaria in the 15th century
i read somewhere that the Mondschien Castle had recently been sold
you read somewhere that they had sold the castle
Fancy them selling the castle just like that
the castle
yes
Dreyfus
he is in the castle
Farewell
i am off to Mondschien Castle
must be getting a cavity
when can my daughter and i leave
when Clouseau is no more perhaps
i have done everything you asked
you have done everything i have asked so far but i have not asked everything
what you mean is that you have no intention of letting us go
you plan to continue your reign of terror whether Clouseau is eliminated or not
i must admit the thought had occurred to me
you are mad
and you are redundant Professor
Redundant and fallacious
Madness does not preclude achievement
you cannot operate the machine without me
not yet but when you have taught me
and if i refuse to teach you
then i would have to take the matter up with your charming daughter
what kind of a man are you
a madman
you said so yourself
Boss
it is true
when
this morning in his hotel room
he is dead
he is dead in his hotel bedroom
Hurray
i am free
oh i am so happy Professor
i am so
Good day
my name is Professor Guy Gabroir medieval castle authority from Marseilles
Tell me do you have a room
i do not know what a reum is
Ah

Pull it

Please give me something to put me out
Put you out

that will ruin the whole effect of the anesthetic on the eyes
you want me to hold it like that
Hold it like that on the eyes while i get some
Please hurry Doctor
i can not stand the pain
yes
Coming soon
what are you doing
Just rearranging the furniture in order to give you the full effect of the anesthetic
Doctor i am in agony
not for much longer
that was hell down there
what is wrong
Whoever built this house put the stairs in the wrong place
do you mean you fell down the stairs
i was preoccupied with the anesthetic you know
it is really hot in here is not it
now the anesthetic
Nitrous oxide
what is that
that is the anesthetic you know
oh good
yes it is good yes
Please Doctor the pain is getting worse
Please hurry up
a few whiffs of this and you won't feel a thing

then why are you laughing
i do not know
Why are you laughing
because i can not help it
yes
i love it
Come on

Your whole face has changed

MR BRlGHT over speakers
Welcome drivers
we hope you enjoyed the on screen entertainment
we realize it hasn'  t been updated in some time
Dad
Dad wake up
in any case congratulations on making it this far
Dad
Tonight one of you will be rewarded with a special advantage a little something we call a Jump Start
the Jump Start Challenge is an opportunity to gain a huge lead over your competition
we use the word opportunity because winning is not guaranteed
you have to earn it this involves risk
however if you can meet the challenge you will be able to skip the current checkpoint and head directly to the next one
this could earn you a distance advantage of up to 700 miles and get you that much closer to the final finish line
Tonight'  s Jump Start Challenge will be awarded to the one among you with the most improved overall ranking
to the victors go the spoils and the envy of your rivals
Congratulations Mr Alex Tully
Check your race phone for your challenge point

Alex
Don'  t do it

this Jump Start let'  s not do it
Let'  s take the group clue instead
are you joking p after what it took to get here you think I'  d pass u an advantage if it'  s offered
it won'  t be an advantage
you think these people give gifts s There'  s gonna be a catch there'  s always a catch
and if there'  a chance it brings me 700 miles closer to Kathryn I'  il risk it
We'  re already in the lead let'  s just concentrate on staying there
Right
we wouldn'  t wan t to gettoofar ahead would we Corinna y you think I'  m trying to keep you from the finish line
Well let'  s just sa
i understand you'  re not exactl y in this thing to win it
so maybe it'  s not i n your best interest for it to be over too quick
or maybe i want to see you stay alive
oh you'  re concerne d for my safety
yeah

Roughly the time you savedmylife

how far will you go
how deep is your love
Can'  t stop the world
Can'  t stop desire

some days you seem so far
i don'  t know what i was thinking
I'  ve been gone too long
CORlNNA
Carrolton
Sweetwater should be just past that
a hundred miles in the opposite direction of everyone else
It'  s a shortcut
Right
you think we should turn around
do you care
Just making conversation
a hundred miles is nothing
Especially at this speed
It'  s not much of a shortcut if you get pulled over though is it
chuckles
you think we'  re going too fast
no
i think you'  re trying to lose our tail
Recognize the car
how could i forget
you don'  t seem worried
should i be
You'  ve outrun him before
i got a better idea this time
Hey nice ride
Thanks
Did you wire it or just jack it
Kind of hard to follow someone out here isn'  t it
yeah it'  s pretty rural
not a whole lot of room to ghost
Winston it'  s over
Let'  s just turn back
are you driving
are you driving
Look i wasn'  t ying to sneak up on you
I'  m coming to you straigh t with a proposal
a proposal
yeah
you cut us in on your chip right now and you get to cash in later when we get the ups
Meantime we join forces you turn your biggest threat into your strongest asset
or
chuckles
or we just follow your ass and take what we need
Sold
Damn
horns honking
laughs
i knew there was a reason i chose you and not him
you thought about choosing him
Well i saw his file too back in Key West
Winston Salazar he just got out of prison
i don'  t know who his partner is though
what was he in for
Armed robbery
so you never really seriouslyconsidered him
Well you weren'  t drivingthisbefore
Well i am now
tires squealing horns honking
we made it
Did i say we'  d make it
yes several times
and we did didn'  t we
yes we did
Probably helped that this address came over the race phone before we ended up in Tennessee
Looks like we missed a party
Let'  s hope they'  re in hotels nursing hangovers
i don'  t know looks to me like we might have missed something
Very astute Miss Barnthouse
Youhavemissed something
yeah i know we got here last we get a penalty
Boo hoo
do we have to eliminate someone'  Cause I'  d like to nomina te a certain Ivy Chitty
Your challenge was to get here by sunset yesterday
you didn'  t
You'  ve been eliminated
what
We'  re out of the race
the finish line has moved ahead which means you can'  t cross it which means you can'  t continue
I'  m afraid you'  re done
but you called us on the phone
you told us to come here
we did
we need to get our phone back
may i have it please
no
no no no no no no no no no
i understand your disappointment
no you don'  t
you got any idea what we had to go through to get here
I'  il spare you the details of the hostage situation and the four bullets that found their way into my tires and the tire world with no tires and the Preston'  s drive thru where they left the meat out of my double meat burger
we got through all of that and do you know why
because God told me we would
That'  s right
he said you are going to persevere
he said you are going to thrive
he said you are going to triumph
God was wrong
Susan
i heard a voice
you understand
a voice that was strong and clear and true
it said you are going to win this race
and you expect me to disregard that and listen to the little squeak from a man in a suit
the phone please
It'  s been a pleasure
Good travels
Surrender America
God i hate these things
These little puzzles
Clever little puzzles
Make me want to hit somebody you know what i mean
Hey mamasan I'  m talking to you
Hmm
I'  m sorry
It'  s just
i keep thinking about Sammy
you said Sam is fine
you said Sam'  s in a safe house
That'  s a house that'  s safe
See
now can we get back to the business at hand
We'  re chasing after 32 million missy
Come home with a handful of that and little Satchel'  s going to remember you believe me
Right
okay
um
Surrender America
Well there is a town not too far from where i live called Dull Ohio
What'  s your point
some towns have funny names and maybe Surrender is one of those
yes
Right
that is why we'  re gonna win this race
That'  s why all those other teams better just watch out
Teamwork
That'  s what'  s gonna give us edge
Surrender America
Stop saying that
It'  s the clue baby
we have to think about it
I'  il think about it afte r i check in with the base
Look for a landline
Rob we made such good time to the last checkpoint
Let'  s at least try to figure it out know we'  re going in the right direction before we start
Gas station

Specialist Robert Laird sir
313th Field Artillery Regiment
Nice of you to check in Laird
i saw the news sir
the casualties from the 100th Brigade Support Battalion in Anbar
i haven'  t heard anything from anybody in my unit
Well not many guys are making personal calls from Fallujah
Sir
you heard me right
Your unit shipped out two weeks ago
Th that can'  t um
i don'  t understand sir
Well it'  s simple son
Your unit got deployment orders
all personnel save yourself reported for duty at the base
this is the first I'  ve heard about that sir
Well that'  s just kind of hard to believe
We'  ve made multiple attempts trying to reach you by phone and by mail
Fact two MPs went out to your house the other day
Apparently the neighbors told them you and your wife left in a hurry a few days before
Hell of a coincidence wouldn'  t you say
yeah
yeah i admit that'  s uh it'  s hard to explain
Look I'  m just a few hours from Fort Benning sir
I'  il report for duty immediately
Report for duty
Specialist Laird are you a complete idiot
You'  re AWOL
you will immediately report to Fort Benning to transfer to Fort Monroe to stand trial at a court martial
Am i making myself perfectly clear
yes sir
and if you cannot arrange transportation we sure as hell will arrange it for you
There'  s no need sir
horns honking
Well we tried
Made a pretty good effort i think
and you know i believe we would'  ve won this thing if Ivy wouldn'  t have been so you know evil
and you were something back there
that whole God'  s talking to me thing
that was good
i half believed it myself
It'  s true
Hmm
Meant what i said Leigh
God has been talking to me
since Katrina
you mean metaphorically right
you felt a presence comforting you in moments of need
no i mean I'  ve heard a voice
Clear as a bell
It'  s God speaking to me
I'  m sure of it

you think I'  m crazy
no
a little
it started in the storm
i had 15 sick people in my care
levee waters halfway up the stairs
i didn'  t know what to do
Suddenly there was this beautiful voice in my head
it said they will help you
then i met you and Ivy
and when we got the phone it said
you are going to win this race

we can'  t quit
We'  re leaving
what
we still have time to catch up
we drive straight through no stopping
Straight through to where
It'  s too late for that
we don'  t even know where the next checkpoint is
i am not robbing this bank
It'  s not like we have to take any money
Alex that metal box holds the answer that can jump us ahead of hundreds of other
you were right back at the drive in when you said we shouldn'  t take this challenge
you were right and i was wrong
yeah but that'  s when i thought they were gonna have us do something crazy
this is nothing
nothing
this is nothing
what did you think they were going to ask us to do
something hard
Look you need to winthis thing to get your wife back
you know that they know that and i know that too
now we can do this
you have experience with this kind of thing
i have experience sitting in a car outside the bank watching the street waiting for everything to go wrong
all right
i was the wheelman that'  s all
Fine then you be the wheelman and I'  il be the bank robber
chortles Don'  t laugh
we can do this
It'  s not you
you can'  t rob a ban k with two people
It'  s amateur hour
what about three
Three at least
Preferably four
so you'  re saying if we find two more people who say did have experience in armed robbery we could pull this off
We'  re never gonna catch up now
Stop your bitching and start working out that clue
you work it out
not doing you any more favors
Aw what'  s wrong
little Sean ito upset huh
you want to call Daddy and make it all better for you
you know what
Why don'  t you call him
Sounds like you'  re the one with Daddy issues
i ain'  t got issues homes
do i look white to you
oh you don'  t owe him anything
you owe me bro
if not gratitude then a little respect
and if we'  re gonna be partners in this then you owe me a listen when i say things like trying to chase a 426 horsepower V 8 is a waste of time
Man he just got lucky fool
Thing'  s all show and no go
if the shoe was on the other foot forget it man
he would'  ve never bee n able to catch this beast
what was that thing you said about cashing in your chips again
you in the mood for a little bank robbery
LElGH
God is not gonna get us back into a secret illegal road race
He'  s got better things to do
Just one sign
how about the sign that says vacancy
Susan please i haven'  t slept in i don'  t know how long
i haven'  t changed my clothes
i have moss growing on my teeth
Let'  s just stop okay
SUSAN
Hah
Hang on
tires screeching
Hah
oh my God where did they come from
Arkansas honey but where they come from is not the point
we know where they'  re going
you can'  t just quit
now turn around
Sam'  s in danger
if you make me turn around you might as well shoot me
I'  m not gonna be any good at this now
you weren'  t any good at it before
yes
Exactly
you could do much better
what do you wantmefor
uh look whose car we'  re in
what am i supposed to do Wendy
Just hitch to the finish line
okay
okay
Y you need cash

Credit cards too

Turn it around
We'  re going to Surrender America
i don'  t know where that is
you can have the car
what
I'  il give it to you
you can drop me off
I'  il get to hi m some other way
Shut up and quit slowing down
instead of 16 million you get the whole 32 million
Isn'  t that nice
i can'  t drive
i don'  t know how
ROB
you lie to me one more time Ellie
i swear to God I'  m gonna get out of this car and you'  re never gonna see me again
the letters from the army the calls
you ripped them up and you erased them
Why Ellie
i was scared
of what
that you were gonna die of what i was gonna go through waiting to hear if you died
Couldn'  t do it Rob
i just couldn'  t
i don'  t believe it I'  m sorry
do you have any idea what kind of trouble I'  m in right now
huh
Just tell them it was me
I'  il take the blame
oh yeah
yeah that'  s good
I'  m sorry I'  m AWOL Captain
my wife ripped up the letters
you think they'  d believe that
Why not
do you know what the punishment is for deserting in wartime
Execution
Death
yeah that'  s right Ellie
Thanks to you i could die a lot sooner than i would have in Iraq
it doesn'  t have to be that way Rob
What'  s tha t supposed to mean
there are things we can do
we can stay in the race
no
no 32 million buys us a lot of options
we can get new identities
Did you hear me
i said no
Move out of the country
Set up some place the army'  s never gonna find you
Ellie how could you say that
if i d
if i do that that makes me a a coward
and I'  m a deserter
would you want to be with a man like that
if he'  s alive you bet your ass i would
i would rather be with that man than the widow of some fake hero dead in the desert
Rob let go
Give me the phone
Here'  s your damn race
We'  re going to win this race
WlNSTON
Listen up
all right here'  s how we roll
we hit hard and fast dominate from the door no warning
Grab the manager pop the vault in and out six minutes
someone even looks like they want to play hero
I'  il personally pimp slap that twinkle right out of their eye
WOMAN
Wintergreen chai latte no foam
That'  s me
Pimp slap
Let'  s just hear him out
i think I'  ve heard enough
There'  s no way in hell we'  re taking this ban k in broad daylight
Wasn'  t my idea
Shut up
what wasn'  t his idea
sighs
We'  re thinkin g this whole
stick'  em up approac h probably not the best way to go
Unless you want a federal manhunt dogging us all the way to the finish line
Too many witnesses
what you think I'  m stupid
We'  re gonna wear masks
oh
Masks
Well why didn'  t you say so in the first place
you got some in your trunk right
or do you mean we should buy some
they gotta sell ski masks in Sweetwater right
Whatever man
we can just go right in
Look we do this at night or we don'  t do this at all
Well i got news for you bro
the bank'  s locked at night and there'  s an alarm
the door alarm'  s old
It'  s cheap
It'  s an easy bypass
Right but the vault'  s supposed to be new and it'  s gonna be locked too
Guys
It'  s locked right now
so we get the manager to unlock it
if you put a gun to his head
if he thinks we put a gun to his head
Nobody'  s gonna get hurt bro
yeah I'  ve hear d that line before
it usually precedes a couple of dead bodies
oh would you try to keep it down
SEAN
Appomattox
what
Checkpoint
It'  s where everyone else is going
the courthouse in Appomattox where General Lee turned over the Confederate army to Grant
he surrendered America
That'  s reall y great Sean
It'  s a couple hundred mile s too late but thanks
Right now we'  re trying t o jump past everyone else so we need to crack this vault not the Kentucky clue
Virginia
Whatever
and you don'  t have to crack the vault
you say the manager opened it with a six digit code on a keypad
That'  s right
that means all you need is the password which is probably sitting on the manager'  s computer
Maybe he changes it every week or every other week but it'  s always six numbers
so the only thing you have to crack are his files and then run a match case auditor search for a six digit alphanumeric
what
we gonna do this or not
you can'  t just say that'  s all a big coincidence
i can and i do
Seeing the Firebird
Finding the phone
Luck
it could'  ve happened to anybody
Just because we can'  t see a pattern Leigh doesn'  t mean one doesn'  t exist
Maybe it'  s too big for us to see
and meeting Ivy
Hmm
was that a part of God'  s plan
Hey even the Garden of Eden had a snake
Come on now
Surrender America
does that mean anything to you
no
Why don'  t you ask your friend you know the big guy upstairs
Hey
Don'  t mock
he gave us a phone
we had a phone before Susan
they took it away
They'  re gonna take this one away too
you are going to win this Leigh
That'  s what the voice said
Come on
Race or not it'  s a beautiful day
we got the sun and the open road and a Civil War historical marker every ten miles
These people do love their Confederacy
which is another reason why we need to turn around and
Surrender
Surrender
Appomattox
what
where Lee surrendered to Grant
That'  s the finish line
laughing

See now was that a coincidence

Try not to stare
and best of all i brought you a new friend
i call her snowflake because she is soft and delicate
i thought you might like it if i read you a night night story

Suddenly and without warning danger strikes

Mary we have to talk

Mary i want everything to go back to the way it was before i killed your fish
i am afraid that is going to take some time
i know what it means to lose something that you care about and what i did was very very wrong
Why do you have a dog
Well i went to the pet store to buy you some new fish and i saw this cute little guy
oh Dick i can not take care of a dog
if you can love a fish you can love a dog
Well he is kind of cute
Come here boy
oh look at him
he loves you Mary www tvsubtitles netwe wanted to believe
we want to call out
on August 20th and September 5th 1977 two spacecraft were launched from the Kennedy Space Center Florida
they were called Voyager
each one carries a message
i send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet
we step out from our solar system into the universe seekings only
the gold plate recorded detecting images music and sound of our planet arranged that so maybe understood if ever intercepted by a technologically mature extraterrestrial civilisation
hello from the children of the planet Earth 13 years after launch Voyager one pass the orbit of the planet Neptun essenciently leave our solar system
within that time there were no further message were sent nor or any planned
we want to listen an October 12th 1992 NASA iniatiated high resolution microwave survey a decade long search by radio telescope scanner 10 million frecuencies for any transmission by extraterrestial intelligence
less than one year later 1st turn the bad Senator Richard Bryan successfully champion in amendment which terminated the project
i want to believe but the tools have been taken away
the X Files has been shut down
they closed our eyes
our voices has been silenced
our ears now deaf to the round of extreme possibilities
Bach's Brandenburg Concerto no

i send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet

Peace and friendship to teach

it is advantages to begin an autopsy was removal the cranium
the cranium is opened with a horizontal division an inch above the eyebrow ridges
something wrong
what this man imagined his dreams
who he love saw heard remembered
what he feared
Somehow it is all locked in this small mass of tissue and fluid
are you OK Agent Scully
you kind of sounded a little spooky
Good afternoon Agent Mulder
Four dollars for the first hour parking is criminal
which is you got better at least 45 minutes
you know Mulder from
from back there you look like him
him
Deep Throat
he is dead Scully
i attended his funeral in Angleton through eight power binocular from a distance of 1 000 yards away
now the picture frame was turned down
you wanted to talk
what have you found
i wanted to talk but i haven't found anything
is dangerous for us to stand a little chat Scully
we must assume we are being watched
i haven't seen any indication
no of course not
These people are the best
i have taken all the necessary precautions
i have double back over my track to make sure that they have'nt been followed
no one has ever followed me
the X Files have been terminated Mulder
we have been re assigned
what makes do you think you they care about us anymore anyway
so why you have bother to come here covertly
because i realized that this is the only way that you would see me
so what do you want
to know that you alright
Mulder you pass me the day within a foot but you were miles away
i am on electronic surveillance
White bread cases bank fraud insurance fraud healthcare swindles
Mulder i know that you feel frustrated
that without the bureau resources it is impossible for you to continue
no it
for what then
when the bureau first shut us down you said that you will go on for as long as the truth is out there
but i no longer feel that from you
have you have'nt been to San Diego
yeah
Did you check the Palomar Observatory
no
from 1948 until recently it was the largest telescope in the world
the idea indesign came from brilliant wealthy astronomer named George Ellery Hale
Actually the idea was presented to Hale while he was playing billiards
an elf climb to his window and told him to get the money from the Rockefeller Foundation for telescope
and you worried that the all your life is seeing the elf
in my case
little green man
but Mulder during the time in the X Files you have seen so much
that is just the point
Seeing is not enough
i should have something to hold on to
some solid evidence
i learned that from you
Your sister abduction you held into that
i am beginning to wonder if if that ever even happened
Mulder even if George Hale only saw the elf in his mind the telescope still got built
do not give up
and the next time we need out in open
she had erased a conversation between President Nixon and HR Haldeman while transcribing the tape
Woods testified that she erased only about five minutes but the tape contained an 18 minute gap
Under investigation
Scout HR Haldeman reiterated the White House explanation that Woods
do we have to watch this Fox
Leave it i am watching the Magician at nine

Bach's Brandenburg Concerto no

Senator Matheson
do you know this Fox
it is Bach
Brandenburg Concerto no
3
two
Good thing it was not a Double Jeopardy question
do you know the significance of this piece
Well recalling music appreciation with Professor Ganz Bach had a genius for polyphonic
this is the first selection of music on the Voyager spacecraft
the first
Four and a half billion years from now when the sun exhausts its fuel and swells to engulf the Earth this expression will still be out there
Travelling for four and a half billion years
that is if it is not intercepted first
Imagine Fox if another civilisation out there were to hear this
they will think what a wonderful place the earth is must be
i would wanted this to be first contact with another life form
i know i let you down
you have supported me at great risk to your reputation
i realise that when they shut us down there was nothing you could do
all i can say is i think we were close
to what
i do not know
what
do you like Bach Mulder
i live for Bach
then let's hear it again
i take it you are familiar with the High Resolution Microwave Survey
the search for extraterrestial radio signal they shut it down
you have to go to radio telescope at Arecibo Puerto Rico
i will try to delay them as long as i can
but my guess is you will have at least 24 hours
after that i can no longer hold off the Blue Beret UFO Retrieval Team
and they been authorised to display terminal force
what am i looking for
Contact
when were you last seen Agent Mulder
Yesterday
where
in the bull pen hallway
Did you speak with him
no is he in some kind of trouble
Agent Mulder failed to appear at his assignment this morning
his whereabouts are unknown
Sir i volunteer my time to assist any search no Agent Scully the bureau can handle
she doesn't know where he is
how can you be so sure
because if she knew she would not so worried about him
i do not smoke
she find him
Gracias

Looks like a self test the computer does
Damn

it looks like the Wow signal
the Wow signal
Ohio State has a radio telescope that conducts searches for extraterrestrial intelligence
in August 1977 my buddy Jerry Ehman found a transmission on a printout like this
he was so excited he wrote Wow in the margins
what was there
Signal
30 times stronger than galactic background noise
Came through on 21 cm frequency which no satellite transmitter allowed to use
the signal was intermittent like Morse code
and more importantly the signal seemed to turn itself on while in the telescope's beam
the Wow signal is the best evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence
but this
this is better
where did you get this
Maybe you can tell me
is that from Ohio state
can not tell
there are a few nickel and dime SETI projects around
UC Berkeley has one
the Planetary Society has one at Harvard and in Argentina in Harvard and Argentina
NASA was working out of Goldstone in California and Arecibo in Puerto Rico
Mulder
this signal from 06 30 Tuesday the narrow band and matching of the antenna pattern indicates that it originated from beyond lunar distance
the same message is transmitted
no
Jorge do not touch the red button
Noho on the rojo
Thanks
the same message was transmitted four hours later on a wide band which puts its point of origin very close just miles away from
i send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet
we step out from our solar system
we have emerged from our global

although i am not a qualify in the pathologist i will record my observations of the body in case at some future time decomposition should obscure forensic evidence
the subject perhaps victim is Hispanic male undetermined age
there are no overt external injuries apparent
there are no indications of any lightning strikes
no sizzling of the hair or burn of any kind
there were no
there are no puncture wounds due to needles or probes commonly associated with the case alien abduction
the subject was discovered in a sitting position rigor mortis having set in although less than half an hour had elapsed
the skin is strikingly affected by goose flesh
the body shows signs of intense cadaveric spasm
the expression reflects
oh my God Scully
it is as if he was frightened to death
Again Scully there is nothing but evidence
and again no evidence at all
the printouts of received transmission indicate contact with another life form
which is i can not see it
and even if i could see them would they really be there
how do i know this could be a classified military satellite these transmissions are from the Voyager for a god sake
could extraterrestrials really have intercepted them
or is this just some elaborate joke played on those who want to believe
i send here by one of those people
Deep Throat says Trust no one
that is hard Scully
Suspecting everyone everything
it wears you down
you even begin to doubt what you know is the truth
before i could only trust myself
now i can only trust you
and they have taken you away from me
my life up to this point has been about the need to see her again
to see them
but what would i do if they really came
Deep Throat said Trust no one
Trust
no
one
'I send here by one of those people'
Trust
no
one
'Deep Throat says Trust no one'
no
Mulder

Mulder its Scully
Dana Scully
Did you know where you are
they came Scully
the ones that took her they were here
here
or here
on the tape
the tape
Evidence proof
the transmissions
it is all here
Proof of what
Contact
These print out
it is here
and the man
we will have to examine the body
there will be more proof
is that them
no this is not it
it is the Blue Beret Crash Retrieval Team
they will kill us
Help me with the body
we do not have time
Help me
Mulder we are never gonna be able to get the body out of the country
Mulde we have to go
Evidence is worthless if you are dead
Let's go
Hold your fire
Get the truck to the bottom of the hill
Move

Mulder
Damn it
you left your off site setup
another brick agent had to cover your ass
the entire surveillance all the months of work on this case gone
Just like you gone
this has fourbagger all over it Mulder
Censure transfer suspension probation
i undderstand that leaving my assignment warrants disciplinary action
and i am willing to accept those measures
but
but i had enough on that survillence to arrest suspects after three days
i could've nailed them on 40 counts of bank fraud
but you left me there
i am surprising you did not notice i was gone
Let alone wiretap my phone an illegal procedure without a court order
Your time is over
and you leave with nothing
and you leave with nothing
i said get the hell out
Report back to your assignment
a minute ago i was a fourbagger
do you want me to make the arrests
i think we need more to go on
Continue the surveillance
it should be right here
Entire tape is blank
an electrical surge during the storm may have degaussed everything erasing the entire tape
you still have nothing
i may have not the X Files Scully
but i still have more work
i still have you
i still have a myself
what is the difference between a lap dance and a table dance
a lap dance they are all over you
a lap dance costs what

Dancing to the tune of lightening
Dancing with a rhythm
with anklets on their feet
These moments should not be lost
Color the world with new colors
Color the world with new colors
Color the world with new colors

with the burden of fragrance
the wind is slow
the fluttering butterflies
Carrying the fragrance of flowers
the rain is melodic
there is a zing in the atmosphere
Let it stay

Ball
Ball

Binu pass it to me
Pass it
Binu

here
Binu
half my salary is used for the house rent
I'd asked him to wait for a month
Sure he will listen to you
you are
what about your salary
Did you get anything
no
Master said he will give it on Monday
Why on Monday
he doesn't intend to give it
as far as possible he wants to block our payments
where were you
ls this the time to come home
I'd asked you to come at 6 other'clock
it is 6 30pm now
lf you roam around this way you won't get food
i send you to such an expensive school
what do you think
Your parents pluck out money instead of tea leaves
you do not care for my hard work at all
i have told you so many times to study and become a doctor or an engineer and get away from this stricken life
but you do not want to listen
Why are you getting so angry
Why are you standing here
Pick up a book and start studying
Come on
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
Rimzim from today you must eat early and sleep early
from tomorrow school is at 8am
i hope you remember
otherwise you will go in the afternoon as usual and school might have closed down by then
i won't give it
you do not write with a pencil you eat it
Khoki
Take this box to the post office immediately
Post office
i will waste half a day going down and coming back up the hill
my work Forget that
this is more important
the tea specimen must be sent to Mumbai
the people in Mumbai will then send it to America
this is the address in Mumbai and here is the money
Register it
okay
Register it
Bring back the receipt properly
Come on go
Go immediately
Go
where were you
Everybody took money and went away
Go to the office quickly
there
yes
Come
you took really long
where were you
have you eaten
or will you eat with me
Give me the money sir
i am in a hurry
do not worry about the money
Alright
i will increase your salary
Rs 100 per day
are you happy
where will you go in the heat
it is cool here
Take a nap
Take care of yourself
Your hands have become dry
Give me the money sir
i am in a hurry
you do not understand
Everybody has a right to a luxurious life
you too
Come
Leave me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
you rogue
Leave
Leave me
Kalyani
Kalyani
Kalyani what happened
you rogue
i will cut you into pieces
you won't dare to touch my wife
i will shoot you before that
i can get a gun too
it is easily available
i will kill you
Throw him out
he and his wife should not be seen here from tomorrow
to hell with your job
Leave me
Scoundrel
there is no point
what is the use going to the police
those rogues will say she was playing a charade
so she was thrown out
how can anybody lie in such a way
we are married
we live a respectable life
Everybody knows it
they will say you are her pimp and put you into prison
it is easy to say so
one world is created by the Almighty and the other by these
People in uniforms
and in our police station there are only people from other cities
they should be thrown out of here
Why do you differentiating Vishnu
a man's destiny takes him places
one is the birth place and the other is the work place
both are like our parents
there is no bias
our nationality is the same
who says so
when we go to their cities do not they throw us out
or do they let us stay there lovingly
they are not bothered about having the same nationality
Everybody is selfish
Outsiders do not care what is happening here
they make money here and send it to their native place
we too must think of our own people
i will arrange a job for you with a monthly salary of Rs 5000
Look i am sensible enough to understand that the job which pays Rs 5000 to a person like me is not a decent job
it is futile talking to you
Vishnu
Bani i do not think Vishnu is working in an appropriate place
Take care
Brother
Please take some money
no thanks
it will be difficult until you get a new job
Return it later
there is a surplus of money in your house
i realized it when i saw cream in the tea
Bye
so what is the news
the news is that God is busy dancing in heaven and he is unaware of what is happening in this world
a tractor factory was coming up
but the leaders and terrorists everybody is evil
they closed it down
be patient
something will come up
Serve the food
Whatever was left i served it to the children
i thought you'd bring rice
i forgot
i was fuzzy ever since i left the factory
Binu
Go to uncle Kurmi's and bring 2kg of rice
Father he asks for money

hello Uncle
Papa told me to get 2kg rice
that would be Rs 20

Father has asked you to add it in our account
i have been doing that for quite a while now
he is been telling me since three weeks that he will get a job sooner or later
no luck until now
lf your father doesn't get a job for the rest of his life should i provide food for his family
he should at least pay Rs 100 or Rs 200
Look until i get some money i won't give you any food grains
Understood

you are still standing here
i am asking you for the last time Uncle
i won't come empty handed henceforth
and father will get a job next week
Vishnu pack 2kg rice for the kid

Vishnu

Vishnu take back the grocery from him

Tell your father to make small pieces of them
Take this
God bless you
Why did not you help your mother
Why did not you come back when she called you
you are always avoiding work
do not you have any responsibilities
my daughter also helps her mother
you just know how to eat play and sleep
that is it
Right
you are not a kid anymore
at your age I'd have to carry rocks for making roads
i have been explaining to you since long
Why do not you understand
Why do not you understand
are you a dim wit
or a fool
do not you have any shame
Why do you scold the kid all the time
Son go freshen up and do your homework
Go on
do not kick it away
everyone is out to ruin me
will i get tea
Rimjhim
yes Mother
Take tea from there and give it to papa
there is no sugar in it
what is this for
Take this
this sugar is for the Lord
the priest has entrusted it to me
lf we use it Lord Shiva will punish us
Rimjhim
yes Mother
Give him this sugar
here
i can not even pay the fees
Added to that there is ration and other things to be bought
i wonder how we will survive this month
' Brother how will i go to school tomorrow'
I'd saved Rs 100 and kept it under the sari in the box
should i use it
are you crazy
have you lost your mind
Remember Rimjhim was unwell during'Bihu' festival
we spent all the money then
how can we still have that money
you do not know what you are saying
' Wear my slippers'
you are hard working
you are very dedicated
i am confident you will surely get a job
' Teacher scolds me a lot
she won't take me in her class'
to hell with hard work and dedication
' Tell her that you have hurt your leg'
' i can not wear my shoes'
i feel like destroying everything
it is no use
Work very hard everyday
Live for 60 years
and then die
' i will punch you in the stomach'
' you lost my shoes and then you tell me to lie'
' should i tell papa'
they think i am a goon
nothing happens over here
one can not even run a factory
we can not do anything
' he will go crazy with anger'
' he will beat me up'
' he doesn't have money to buy me new shoes'
Maintain some peace in the house
Enough is happening outside
' so what should i do
i have to go to school in the morning'
' Wear my shoes'
' as it is i go to school in the afternoon'
' after school meet me next to the gate in the lane'
' we will exchange footwear over there'
Come
Come on
they are oversized
i won't wear your shoes
i will fix them right away
are they all right now
Ring a ring a roses
Pocket full of posies
Kids tie your shoelaces firmly before jumping
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
yes that is good
Go back
Come

Take it
1 oh no
she fell down

Ma'am
Father
Father
what happened today
Early in the morning my father fell into the sludge
i was coming to school
he screamed
so i went back
i picked him up
he told me to wash his loincloth
because he has only one loincloth with him
i was washing the loincloth here and he was applying balm there
he said' how will i wear a wet loincloth'
he told me to iron it
i did not have an iron box at home
i brought the iron box from my neighbor ironed the loincloth sent father to work
and then i came to school madam'am
so i got a bit late
Go and sit
Come on let's go
Hurry up
such chaos
last night the minister was shot dead
yes
there were several rounds of firing too
last night I'd to go out for a movie
now the police have closed down all the movie halls
i do not know when all this will end
Brother you reached school on time did not you
were you in time for the national anthem
no i was very late
you will have to come a bit early
Early
i came here running
you did not tell mother did you
i told you i would not tell mother anything so i did not
ls it
but your shoes are so dirty
i feel embarrassed wearing them
this is your latest excuse
Really
Everybody's shoes are so clean in school
Big deal
i will wash them right away
i will make them shine like vanilla ice cream
Punni
where did you keep the matchbox you wretched girl
Ma'am you do not understand anything
she keeps troubling me all the time
Binnu you are dirtying the well water
Go from here
it was a good job
you know what it was
Taking care of dogs
i refused
how would i take care of my kids after taking care of two dogs
you will have to go to the hospital tomorrow
no nothing much
it will be fine
when times are bad nothing works out
how will i manage in the coming days
i do not understand anything
Forget it dear
we will not starve to death
Life is more than just starvation
do not let it get wet
i wanted my kids to succeed in life
so i got carried away and got them admitted in a big school
now where will i get fees for the next six months
i made a mistake
a grave mistake
i got them admitted in a big school
but a father has to do at least this much for his kids is not it
' i can not sing'
' i can not climb up mountains'
Brother Brother
' i can not ride a horse'
' i can not swim'
' i can not cook'
do not worry
have faith in God
do not even talk about that deaf dumb and crippled man
where is he
where is he
what good has he done to us
that Gogai idiot
he is living a lavish life by making us work hard
we are loyal
Concerned about our dignity
but we will die of starvation and poverty
Praying and performing veneration is a fool's charade
God doesn't exist
Neither here nor in the sky
God is just a stone idol
Just a piece of stone
and a piece of stone doesn't do good or bad to anyone
Brother
Brother
Brother
Brother

Money

he used to be out of town weeks on end
Vishnu

Sir i do not know
have you got her brother
Khoki sir is calling you
she is not opening her mouth
you go and explain to her
Sir why do not you understand
she is speaking the truth
how can a woman know the matters of a man
would not they have questioned their husbands before if they could've thought beyond the kitchen
Bullets and guns were found hidden in the house
and she did not know
we have found Rs 70 000 in cash
ln cash
would not she have asked how and where he got them from
i told you the truth i knew
how do i convince you
she is innocent
Sir i climbed the steps of the police station once and my life was ruined forever
i have been begging people for work
People have labelled me as a murderer and a terrorist
i have two kids who are this small
now their lives will also be ruined because of me
God knows how i am going to raise them
Save Bani at least sir
a hungry poor man is like soft wax
you can mould him as you want
he will become a terrorist if you label him as one
then who will be responsible for that sir
Tell me
no government wants us to get ruined
all over the country communities and societies are fighting against the government
but we still have faith in law and order

Like a Jedai
Luke Skywalker the force Star wars you know
Whatever we should set up watches
yeah but is not Captain Fantastic downstairs now
Right
NOOOOOOOOO
what is that humming
must be the guy's cell phone
will you answer it already
Argiri
Come on let's go
what the fuck just happened
what
you all act as if you saw a ghost
we all thought you were a gonner
what are you talking about
i just remembered i forgot the door open
as long as you are ok asshole the rest of us can go to hell
where ou worried that i was dead too Vicky
we all were Argiri
and who are you supposed to be
Trinity
the problem is that you are who you are
Friend of your's Cook
Nope he just sits there and hums
Put it there
you are hurting me
Shut up
you are and you know
i do not know why
i simply transfer the knowledge
it is you that knows
i do not understand a single word
do you speak any Greek
Did you understand that
i waited for 2500 years to finally find you
i was there the last time but back then men had balls you on the other hand
however the prophecy says you know
and i am it is bearer
this is not the first time evil r
you might as well talk to a wall i simply do not understand a word
do not excite yourself
Just saying
the earth split open and forth came a deity of the underworld
the world changed
but few brave ones endured
there was once a time i decided to get married and to settle down with a nice fat wife but then i decided i like my freedom best so i stood the fat bitch up at the church because a woman is a terrible thing when you only have to have one
yes a woman is terrible thing when you only get to have one and you must be naive
yes indeed very naive since there are so many wild cheries from which you can everyday pick
instead of just one woman why not have 12 and just take your everyday pick
if you only pick one woman to please you fucken cockroach
you are going to be a fool
since there are a ton of them to pick
one for each day of the week Blondes brunnetes fat and thin sluts and pruds hookers and queens
yes just one woman is a terrible thing and if you allow your heart to love only one
then my friend you are just naive
since there are a ton of them to pick one for each day of the week
Blondes brunnetes fat and thin sluts and pruds hookers and queens just take your everyday pick
Fool
who is the bigger fool here Cleanthi
him or you for wasting all your bullets on him
it is time i stopped you from polluting this world further with your foul breath lard ass
if it ain't momma's boy
Come on jarhead i will cut your balls off
we have a dancer over here
a proper ballarina
so what
you do not have the balls for it
who is got it now huh
you don't'cause i got it right here
my balls
you fucken asshole
you hit them because you do not have any
i will stake your tongue on this knife
you weren't expecting this eh Cleanthi
so all this time you actually enjoyed getting your ass kicked by me huh
i thought i'd play a little
you are the biggest asshole there is
you think you are any better
Give my kisses to your mooooom
the prophecy spoke of a hero capable of defeating evil on his own
what in Hades is going on in this fucking city state
but the circle of evil has returned and it is time is once more
you know what must be done
5 Hours 16 Min until the bombing
i am gonna lie down a little if our boy has any revelations wake me up
where were you Vakirtzi
you missed the show
where is Olga
Upstairs
yeah upstairs
Why doesn't she come down then
because she is been killed
What't the matter with him
you remember the guy that threw you across the room
are you wounded
it is nothing
Let me look at it Lay off
it is nothing i tell you it is ok
there is blood gushing how is that ok
are there any bandages left
they are here in the kitchen
do not move a muscle'till i return
Time to get moving
4 Hours 25 Min until the bombing that is if we want to get to the ships
what the hell was that
i heard this noise before and i also saw a flash of light reaching up to the sky
and you tell us now
Why did anyone ask me before
that is what he meant the light that is the sign he spoke about
what do you mean
Start making sense man
if we are to catch the ships we must go now
Argiri if you have something to say say it otherwise we should do what the Cook says
can not you all see the signs
do not you understand
you tell me that we should leave
and go where
this is not gonna stop here
this thing has happened before in ancient Greece and the hooded guy came from there to warn us and tell us one thing that we can save ourselves but then we will always look back and wonder if we could've stopped it there
there is a reason for all of this
you have seen what this thing can do
and what about the light vakirtzis saw
and i died twice so far but i am still here
so what is left now
Run
we will soon have no place left to run to
Everybody we have known is dead
what would Meletis do Marina
what about Jenny
Did she die for nothing
i say no this stops here and if we are going to die at least we die fighting
Guys i can not watch you just give up hope like this
Just look at Vicky despite of all this mess she found me her one true love
because she still hasn't lost hope and faith
what are you Vakirtzi say to Olga and what are you Cook gonna say to Mike
that when the moment came you chickened out
Lt Chickenshit Vakirtzis
that doesn't sound becoming of you
i say we go towards the light and if nothing happens ok let's go for coffee to Piraeus and some football at Karaiskakis field
it is not that we have anything to lose
this could very well be our last chance to do any of these things ever again
Well said man
what is wrong
do you hear that
it is the first time Athens has been so silent
it is the silence before the storm
2 Hours 43 Min until the bombing
Hey do not grope the girl
Follow me
what are you staring at
Wowowowowow
Start up that chainsaw already Mr Costas
do you have any idea about repairing engines
Give me a hand over here
in your face cocksucker
Back off you cunts
Cool
how do you like that
what the fuck is this shit
there is something one doesn't see every day
the box
have you ever been fucked by a Greek taxi driver
my cane my cane
in your face you cunt
that is my boy
Meleti
so long Vakirtzi you turned out to be an intrepid lad
Cut yourself shaving
Ok so maybe i lost the girl but at least she stayed in the family besides now we have got to help all these sliced and injured people
i guess we lost the boat that have no idea what is going on 24 seconds until bombing
two things are for granted
1 we are gonna have a lot of work to do from tomorrow 2
we can not count on anyone but us to do it
Outside help always arrives a little too late or not at allCONCERT OF REQUESTS

Word is you killed two ex deputies

a decorated cop decides to kill a man he never met
and stashes the gun at his place and leaves a bloody shirt right around his girlfriend's apartment
Leave the room guys
do not ever question a case in front of anyone else
when i see something hinky i am not gonna keep quiet about it
Hopper's too smart

all killers make mistakes
Even the smart ones especially the smart ones
they all think they are not getting get caught but they always do
so get used to it
Hopper's the guy

so you telling me you were with Hopper all night
he went to bed with me he woke up next me
i do not know how to be any clearer
i appreciate that and i wanna believe you really
you know
when i ran your drivers licence some interesting information came up
that is not relevent
i was hoping you might have learned a few things since 2002 like telling the truth
i said she is done talking to you
this is a homicide investigation
and i am not sure you want her booked as an accessory
she stays
Come on
i thought that went away
how would he know that
they are just bluffing
do not worry about it i took care of it
this is Jared Pryor
he claims he was with Hopper this morning
yeah but we can not talk about it
it is him and me are the same
the same
you know peas in a pod
Flies in the ointment
can you tell us why you and Detective Hopper were at the Santayana club
i can not really say
but if you know who Detweiler working for let me know
Detweiler
who is that
do you know where Hopper is now
Sure
he is looking for the man who is making it today over and over again
we both are
yeah well
Good luck with that
now as my lawyer you have full access to the evidence against me right
Well we are get into that
but first there are a few ground rules
do not talk to anyone about the case
no wives girlfriends that could make them potential witnesses in a trial
and do not talk to the press about anything
do you have a publicist
all right i could recommend one for you
this case is gonna be trialed in the media
Hopper should not have receive the package yet it is important
this hourglass was found next to a dead body
now you got 3 minutes start talking
Tell me about this hourglass
it is from the club
what does that
Shut up
i am asking the questions
who else has one
everyone on the board
what board
i can not tell you if i can not breathe
the Santayana board of directors
every member of the board past and present gets an hourglass when they are voted in
Kind of an inside joke
Keep them from talking too long at meetings
would you mind telling me what is so important about a damn hourglass
it is the second one i have seen just like it
the 1st was sent to me by Garza
but you said you did not know him
i never event met the guy
i do not know why he sent it
but it is evidence in a 15 year old murder case
Isabella Contreras
i think she worked at your club and was killed by one of your members
what has an old murder case have to do with Garza
i do not know but it is all connected to this club
that is why you saw me there i was after this
a list of members
and you suspect them do not you
yeah one or more of these men is a killer
if you are right and i hardly doubt that you are you have narrowed it down to the 400 of the richest most powerful people in the city
how many of them are on the board of the directors
a couple dozen
yes sounds right
who are they
you really want to know
all right
here Robert Diminico
he is the deputy mayor
Winston Wales philantropist
Giselle Mack runs the city art's foundation
Seth Bath
Alex Forasz
here is your friend Garza
Wait
Go back
Forasz
i heard Forasz talking about this this fancy schmaltzy club that he belongs to
Good luck detective
the DA is gonna be pushing hard on this one
Why do not you just let me push back
i will make some calls see how strong that case is
but
next time
no choking
yeah
Hopper
Hey Andrea
i need you to run a check on an Alexander Forasz
See if he has a jacket
Hopper what is going on
there is a board out on you
Robbery homicides
i know
i killed Garza and went after his wife and i did a bunch of bad stuff
how can you be so damn flip about this
because i do not have the time you always end up helping me in the end so could we just skip to that please
i always help you
what am i your secretary
no you are my partner
all right you have to give me a second this hasn't exactly been my easiest day
yeah well you and me both
what was that name again
Forasz
F O R a S Z
Alexander Forasz
okay i have got a hit
but he is clean
not even a parking ticket
what is the hit
he filed a restraining order against some guy named Jared Pryor
i am Jared
is this helping
yeah
do you have an adress for Forasz
i did some asking around it turns out that is Garza's wife
what are you doing
you can not just
that is a witness
you can not just
Rita
Thank you
i know you are in a lot of pain and i am
i am so sorry
but you are wrong about him
what
Brett Hopper could not have killed your husband
he was with me all night
who are you
i am his girlfriend
Alberto was my husband
we were married for twenty two years
i am so sorry
i heard his name first
Your boyfriend
Alberto said it
Hopper
Clear as i am saying it to you
and then i heard
i came downstairs but he was
Alberto was liying there
i saw him
Standing over my husband with a gun
i saw his face
Detective Hopper
Barry Coldburn
we have got problems
can you be a little more specific or is that on my dollar bills
Well to begin they have got the murder weapon with your prints your shirt with Garza's blood on it not to mention the eyewitness Garza's wife
she is lying
it doesn't matter
the prosecution puts the grieving widow on the stand you might as well start planning the menu for your last meal
Look the cops are in on this on all levels
Witnesses lie
lab results get doctored
if you are saying to me an entire system is against you that this is one big conspiracy
let me warn you juries do not take kindly to the C word
i know how this sounds
do you
if you are laying pipe for an insanity defense
that is not what this is
i am being framed
yeah maybe but as your attorney i have to advise you
the evidence against you is extremely compelling
if you want my best advise take a plea
i can probably get you murder Il
that is fifteen to life but no chances of the death penalty
so thanks
Thanks for helping me out
i have to be really careful
Sorry man
okay i confess
i killed Alberto Garza
Alright
no you did not you idiot
where is Detweiler
on the swing set
you have been playing in the wrong park
i know he is answered to somebody at the club is that you
Forget about the Santayana Club
you won't get any answers there
but where am i supposed to look
a little closer to home
Thanks that is helpful
Your old man was on the right track with the girl
my old man
what are you talking about
here smart guy
Figure it out
for the zip ties
who are you guys
Think of us as friends of your father
DAY 3
Somebody's tense
what is wrong
nothing
we went to bed last night and everything was fine
what happened
Did you have a nightmare or something
the worst ever
that is okay
it is just a dream
yeah Jen it is me we need to talk
it is about Dad
i am wondering if you have any of his old stuff
i will call you back later today
Jared
Get in man
Get in
Why are we here
do you know a man named Alexander Forasz
yeah
Maybe
i
i think so
i am not sure
he took a restraining order out against you
yeah well that is because i almost caught him
but he got away
you think he is the one who took my brother
the one that we are looking for
that is the reason we are here
Come on
i can not do this
could you just
you know while i stay here
are you sure
yeah
Alright
yes
LAPD
I'd like to as some questions about a Jared Pryor
you know i have a restraining order against him
yes that is why i am here
Please sir it is important
would you like some coffee detective
Hopper
i thought you might know that
how do you know Jared Pryor
it is complicated
i am sure it is
Did Detweiler introduce you
who
Did you meet to the Santayana Club
a club
how do you know i belong to the club
what did you do to Jared
what did you do with his brother
nothing
who the hell are you
i was his surgeon
his surgeon
Jared was
he was a successful bond trader for one of the largest firm in the whole world until his seizures just got out of control
Seizures
from what
Temporal lobe epilepsy
Jared had one of the worst cases we'd ever seen
it got so drastic he just could not function
we had to perform surgery
Like in brain surgery
yes sir
we saved his life
but there were side effects
Hallucinations black outs even sufferance from hyperactive episodes of dja vu
Dja vu
it is that feeling that you are reliving a moment over and over
yeah
i think i have heard of it
Jared will have multiples episodes of this every day
so he latches on to what is familiar
he will repeat routines he will go to the same place day after day
he will have sudden bursts of memory
that is there is just so much about the brain that we do not understand
Like the memory of his brother
what happen to his brother
Well he died
Cancer more than a year ago but see Jared doesn't remember
as far as he is concerned his brother was alive when he went into surgery and gone when he woke up so
in a sens yeah
i am responsible
i took the memory of his brother away from him and that is why he comes after me
he actually believes that he is a victim of some sort of grand conspiracy and that i am some king of lean leader
how would somebody know if they had this condition
other than the seizures
they
they probably would not but
so
he is not who i thought he was
he want's to talk to you though
he will tell you everything
Did you find my brother
no but Forasz said he will
he will tell you where he is
Thank you
for what
you are the first person that believe in me
the first one that really understood
i have been alone for so long
anyway i owe you an apology
i should not have treated you the way that i did
do not worry about it
we are good
Still i am sorry i bit youPreviously on Enterprise
a parallel universe
According to some theories everything that exists in our universe should also exist there
another Terran Empire
another Starfleet
i am not a slave
you are Vulcan
never forget that
the things a girl will give up for her career
this ship is not only from another universe it is from another time
about 100 years into the future
Imagine the technology we can find on that ship
ours for the taking
Enterprise is under attack
the Tholians can see us
this is the Captain
all hands to escape pods
Abandon ship
Commander
you have got thrusters
Release the docking clamps
i can not
what about weapons
this power grid's a mess
it is gonna take a few minutes
Sir the shields are functional
Raise them
the shields are weakening the clamps but they are still holding
i will alternate port and starboard thrusters
that should shake them loose
we are free
Firing aft thrusters
Six Tholian ships moving towards us
how much longer for weapons
the power couplings have been removed
i do not know if i can bypass them
Sir
Mr Tucker
Stand by
i could use some help over here
when i tell you shunt the plasma to the forward emitters
Three more ships approaching
Just a few more seconds
what was that
they have locked on a tractor beam
we are being pulled back into the dock
it is now or never
Stand by
now
Tactical systems are online
Full thrusters
the remaining ships are retreating
the station's opened fire
does this thing have aft torpedoes
you better believe it
they are armed
Escape pods
Twelve kilometres off the port bow
they are ours
Bring them onboard
we need warp drive
Engineering's been stripped to the bulkheads
but the good news is most of what they took was still sitting in my hangar deck
but i need time to figure out how to put it all back together
how much time
two or three days
Sir i am not even sure what some of these systems are supposed to do
it is like i am Chief Engineer on a steamship coming aboard the first interplanetary transport
if we do not have warp capability in 12 hours
i am going to find a new Chief Engineer
i suggest we make use of the alien workers
they may know something about these systems
Keep them under close surveillance
Once warp drive is restored we will set a course to rendezvous with the assault fleet
we are in no condition for battle
we made quick work of the Tholians
this ship was designed to be operated by a crew of 400
there are only 47 of us
the logical course of action is to take Defiant to Earth allow Starfleet to study it
reverse engineer its systems there is no time
the Empire could lose this war in a matter of weeks if we do not get the Defiant and its weapons to the frontlines
Dismissed
Commander
not you
i should shoot you for betraying me
the orders giving you command of Enterprise were obviously fabricated
it was my duty as a Starfleet officer to help Captain Forrest regain control of his ship
you swore your loyalty to me
you should be aware Captain Forrest ordered me to kill you
Why are you telling me this
Forrest is dead
his orders are no longer valid
you are my commanding officer
i never had a problem with your people
until they became a part of this rebellion
if i had another officer capable of doing your job
I'd show you to the nearest airlock
i need you to get this ship up and running
but if i hear so much as a rumour that you are working behind my back
Understood
Get out
what are you wearing
what are you wearing
i found it in the Captain's wardrobe
These people had some strange ideas about uniforms
i can not find a mention of it anywhere
a mention of what
the Empire
as far as i can tell it doesn't exist in the other universe
no Empire
a lot of the names are the same but their history has been rewritten
instead of building an Empire
Earth became part of an interspecies alliance
the United Federation of Planets
more like a Federation of Fools
what about us
do we exist in this universe
Computer access biographical file
Starfleet Officer Hoshi Sato
Working
Hoshi Sato
Comm Officer on Starfleet's first warp 5 ship
ln her late 30s
she created the linguacode translation matrix
at least she was remembered for something
i can tell you who she married
it even says how you die
Stop
i do not want to know
but this is not you i do not care
Computer display file on Starfleet Officer Jonathan Archer
Working
Son of famed warp specialist Henry Archer
Jonathan was appointed
Captain of Starfleet's first warp 5 ship
his name is among the most recognised in the Federation
he earned an impressive list of commendations during his career
Historians called him
the greatest explorer of the 22nd century
two planets were named after him
Hey
there is nothing great about that man
he sold out Earth's future to a group of subhuman species
Great men are not peacemakers
Great men are conquerors
Forget about him
Your future is just beginning
can you imagine the look on the Emperor's face when he sees this ship
you will be declared hero of the Empire
Starfleet will have to give you a command of your own
i already have a command of my own
what is the problem
Commander somebody pulled both plasma regulators out of these housings
Why are you bothering me with this
they are probably on the hangar deck
no sir you do not understand
they were here 10 minutes ago
i went to get this coupler
when i came back the regulators were gone
You'd better find them because if this junction's not online in 10 minutes
i am gonna tell Archer you are the reason we do not have warp drive
yes
yes sir
who is in here
i found traces of reptilian saliva in the Ensign's wounds
something bit him
the bite radius would suggest a particularly large reptile more than two metres in length
can you find this thing on internal sensors
it is not in the primary hull
Sensors are still off line on the Engineering decks
Perhaps it was a pet owned by one of the original crew
Unless one of them owned a velociraptor i find it extremely unlikely
there is no sign of the regulators
without them we can not initialise the reaction chamber
we are stuck at impulse
Whoever sabotaged us knew exactly which components to steal
the slaves we captured bring one of them to the Briefing Room
Certainly sir
what attacked my crewman
he promised he'd kill us if we told you
i will kill you now if you do not
Please
Stand aside
T'Pol to Major Reed
Bring another prisoner to the Briefing Room
Acknowledged
from what i am told the maximum setting can actually disintegrate a person
i have been looking forward to trying it
his name is Slar
whose name
our slave master
he was in charge of the salvage operation
when you boarded the ship he hid in the service crawlways
he was planning to sabotage the ship
where in the crawlways
Possibly near the power transfer conduits on Deck 22
it is warm there
his species likes it warm
what species
Gorn
he is a Gorn
we had it cornered in turboshaft 3 but it appears to have escaped through this access tube
that is when we lost contact with McKenzie and Browne
they are taking too long
when my ship was in jeopardy i did not let security handle the situation
i took care of it myself
I'd have better luck sending a squad of Tellarites to capture this thing
Put an assault team together
i will lead it myself
Sir i am picking up a signal from inside the ship
i think it is the reptile
can you pinpoint its location
the frequency's scrambled
i want to talk to it
the translator matrix is tied in
this is Captain Archer
Return our plasma regulators now
i want to leave this ship
Give me what i want and we will talk
no
i am familiar with your species
Humans are not trustworthy
you will give me a shuttlecraft
Once i am away from this ship i will tell you where to find the regulators
Once i am away from this ship i will tell you where to find the regulators
this is not a negotiation
the regulators now
if you do not comply i will give the order
he closed the channel
Major get the team together
Your best men
the Gorn's offer is reasonable
he has no intention of returning the regulators
if we give him a shuttle he will contact his people and come back with a warship
without warp drive we will be an easy target
Defeat this Gorn and you will finally earn the respect you deserve
there is a bio sign very faint in access tube 7 alpha near junction 3
i will seal off the bulkhead here
that will leave him with only one escape route
Flush him out drive him into this junction
i will be waiting for him
Understood
Reed to Captain Archer
Go ahead
it is not here
he is modified a communicator to emit a false bio sign
Meet us in Junction 3
Acknowledged
Shut that bloody thing off
it is a trap
i have failed you Captain
Archer to T'Pol
where is it
the Gorn's moved into the primary hull
it is on Deck 9
we are going to Plan B
Access the environmental controls on that deck
Wait for my signal
Acknowledged
Archer to T'Pol
Section Four a on my mark
Standing by
now
Enhancing grav plating
Grav plating's at 20 Gs
Give me your weapon
Defiant Starlog January 18 2155
we have recovered the missing engine components and i have ordered a course to rendezvous with the assault fleet
what is Major Reed's condition
at this point he could go either way
no doubt there will be several discreet celebrations if he should expire
i notice you have been making extensive use of the library database
i was merely researching classical literature
i wanted to compare our major works with their counterparts in the other universe
i skimmed a few of the more celebrated narratives
the stories were similar in some respects but their characters were weak and compassionate
with the exception of Shakespeare of course
from what i could tell his plays were equally grim in both universes
Examine their historical files
you may want to learn more about their Federation
Did you know in the other universe humans and Denobulans are considered equals as are Vulcans
you do not find this interesting
i find it dangerous
if i were the Captain I'd restrict access to that database
i am certain he would not want to give his crew any ideas
Perhaps you should reconsider the repercussions
this is the Captain
all hands to battle stations
Report
Hull breach on B Deck
Emergency bulkheads are engaged
Concentrate your fire on the Andorians
Hull plating's at 32
Admiral there is another vessel approaching
more rebels
no
Direct hits
the Tellarite ship's opened fire
no damage
Lock on their reactor
Fire when ready
Target destroyed
the Vulcan ship's trying to escape
Pursuit course
Captain they are no threat to us
i recommend we
Fire when ready
the last Andorian ship is retreating
Weapons are locked
no
Let them go
i want the other rebels to know what happened here
Get me Admiral Black
Archer
Sorry we are late for the party Admiral
where is Enterprise
is Captain Forrest with you
it is going to take some time to explain sir
Perhaps you'd like to see the Defiant for yourself
a most impressive vessel Commander
with the technology on this ship at our disposal
the rebels won't stand a chance
Glad you agree sir
i intend to recommend that you get your own command at the earliest opportunity
Respectfully sir you have the authority to grant a battlefield promotion
Unfortunately we do not have a ship to give you at the moment
the Defiant
i am sure the Fleet Admiral has other plans for this ship
they are never going to give you this ship you know that
they will tear it apart try to learn its secrets
if you are lucky you will end up commanding a moon shuttle
do not you see what the Admiral's planning
he is going to present this ship to the Emperor himself
he will take all the credit
and you will end up an historical footnote could alter the course of the war
the people of the Earth are in your debt Commander
that is Captain
you are relieved Admiral
our entire assault fleet wiped out by a rebel attack
Thousands of your fellow Starfleet officers dead
if the Defiant hadn't arrived when it did all of you would be among them
and who are we to blame for this
not the brave men and women who gave their lives for the Empire
Criminals who are losing this war are sitting in their comfortable offices back at Starfleet Command
their weakness invited our enemies to strike and their corruption and arrogance have brought the Empire to the brink of defeat
i have been a soldier all my life
and i will not stand by and let these people destroy an empire that has endured for centuries
i ask you all of you to join me
we cannot put down this rebellion so long as our forces are commanded by dishonourable men
before we can defeat the rebels we must defeat them
that ship out there is the key to our victory
with the Defiant on our side there will be nothing to stop us
Enter
it is not wise to make that gesture even behind closed doors
it is agreeable to see you again
Did you review the historical files
the implications are intriguing
Intriguing
this alternate universe is very different from ours
i am not certain a Federation could ever exist here
i thought you were an idealist
that was many years ago
we have to take action
Archer intends to overthrow Starfleet and the Emperor
Archer is right
the Empire has become corrupt
a new leader may change things for the better
not for our people
Weapons on that ship will annihilate the rebels including thousands of Vulcans
we can give them an advantage
how
i can download the data on Defiant's engines and tactical systems
we will give it to them
Data will be of little value
Archer still controls that ship
i am going to destroy that ship
what
i am going to destroy that ship
what
i can disable Defiant's power systems but i will need your help
do you want to spend the rest of your life serving the Empire
i am too old to become a revolutionary
i know Archer
he blames our people for inciting the rebels
if he becomes Emperor he will lay waste to Vulcan
i can not do this without you
my senior officers do not think i can do this
they will come around
T'Pol doesn't approve either i can see it in her eyes
Maybe it is time to get rid of her now that this ship's operational
not just her
we will get rid of all the non Terrans
i will transfer them off Defiant
all of them
the rebels have spies everywhere
i can not afford to have a single alien aboard my flagship
i hope you are not planning on getting sick anytime soon
in case you haven't noticed your Doctor's an alien
i have got nothing against Phlox
his people are not rebels
it is not in their nature
he can stay
i have never been the consort of an Emperor before
is there anything i need to know
i think you have
i think you have got the basics down
Put me through to Fleet Admiral Gardner
Corporal escort Commander T'Pol to Transporter Room 2
Your service aboard this ship is no longer required
Archer what the hell is going on
i take it you received my message
you demanded Starfleet's unconditional surrender
have you lost your mind
you have seen the specs on the Defiant
you know what its weapons can do
i want to speak with Admiral Black
he is not available right now
i suggest you order your forces to stand down
Starfleet can not afford to lose any more ships
this is your only warning Commander
do not approach Earth or you will be fired upon
Bridge to Doctor Phlox
this is Phlox
there is a medical emergency on the Avenger
you are needed immediately
Acknowledged
Neither of you appears to be injured
Sabotage the Defiant
have you lost your senses
you are the only non T erran on the Defiant
any of us would arouse suspicion
you heard Archer's speech
he is delusional
it is not a delusion if the Captain has the power to do what he says
and from what i have seen he most certainly does
i should report you both
are you loyal to the Empire or not
of course i am
Archer plans to kill the Emperor and take his place
Captain has proven himself in battle
Perhaps he should rule the Empire
if Archer fails his crew will have to answer for his crimes
we will be executed
there is an old tradition
if someone saves the Emperor's life it is said there is no request he can refuse him
Consider the possibilities
a medical facility of your own with unlimited resources
you could conduct experiments as you see fit
do not forget the females
Females
you will be able to choose as many concubines as you'd like
if the Emperor were my patient I'd be obligated to save his life
i suppose what you are suggesting is not that different
what is this
Save it Commander
the schematics you downloaded where are they
Schematics
Let's go
i was hoping you'd put up a fight
i am surprised you are not exhausted from all the beds you have jumped into recently
i am surprised you are not exhausted from all the beds you have jumped into recently
Commander Tucker told me i should give you a few pointers in that area
Bring her
Shut down the Turbolifts
Secure the Bridge
who are you working with
i hope you are prepared to die
my death will change nothing
you will not prevail
the Defiant will prevail
it is simply a matter of firepower
the Federation is our future
you are mistaking our universe for someone else's
it may take centuries but humanity will pay for its arrogance
These interruptions are not helping
i need an estimate
the inside of this panel doesn't look anything like the schematic you gave me
you need to remove the duotronic module
the relays are behind it
i have removed the module
you have to disengage the flow regulators before you remove the relays or the plasma will ignite
Someone's trying to override the Bridge lockouts
Doctor you must hurry
Doctor you must hurry
the warp field's fluctuating
it is a power drain
Primary EPS relays
i will alert the Captain
no
Probably just a micro fracture in the conduit
do you really want to interrupt the Captain for that
i will handle it
Take over
yes sir
Take a team aboard Avenger
Confine every alien on that ship
there is no point in continuing
she is not going to talk
we should kill her
you have been looking forward to that for a while haven't you
Archer to the Bridge

they are trying to escape
Photon torpedoes
Lock on to their reactor
before i forget first thing tomorrow i want you to erase the historical database
i do not want anyone else getting any ideas about this Federation of Planets
we will lose all the data on our counterparts
Exactly
it will only take a day for the fleet to return to Earth
do you think the commanders will support you
they are loyal to the Emperor
they do not really care who it is
by the time the fleet arrives the reign of Emperor
Jonathan Archer will have already begun
Once we have put down the rebellion
i will expand the Empire throughout
are you all right
Open a channel to Fleet Admiral Gardner
Channel open
this is the Starship Defiant
if you do not surrender immediately we will begin targeting your cities
Respond
where is Archer
who the hell are you
you are speaking with Empress Sato
Prepare to receive instructionsPreviously on in Treatment

Boys studying the Koran
Sixteen of them dead

Madrasa murderer
Shortly after you complete this mission you work yourself up into a state of extreme exertion
do not you think there is a strong desire there to atone for your actions
you are going back to a place where you dropped a bomb
Your face is on the internet and there is a price on your head
Surprised
i did not think
i did not think you'd come back again
i am back

i have just made a pot
yeah coffee's good
how do you like it

Benj
is that your reaction whenever the coffee is not perfect
is not perfect
Paul this is like attempted murder your coffee
but let me hear your interpretation
it is obvious you have one
not really i
i remember i used to have this patient once and
he would come here and before each session he would say Stop
and then he would pop a pill
and it was just
a ritual
what are you trying to say
Well i think in his particular case what he wanted to show me was his distress and his
his pain
i do not know maybe with the coffee it is
Maybe you are just telling me that you are only gonna come to the therapy under your conditions and anything that you do not like you are gonna spit out right away
do not you think you are being a little traumatic
Come on Paul
Maybe
Why did you come back
i want your advice on another little matter
besides you deserve to know how my trip went
Being that you helped me decide to go
for all the wrong reasons by the way because my visit did not do what it was supposed to
and what was it supposed to do
Let's just go to the chase okay
Saturday morning i am standing near the bomb strike
Just like in London after the Blitz just rubble you know
this area had been hit again and again by us by them by suicide bombers
we hooked up with a Red Cross unit
and they took us to this makeshift hospital
it is a triage unit
there weren't enough doctors to treat everybody
it was chaos
what did you do
i was just watching
you gotta understand in my line of work i am 10 15 000 feet up in the air
Missile locks in on a target by radar on a screen
i do not see people
i just press a button
Just it was kind of crazy to be down there all of a sudden
how did that make you feel
Coming a face to face with the victims
how would it make you feel
Scared
Guilty
See that would be the normal reaction
i knew this should have been the drama of my life but i felt nothing
and then i realized the system did a great job on me
what do you mean the system
Listen there is people down there
Arms and legs missing faces blown off
it is carnage
and the parents are walking around they are waiting to see if their children are gonna live or die all because of what i did
but what can i tell you
to me they look like 200 people standing in line at a pharmacy
Did you feel any connection with them
Did you feel in any way responsible for what they'd suffered
in that moment all i cared about was whether they cheated me or not
i mean the system
the people on the madrasa
it was not any difference than seeing it on TV
the only thing in my mind in that moment was whether the system knew that the buildings near the target's bunker the one that was supposed to get my one ton bomb
if they knew these buildings were full of children
or not as they claim
nothing else mattered
so it was really important for you to know that you had done the right thing
Like you said last week if you hit the target you sleep well
and all those people whose suffering you were responsible for
could you not see them
no i saw them
i felt norhing for them
and then i realized how ingenious that my body has a built in separation mechanism
what does that mean separation
Compartmentalization
i am standing there and all i cared about was whether i made a precise hit
the enemy is a formula
Size of building amount of people multiplied by the amount of explosive divided by 100 equals a number of estimated casualties
you understand
i am standing there and i do not feel anything
i had this friend who died
Four months ago
anyway i
i went to the funeral and
all throughout the service i kept saying to myself Why do not i feel sad
i though to myself
Maybe i did not love him
Maybe i did not care
i tormented myself for about a week
anyway finally
i realized that actually i felt a great deal
Even the fact that i was so busy with my guilty feelings
Even that attests to how much i felt about him
yeah but what are you saying
that i was feeling
but i did not feel what i was felling
i think that you have very very deep feeling about these people
but something strong inside you prevents you from acknowledging those feelings
not just to me or to anybody else
but to yourself
i do not understand what you are saying
i do not get what you are telling me
Feelings are not a philosophy
you either feel or you do not
you can not bullshit about it
you think i am bullshitting
Listen i am paying you 150 bucks for less than an hour and i do not see you making an effort
you are supposed to be smarter than me and i am not feeling that
so we are competing
to see who is is the
who is the smartest
you know Alex i think that here like everywhere else
like with thee coffe for instance you are concerned with what is the best
it must be
it must be difficult
Come on give me a break
it must be kind of frightening for you to feel
empathy with these people
so you create this kind of ultimate reality for yourself with those people where
oh no they were just waiting in line at the pharmacy
i am just the accidental tourist
not the pilot who bombed them
who killed their family
i wish you were right
but it is much more fundamental
if you hold on to this organ called guilt feelings
and i believe that is what it is
it is an organ
Like the spleen or liver
the system will cul it out of you completely
Understand
i have no way of feelling guilt anymore
i do not have the organ
so you really believe it is possible to amputate such an organ
you went back to Iraq
Why was it so important for you to go back
to risk your life just to
Just to be there
i told you i wanted to check if anything was left
and
and i wanted to see what happens when i come down from that top view
but nothing happened
that is right nothing
can we
can we go back for a moment to the site of the bombing
can you describe one moment when you said to yourself
i should be feeling something now right now
and i do not
there was a moment
i do not know if it is what you are looking for
but there was a moment when this old man came over to me
he had been burned
his arm was bandaged
he kept looking at me with a strange little smile
which means i know you
i know you
i ignored him at first but a few minutes later he was back
i know you i know you he kept saying
for a second i thought he recognized me but i did not really believe that
i doubt he'd ever seen the internet but
in some deep intuitive way
he knew
he knew i was the man who dropped the bomb that destroyed the whole street we were standing on
you could be
you could be describing a mystical experience
like a dream
yeah it was like a dream like a totally bizarre dream
he started looking like some old warlock out of a fairy tale or something
he would not leave me alone
he kept pointing at me
i know you
and i looked in his eyes
and he was sort of amused kind of friendly
Like my father looks at me when he thinks i have done something wrong
Like he knows my secrets
Like no matter what i do i can not hide from it
and i was frozen there
and by that time people had gathered and they were watching us
Finally someone from the church group came and pulled me away but that old man he never took his eyes off me
you still think it is too early to talk about your father
Why because he popped into my head for a second
you people
what is it with you people
i give you a little crumb and you lunge at it
i am just asking myself alex what was it about that old man that
makes you think about your father
Let me tell you something
if there is someone who does not know the meaning of guilt it is my father
you know why
because if he could feel he would not have survived
you know my father killed his father with his bare hands
yeah
and that is a fact
Man i'd love to see him on this couch
Man doc you'd have a field day with him
you want to talk about it
oh now i got your attention
i do not think i can tell it as well as he does
but i will try
Mid' 50s right
Jim Crow Oklahoma
my old man had pissed off the local good ol'boys by trying to organize some black labor at this factory
they tried to threaten him but my dad did not back down
he is a tough son of a bitch i will give him that
anyway the whole thing it just escalated
and this mob with hoods attacked his house
my uncle Ronnie was on the front porch with a rifle
they shot him down
Shot my aunt Jeannie too
and then they came inside
my father takes the rest of the family they run downstairs to the boiler room to the basement
Right near the boiler they all crammed into this area this hidden room
my grandfather his father was very sick
Dying of lung cancer
and he had this
Apparently he had this
this wheezing and this hacking cough
so my father puts his hand over his father's mouth and nose and he kept it there while they searched the basement kept it clamped tight
then when they finally cleared out my grandfather was dead
He'd suffocated
there it is
that is
that is a horrific story
Tells it every year on my grandfather's birthday
it is a tradition
and you really believe he doesn't feel guilty about it
i am telling you he always used to say leave the guilt for the white man
we can not afford it
it is possible that he is saying that it is dangerous to feel guilty that it is a kind of weakness
Maybe that is a message that you have grown up with
what can i say
that is just my father's way
but is it your way
i do not know
Hey it works for him
Doesn't necessarily make him an asshole
People love my father
my wife is crazy about him
you should see him at
at family dinners
he is got her off in a corner and telling jokes and
i do not know
she appreciates him
Maybe that is why we lasted as long as we did
you say lasted as if it was past tense
yeah actually that is why i came to see you today
there is this issue with my wife
what happened was when i came home from my trip it was late and the kids were already asleep
and i saw my wife
what do you mean you saw your wife
i looked at her
i really looked at her
she was sleeping in front of the television
for an hour an hour and a half nonstop
i sat there without taking my eyes off her
when was the last time you watched your wife sleep for an hour straight
Well i usually fall asleep before she does
Well try it once you will be surprised
what will surprise me
what you will discover
about her about yourself
i was looking at her
looking at every inch of her body
and i said to myself
who the hell is this woman sleeping on the sofa in front of the tv
what the hell does she know about me
what does she think she knows about me
and what the hell am i doing
living with her
in the same living room in the same house
with the same kids for the past 15 years
Understand
and i am sitting there opposite her right
she doesn't imagine what is going through my head
and you know what happened
she starts grinding her teeth
now it is the first time i ever saw her grind her teeth in her sleep
and i am talking something sick frightening
the sound that came out of her mouth
how do you
you could cut diamonds between her teeth okay
it really fucked me up
Sounds pretty upsetting
Shocking i tell you
and suddenly i understood
for the past 15 years this woman's been so busy pretending that everything's okay flowing
she is a model mother a model wife an outstanding lecturer at a communications college
Very impressive in front of my fellow pilots
and it turns out she takes it all out on her teeth at night
you know that is pretty common actually
they do not think it has anything to do with stress
it has to do with flaws in the structure of the jaw
you really believe that
no it is connected to her stress
in what way
in what
she is a totally repressed person
and all her repressions come out at night in her sleep
so she grinds her teeth
you think Michaela may have trouble with her feelings too
you think i do not feel
Wait till you meet her
everything is just like clockwork
Clockwork that is what
it is clockwork
the kids have been going to bed at the same hour since they were two days old
they got sick on a fixed date
We'd have sex on a fixed date in a fixed position
and Michaela even farts once a year on a fixed date
Once a year on the night after Easter Sunday she farts
she lets herself fart once maybe twice a little one not that much
then it is over
no farting for the rest of the year
Man she is a programmed person
every emotion is under control
Sounds like you are a little angry with her
what
Why
Just the way you talk about her
no
Takes a lot more than michaela's schedule to make me angry
i got the impression before when you were speaking that
Maybe you are a little angry with yourself Alex
i mean you went all the way to Iraq and you could not feel anything
i do not know
Maybe
have you spoken to Michaela about it
of course
over our morning coffee
she says yes honey
i grind my teeth
you only noticed it now
you are such a sweetheart
that is what I'd call love
then she said Baby please cut down on your coffee
Remember what the doctor said
since my heart attack she lets me have one cup of coffee a day
and that battery acid you gave me that is not coffee
that doesn't count
okay
so you do not like Michaela worrying about you treating you like you are sick
it is just
it is like she is on a mission
to get me back up in the air asap
she says i am fit as a fiddle and i need to be knocking on the navy's door to get back
how long has it been since you have flown
two months since my heart attack
it must be hard to be away from that world
not to be part of what used to be the
the center of your life
first of all i am still one of them
so you can relax on that
but mean while sitting at home thinking about the possibility that you
that you might never fly again
of course i will fly again
People with worse injuries have bounced back
do you want to go back Alex
when the time is right
but Michaela's dying for me to go back
and at night she grinds her teeth like some kind of
Alex it is not like she changed overnight
what are you saying
i think there are things about michael that really bother you
because they reflect something inside you that you can not live with
Like what
Like her passion for you to fly again
i am not 100 convinced that you actually want to go back
Maybe because you are having trouble forgiving yourself
okay all of this just reinforces my decision to leave home
what
Why
yeah i do not think
it is pointless to drag this out for years
when a person decides he is not in love with his spouse he should not have to put off leaving home
is not that so
it is over it is dead
i have had friends who have reached this conclusion
they go to 3 years of couples therapy and they end up separating
so what is the use
i say cut that shit
do not you think that is a little extreme
i mean it is possible to overcome a crisis
do you know what i realized
that i was never in love with her
with Michaela
do you know what that means
what a terrible realization that is
what do you expect me to do
Find a lover like my dad
Start coming home late at night
i do not even have a good excuse anymore
i won't do anything but sit on my ass and watch tv
so what
you look upset
no i am just
i am just a little concerned
Well do not be
i feel a great relief
no i am sure
there must be tremendous relief in just walking away
i am not convinced it is the solution
Why not
i suppose because i ask myself
who are you really leaving
Maybe you are leaving her because she is such a frightening reflection of you
Maybe you are leaving yourself not your wife
it is irrelevant
i have no reason to go back
we are finished
we are done
have you said anything to her about it
not yet
i thought i'd consult with you first
is this really a consultation
because you know something
Again i feel like i am a rubber stamp for decision that you have already made
on the contrary this meeting clinched the matter not before
you can take credit for it
Why are you always giving me credit
you know it is not that you give me credit
what you are really doing is you are asking me to accept responsibility for your big decisions
and you know what
it is not me making these decisions it is you
you knew before you walked through that door that you were gonna go back to iraq
you knew before you ever brought up the subject of Michaela's teeth grinding that your marriage was deeply in trouble
These are not conclusions that you have come to here on this couch in the last week with my permission
are not these things that have been boiling over inside you for a very very long time alex
i got to go
Like you say my time is up
Hey do not worry
i will keep you postedthe box you lost has not been opened since the time of Rambaldi
it was rumored to contain the strain of a plague like bio weapon capable of killing millions
this bio weapon what do you know about it
Only that the Covenant refers to it as the Passenger
the ClA wants me executed next week because they believe that i was working with Senator Reed
and i was
but my association with Senator Reed has nothing to do with advancing the Covenant's agenda
2 years ago Senator Reed recruted me to work for an organisation inside the US government
they refer to themselves as the Trust
i need you to prove that this group exists
i was serving my country Jack
not betraying it
in one of his session with Barnett
Sloane admitted having an affair with Irina while you were married
what are you saying
Lauren is Covenant
i can not be sure
the shooter was wearing a wig it was dark
we were wrong about the Passenger
it is not weapon it is a person
i think the Passenger may be your mother
i am looking for the Passenger
i have a great respect for the followers of Rambaldi and i know you to be a truly wise man
but if you do not tell me where to find the Passenger in 5 seconds
i will kill you
i cannot help you Mr Sark
how do you know my name
Retrieve the manuscript regarding the Passenger and i will meet you in Rajasthan
Bring him with you
he may be useful if the manuscript is encrypted
when i mentioned the passenger to your mother she terminated her user account
which means one of two things she is the passenger or she is protecting her
what is going on
Your message said it was important
you were right
about what
Lauren's the mole
she works for the Covenant
you have proof
i should have known
we should talk to Dixon and figure out a way to handle this
oh
i know how to handle this
you will act like nothing has changed
Ok what is plan B cause that is not gonna happen
Given that the Covenant is out of this
in the search for the Passenger tracking Lauren might allow us to catch up
she cannot detect the slightest alteration in your relationship
i will inform Dixon secure the agency
limiting her access to classified documents
Ok stop
my wife betrayed me
she betrayed all of us
you can not expect me to pretend that never happened
i am not sure you have a choice
Why is that
because you are the one that married her
i missed you this morning
i got up early and went to the gym
i should have left you a note
that is fine
in fact i like it
it makes me feel like we have settled back into our lives
yeah i think we have
before my dad died
i asked you if you would come with me to counseling and you said no
i still think it could help
it is just a thought
no i
I'd like that
after 30 years you still live with your wife's betrayal
will he
Absolutely
an Echelon intercept we just received indicates the Covenant has kidnapped someone they believe can help them find the Passenger
a convoy is transporting them across western Rajasthan
you and Vaughn will intercept it and take him into custody
now we do not have the Indian government's cooperation and the airspace is restricted so you are going in old school
we have done well here quite well
Thank you
we have to go
Follow me
Give me your gun
Give me the gun now
here
Press on we have everything we need
they have the Restoration
Passenger is compromised
Just breathe
it is you
the Passenger she is your destiny
how is she my destiny
as a friend as an enemy
Tell me tell me that
is the Passenger my mother
Passenger is
your sister
Alias 3x19 Hourglass
in Nepal the convoy was transporting a man
we tried rescuing him from the Covenant but he was shot
before he died he told me my mother was not the Passenger
he said my sister was
who was this man
a monk a cleric a Rambaldi scholar
Dad what difference does it make
do i have a sister
i do not know
Maybe that is why mom's name was linked to the Passenger
Maybe because she had another child
during our marriage your mother had an affair
if in fact you do have a sister it is conceivable she is the product of that indiscretion
I'd hoped to spare you the name of the person with whom the affair took place but if he is the father of your sister that is no longer possible
who is it
Sydney
Thank God
you have to help me
Your execution cannot come fast enough
i am innocent Sydney
i have not violated my pardon agreement
it was based on my cooperation with an organization known as the Trust
Senator Reed was my contact
if he was the mole i did not know
Ask your father he knows that
if you were innocent he'd find a way to stay your execution
Even though you had an affair with his wife
you know that
i have 72 hours to live
i want you to focus on that not on some affair i had 25 years ago
i am not focusing on the affair
i am focusing on the child that resulted from it a sister i never knew i had
must have come as a shock to you
it did to me when i found out
are you telling me you did not know
no not until 2 years ago while i was in a monastery in Nepal run by followers of Rambaldi
Go on
Sydney the revelation that i had a child it was overwhelming
i spent every possible moment from that day on searching for my child
the Di Regno heart Il Dire
Rambaldi's machine that i so painstakingly constructed
Together they gave me an individual's DNA and the word peace
which in Greek translates into Irina
i did a DNA test to confirm that i was the father of the child
Sydney i created Omnifam
while i was inoculating millions of people against diseases
i was simultaneously able to gain access to medical databases that identified people through their DNA
and i hoped that it would help me find my daughter
i failed
you know she is the Passenger
i know
i know
i also know the Covenant is after her
Sydney i want to protect my child
so please talk to your father
if he is concealing information that would exonerate me because i had an affair with Irina convince him to give it to you
if not for my sake then for your sister's
Ok here is what we found out from Project Blackhole
the Restoration refers to documents written about the Passenger
now that is the bad news
the good news is even though the Covenant has the documents they can not read them
they are in code
yes and we have the only code key
it is a stalemate
not if we are smart about it
here is what we do
you call a briefing making sure to include Lauren
Once she is there you detail the following information
Analysis is currently filtering through some chatter they picked up referencing the Restoration
they are certain it will only be a matter of hours before they can locate these documents
after indicating confidence in our ability to locate and recapture the Restoration we then explain what we will do once we have it
Project Blackhole is delivering the code key today
the minute we come into possession of the Restoration
Marshall will begin the decoding process
in truth Marshall will be receiving a bogus code key
we should also remind Lauren that
Even if we do not recover the documents we know that without this code key the Covenant will not be able to read it
after learning a code key exists it is probable Lauren will try and copy it
that is where you come in
me
you have to act completely normal
Marshall
Lauren
Agent Vaughn
Reed
Mrs Vaughn Reed
hi
what can i do for you
Project Blackhole does not share its toys as often as the NSC would like governmental turf war that kind of thing
when i told them about the code key they insisted i detail it for them
Right
Well go ahead have a look and while you are at it have a gander
not on the Flinkman file
it is just a little journal i am keeping for Mitch
Patent ideas history of quantum mechanics brief intro to string theory basics
the letters here what language is that
that is 4th century Neapolitan Italian
which i love saying because it makes me think of ice cream
Neapolitan ice cream is my favorite
Really
mine too
she is good
i mean if you had to fall in love with someone who was evil
i can see why it was her
you know
not that you are in love with her
Whatever the attraction was originally
Did she take the bait
Well i am not sure but she did take my thumbprint
may i
what are you doing
i am checking to see if there is any use of my biometric access within the Agency
she is in image processing
she must be duplicating the code key
Ok i have left image processing
Well i haven't left because i am here and she is there and
her next step will be to bring the code key to her handler or whoever can use it to read the documents written about the Passenger
you will track her to that location and identify her contact
that should lead us to the location of the documents
at that time we will spec out a mission to recover them
Jack has told us the Passenger is your sister
Hopefully what is written on these documents will give us what we need to find her
Sloane confirmed the child is his
i see
i know how much this upsets you
i am fine
Dad
if Sloane is gonna be executed it should be for a crime he is committed
what exactly are you implying
if you have evidence exonerating him you have to use it
i do not have any evidence
you should go
you know what i want
what
Normal life
here we go
Lauren's mother
Olivia
she is supposed to be in London
i think she just passed her something
can you hear anything
no we are getting interference from that fountain
the Covenant needs you to
oh my God
Hold on i am gonna filter it through the active noise reduction
at least pretend to mourn
i killed your father to protect you
the sound waves are isolated
i am gonna invert them and that should
where are the documents
at home in Richmond
the Covenant wants the complete translations by tomorrow
i will meet you there
Whatever they tell us about the Passenger we should act on immediately
Lauren doesn't trust me
should she trust you
Trust is based on honesty
when i have had problems i have talked to her about them
what i do not trust what worries me is that i feel Michael will leave me once i have mourned the death of my father
if that was true why would i be doing this if it was all fake
i did not say it was fake
Temporary whatever
if that is what it was why would i agree to work on our problems
our problem is that you think you are in love with Sydney
how am i supposed to respond to that
Honestly would be good
Sydney is very important to me
we have history obviously
we are together a lot
we go away together a lot
do the two of you ever go away
never
you maybe should
do you have any trips planned
Lauren's gonna see her mother in Richmond
Only for a day
it is a start
it worked
he is going
hello darling
hi
i am so glad you made it
you two young people are just what this drafty old house needs
Thanks Olivia
it is nice to be here
i will run these upstairs
his being here is unacceptable
i told you i had no choice
we are supposed to be reconciling
you getting a reading
Tapping into the power grid now
the EM sensor i designed should lead us right to it
we will let you know as soon as we find the safe
Copy that
i was just telling mum how great you have been the past few weeks
Lauren's been incredibly strong
how are you
i am doing surprisingly well for a pariah
i never liked politics
you never know who your friends are
at least now that i am the wife of a traitor i know the answer
i have none
Excuse me
hello
the safe is in the study
it is Weiss
he needs help on a brief
you are cold
when i am inside i will get you a sweater
What'd you got
Ok switching back to comms
i am at the safe
Standing by for transmission
Scanning text now
Copy that Boyscout
Receiving data
have you decoded the documents
i haven't had the time
most of that work was supposed to be going on while you were here
you do your work
i can handle him
i wonder
one more page
Ok should be another 30 seconds
Oups
what do you mean oups
Sensor picked up a new EM reading
i think there is somebody else in the house
Vaughn someone is coming
i am almost done
Sweetheart
what are you doing in here
Looking at our wedding pictures
i remembered your parents kept them here
Remember that day
i will go get your sweater
that was the happiest day of my life
mine too
i want to be that happy again
what can i do to make that happen
that is a start
Really
i am sure that is not what it sounds like
not that it sounds like anything because you know there is not any sound
there is probably really not
Turn it off
Sorry
Bad idea to keep it on in the first place
Using the real code key
Marshall was able to decipher the documents Vaughn retrieved from Mrs Reed
they detail a Rambaldi artifact known as the Hourglass
it turns out the Hourglass was only recently sold at auction to a man named Masa Raidon
the guy running yakuza's US shipping business out of San Pedro
yes
now Raidon owns a building in little Tokyo
he is got a nightclub on the ground floor
and there is a personal art gallery on sub level 2
that is where he is holding the Hourglass
but you are gonna have to move quickly
Why is that
According to Rambaldi's manuscript the Hourglass will only reveal the location of the Passenger to one man
her father
Sloane
and he is gonna be dead in 6 hours
this is impossible
Justice has been apprised of Sloane's value in this regard
they refused to stay the execution
if Sloane dies any chance i have of finding my sister dies with him
has it occurred to you that your half sister might be a danger to you
yes of course
but it is equally possible that i can help her
she could be an innocent victim
with Irina Derevko and Arvin Sloane as her parents i do not think so
i requested to look at Senator Reed's personal effects every notebook memo receipt
i know the Trust exists
Dad are you really so bitter that you would sacrifice my sister in order to get payback for a 25 year old affair
Sloane deserves to die
yes he does
but not for this
the director of legal policy at Justice has operational control over Sloane's case
he is coming to oversee the execution
i will turn over the information i have on the Trust as soon as he arrives
that should exonerate Sloane
Thank you
Sydney
what exactly did you find in the Senator's effects
nothing
i requested them but they haven't arrived
now i do not have to look
Looks like the west stairwell is your most direct access to the sub levels
what about countermeasures
the best we can tell it is only the guards but we haven't had a chance to do a thorough scan
Sort of working on the fly
Listen about what happened in Richmond
you were doing your job
and she is your wife
not for long
Jack i want you to meet Marlin Bell
he runs legal policy at Justice
Good to meet you
i was telling the Director how pleased i am you caught Sloane
since my signature was on the pardon agreement
i was embarrassed and relieved and if you do not mind my saying so
looking forward to seeing the son of a bitch die
Excuse us
you are not gonna help me
in April 75 in Saigon you toasted Sydney's birth with a bottle of Chambertin Clos de Bze
Your favorite
now that i know you have a daughter
i thought i should return the honor especially considering they share the same mother
Irina betrayed both of us Jack
she sought me out for information the same way she did you
she was my wife
she was a KGB spy who cared nothing about you or me
i have always thought that you understood your relationship with Irina was nothing more than that
but now that your schoolboy crush on the woman who destroyed your life is preventing you from saving mine
i will have to revise that assessment
Irina Derevko affected your life every bit as much as she affected mine
i knew the possibility existed that Sydney would be drawn into our world but i often wondered why you were the one who sought her out why you showed such paternal affection toward her
now i know
you did it because you were angry and jealous and wanted to take away the one thing that was important to both Irina and me
the symbol of what we had and you did not
Sydney
you are right
i am not gonna help you
since this is the last conversation we will ever have
i want to make this perfectly clear
what you have done to my daughter is nothing compared to what i will do when i find yours
Salut
half an hour
i am on the list
Everyone's on the list
my friends are waiting for me inside
Wait your turn until then stop talking
Back in line
Lay off the suit man
Why do not you find your way home
oh is that right
you are a big tough guy now living a dream
you want to see what i am dreaming
all right
Take it easy you win
i pray for you
i pray your soul can find peace in the next life
that is very kind Marcus
Let's go
i am heading down
Copy that Mountaineer
you are all clear
Marshall work your magic
no problemo
i should have it open for you in
Right now
Lauren this is restricted access
i cleared it with Justice
i had no intention of missing the execution of this traitor
Marshall we have a problem
Copy that Mountaineer
what is the problem
Motion sensor
it is on a random sweep
that was not on the schematics
must be a secondary protocol
i have located the hourglass
can you disarm the sensor remotely
i am trying
there are a lot of dummy codes
i have to extrapolate each one
i have never seen a system like this
is there a repeating prefix in the majority of the codes
8686
it is an anchor type design
Grab Dixon
he spec'd out a similar system for a mission in Honduras
he will know what the back door is
Dixon
i can not
he is downstairs
he is witnessing Mr Sloane's execution
the execution is going forward
yeah at midnight
i thought you know
for some reason it makes me incredibly sad
i feel like you are the only person i can talk to about this
Marshall kill the grid now
Right sorry
Talk later
do you have any final words
i do
for you who pay witness
i can only believe there is a common thought amongst you all
this is as it should be
i do not disagree
my only request that if my daughter is in fact found alive that she understand my actions she understand that this day's events are the net result of her father's passion to find her to know her to love her
we can not wait any longer
i am going in
Stand down Mountaineer
i am almost there
Raidon's security detail is 2 dozen strong
Sydney
do not
there is nothing you can say
Sloane is dead
we can now locate the Passenger without his interference
not quite
the code key you retrieved from the ClA is unusable
i can only assume that was deliberate on their part
Vaughn played you
he is likely to try again but that will be his last mistake
i am surprised you did not get the reference
Modified k exalate cocktail washed with tetrodotoxin presented in a bottle of Chambertin Clos de Bze
Just like we used in Saigon
but understand this was not done out of compassion
i orchestrated this because and only because
i need youthey are powerful and intelligent predators yet killer whales are above all families
Families that hunt and play and travel together
Take a look into the hidden lives of creatures that rule like lords over one of the richest ocean wilds on earth
the journey is an attempt to peer with a camera into a hidden kingdom of killer whales in the Pacific North West a long time goal of diver and film maker Theodore Pitcairn
his destination is an area inhabited by about 300 killer whales in the straits between the British Columbia mainland and Vancouver Island
Travelling to film the unseen the events of ocean life is a kind of continuing pilgrimage for Pitcairn
i have come to appreciate that every place in the ocean has its own enchanting qualities
here we enter a world of cold beauty of ice mist and fog
we have come here not only to film killer whales but the ocean wilds in which they live
i am curious to learn what makes this ocean habitat so special that hundreds of orcas congregate here
to humans the ocean here is unbearably cold
i must protect myself from its sting by wearing a drysuit that seals out the frigid water
sometimes i can see only a few feet away through the murk of plankton and other particles
Powerful currents often buffet me about
These cold water winds blow constantly through the kelp forests of the bottom so that the realm of the killer whale seems like a place invented by animators who can make plants seem like a troupe of dancers
Amid the swirling cold currents life abounds
Everywhere i point the camera there is something looking back at me
any shadowy corner can hold a surprise
Curiosity is not limited to our species
Sensing nothing either familiar or edible the octopus puts up his guard
which for the most intelligent of all molluscs means transforming its smooth body into a facade of menace
i know from experience it is not likely to attack something as large as me it is just trying to look as fierce as possible
when i do not appear terrified it is time to leave
for good measure he appears to booby trap my path with a sunflower star perhaps thinking that this predator feared by other bottom creatures will also intimidate me
to avoid frightening the octopus
Pitcairn moves off in a different direction only to come upon another strange creature
it looks like a snake with the head of an old man
Its name the wolf eel suggests ferociousness and its powerful jaws can crush spiny urchins
but like the octopus it is not inclined to attack a human
the wolf eel pair pay Pitcairn little notice preoccupied with courtship and their version of nuzzling
the dive is interrupted suddenly by a reminder that Pitcairn is in the home waters of killer whales
which are often heard before they are seen
through the murk of this sea they have detected my presence and at first seem curious but one look and they are satisfied
they return to the middle of the strait and go on about their business
Maybe they just prefer their own company
they are almost always seen in groups and rarely linger nearly a diver like me which makes it difficult to observe their daily lives
Maybe this group is moving from one good fishing area to the next
they are so skilful in hunting fish that they seem to have ample time simply to relax and to do very little at all
other creatures in the killer whale realm below must survive by eating organic matter blowing by in the endless currents
Like this nudibranch a kind of snail without a shell
each invents its own way of capturing morsels of food
Sweeping the water with its umbrella like bonnet the hooded nudibranch acts like a fisherman casting a net to catch passing plankton
the sea pen simply stands in the current allowing bits of food to lodge in its plume like body
the basket star an animal that
looks like a small bush in winter snags passing food with it branches
Barnacles scoop through the water with their feathery back legs and eat whatever they catch
sometimes the underwater breezes deliver a windfall
the jellyfish can rise and descend by pulsing
but its direction through the sea is determined mostly by the currents
Pretty as a flower the tentacles of the anemone are not only sticky but armed with powerful stinging cells
it is a sitting predator awaiting whatever the currents might send in its direction
the jellyfish may have travelled hundreds of miles to get here but once in the grasp of the an anemone its journey is over
Killer whales are not the only formidable creatures here but through size and intelligence they dominate this undersea world as strikingly as humans do the land
to better understand them
Pitcairn seeks out someone who knows them intimately
Biologist John Ford spends his entire professional life watching and pondering the culture of killer whales or orcas
he has done so since the early 70s
like an anthropologist studying an ocean tribe
few know them as well or have made so many discoveries about their way of life
Day after day he observes records photographs
Accumulating over decades a catalogue that identifies not only individual whales but entire family trees
the calls of the whales are often loud enough to be heard from the boat and Ford has learned to pay special attention to these sounds
Studying underwater recordings
Ford was among the first to recognise that killer whales communicate in dialects distinctive to each family group or pod
an individual's family heritage can be determined from the unique calls it makes
to catalogue the identity of every individual whale he encounters
Ford records distinguishing characteristics and assigns both names and numbers
37 and 46 they are two brothers just swimming together just relaxing with a bellyful of chum salmon and enjoying themselves and enjoying this boat
how close they want to get
for all the years of observation researchers like Ford are still baffled by a great deal of killer whale behaviour
the whale that was flipper slapping and tail slapping and following us along there was A64 schooner just a juvenile
not really sure what whales are doing when they make those kind of behaviours because it depends on the context and there is always kind of a curious thing to me when all the rest of the whales in the area are just going about their business and one individual like that one seems agitated or worked up about something and displays these kind of things over and over again for sometimes hours at a time
because monitoring from a boat is limited by weather
Ford has installed a permanent sound monitoring system
Linked to a transmitter it broadcasts continuously to his office the world's first all killer whale radio station
the live signal from the Robson Bight area coming down to the Vancouver aquarium here by a high quality digital line so we are listening as if we were in our
little boat with a hydrophone at Robson Bight but instead we are down here 200 miles to the south listening live
this is actually a catalogue of the calls that the whales make so we can match up the patterns this way
so when it goes that that is a N4 call
Young animals that are born into the pod learn those unique family dialects
their vocal dialects represent a kind of a family acoustic badge that identify the pod and help to keep the integrity and the identity of the pod together
my goal is to film them underwater in their own fluid realm
to try to convey how the world looks and feels to them
while they do not seem to like swimming close to divers they often like to be near boats so we experiment with a camera suspended on a pole hoping to get some close up views of these wary creatures
we get a few tantalising glimpses through the murk but not everything we hoped for
we will have to find a location where they are more at ease and devise a way to place our camera in their world without attracting their attention and suspicion
as the camera team deliberates over how best to film killer whales an immense change is underway in the kingdom the whales rule beneath the surface
Spring arrives in this world of shadows and ghostly white anemones marked by the appearance of strange matter adrift in the currents
it is the stuff of life and it is everywhere
a female sea cucumber prepares to launch a bundle of eggs
Nearby a male has begun to eject sperm
Conception among most bottom dwellers occurs not through intimacy with a mate but by blindly discharging the elements of new life into the passing currents
the drifting eggs or sperm of each individual will mix with other reproductive cells in a moment of fertilisation
the ocean itself is the womb
Throughout the coastal seas creatures of the ocean floor cast the seeds of their next generation into the liquid breezes
Turning the ocean into a soup of reproductive matter
but a great percentage of the spawn sent off by creatures like the slime sea star is likely to be intercepted
for hungry finish and filter feeders the seeds of new life are just another kind of food to pluck from the currents
the killer whales are mostly just observers their world explodes each March with a rush of predators
Dolphins harbour seal seabirds and sea lions all attracted to a massive spawning event that overshadows those of the bottom dwellers
Tens of millions of herring stream from the open
Pacific toward the British Columbia shoreline to spawn
to get there they must make it through a gauntlet of carnivores
Panicked by the appearance of predators each fish seeks safety in the middle of the school producing what looks like a giant silver organism trying desperately to find a safe path to its spawning grounds
i encounter so many things in the sea that could not occur on land
in the dense embrace of water a thousand weightless creatures whirl and dart side by side like an artwork come to life
i drift beneath it mesmerised
the local people call it simply a fish ball belying the elegant symmetry and beauty of what i see down here
the relentless attacks by birds sea mammals and larger fish continue but the herring are unable to turn seaward and flee
Programmed by their genes to spawn they have no alternative but to push onward to the shallows
the assault from above escalates
in these shallow waters there is no place to hide
Gulls wait at the surface murres and cormorants dive deep enough to strike from the sides and below
for a time the annual herring frenzy so dominates life along the coast that it attracts even migratory grey whales into the realm of the killer whales
Among the patches of seafoam fringing the shore another kind of white phenomenon appears signalling that throngs of male herrings have begun to disperse their sperm into the sea
in places the shallows turn milk white
the release of these clouds of sperm or milt triggers a reproductive frenzy
the females try to press their eggs into the milt deposited by the males on the bottom
all the while the milt drifts upward in such volume that vision becomes difficult
a single female can produce 25 000 eggs the result is an undersea blizzard of almost incomprehensible proportions
Sticky white herring eggs encrust virtually every surface of the shallows from eel grass and rocks to crab shells
Nearly all of the eggs will be
lost to predators and the whims of the sea
but if only one in every 5000 produces an adult the herring population will be sustained
for gulls the appearance of herring means a season of plenty
each receding tide uncovers a feast of eggs
there is such a profusion of nourishment that the grey whales come all the way into the shallows to partake
Raking the eel grass with its baleen plates one of the largest creatures in the sea feeds on eggs the size of bird seed
though most of the herring return to deeper waters some die of wounds or stress
the sunflower star takes care of those left behind
Oddities appear under water during the herring spawning
a hemlock tree seems to grow from the bottom of the sea
Observing the annual herring feast over centuries native peoples sought ways of exploiting it for human food
they discovered that spawning herring were attracted to hemlock for some reason
Along the west coast of Vancouver Island the Hesquiat tribe still harvests eggs deposited on the hemlock branches they set up early each Spring in advance of the spawning
Like their ancestors present day Hesquiats treasure the herring caviar as a delicacy
their harvest is purely for tribal consumption
but a taste for herring eggs is not limited to native people here
in another cove spawning herring pass among kelp fronds strung artificially on lines
the Ahousaht and Toquat peoples of Vancouver Island have modified their traditional herring harvests to take advantage of the great demand for herring eggs elsewhere
in Japan herring roe is a delicacy that commands high prices
the tribes and some non native fishermen as well catch schools of herring using fishing nets then transfer them into netted enclosures where they spawn on the kelp fronds
the captive herring school attracts nonhuman harvesters as well
River otters descend from nearby streams to fill their bellies with herring
Working under commercial licences each year the two native tribes can each collect as much as 40 tonnes of eggs on kelp
what is merely food for otters is big business for humans
such commercial harvests can be worth millions of dollars
Egg laden kelp fronds are salted packed and shipped by air to Japan today
though the industry arose in the 1970s such trading actually began a century ago when Japanese entrepreneurs obtained herring eggs from tribes father north along the coast and sailed with them all away across the Pacific
Yet the commercialism is mixed with an ancient respect for the cycles of nature
when the harvest ends the nets walling the inclusion are opened permitting the herring to escape in the hope they will return and spawn again next spring
though killer whales nibble at the spawning schools herring make up less than 5 of their diet
they are awaiting a spawning event still to come that will bring their favourite prey into these waters
Yet as the killer whales mark time the greatest exploitation of the herring is about to begin
it dwarfs the hunting by ocean animals and the harvesting by natives and Vancouver Island Harbour s commercial fishing boats await the start of a different kind of herring frenzy
the opening of the herring season is the beginning of an ocean goldrush
to prevent overfishing authorities stringently limit the commercial herring season often to only a single daily each year
sometimes to only one hour
one hour in which many fishermen must haul in most of their fishing income for the entire year
so valuable is the fishery that luck can bring boat owners a near fortune in a day and failure can mean bankruptcy
it is a high stakes drama in which not a second can be lost
after racing to find a school using sonar they must quickly encircle it with the same net then draw the net tight often catching more than herring
Making money on herring requires spending it
a seiner and its complement of equipment can cost a million and a half dollars
but depending on luck and skill in their brief window of opportunity they may pull in anywhere from 20 to 200 tonnes of herring
the only market is Japan and prices fluctuate with the Japanese economy
there have been years when the catch of a single boat brought in a quarter of million dollars
an unintended catch of large mammals can mean damaged nets and panicked animals
the fishermen give the sea lions every opportunity to escape
and one by one they all do
Herring return to the same waters each years to spawn
if too many are caught those waters will be barren in future years
Already some areas no
longer support a fishery and there are debates over whether the herring population is being jeopardised by too much fishing
so intense is the rush to haul in fish captains can imperil both their boats and crews by overloading
Even large vessels can be overturned by 200 tonnes of fish in their net
the catch of herring for their eggs is one of the main drivers of British Colombia's fishing economy
but unlike the harvest by marine animals and native tribes no herring survive to return to the sea
the eggs will be taken from dead females for sale to Japan
the tonnes of remaining herring carcasses will be sold not as human food but for the most part as fertiliser
as Spring turns to summer the flood of life awaited by the killer whales approaches from the open sea
Salmon by the millions in wave after wave
the killer whales residing along this coast prefer salmon above all other foods
to catch them pod members spread out and comb the area
they send out sonar like high frequency clicks that echo off objects in the sea giving them an acoustic means of detecting their prey through murky waters
through summer and into Fall those salmon that survive seek out their natal streams and begin a difficult journey against currents and rapids
Having survived killer whales they now meet a terrestrial equivalent
but survival is not their purpose
after spawning all the salmon will die
Adult grizzlies and their cubs shun the dead fish in search of those still alive
in the meantime they snack on the salmon eggs that are in the bottom
when more salmon arrived the bears feast relentlessly
Grizzlies face a deadline as fall approaches
to survive the long sleep of winter they must pack on as much fat as possible
some gain 300 pounds or more most of the weight coming from long days of eating salmon
it can be both filling and exhausting
for John Ford salmon season provides an opportunity to learn more about killer whale feeding techniques and preferences
an experienced eye sees a capture in a quick lunge
Time has shown that the killer whales hunt all six of the salmon species found here
it looked to me like a chum about the right size
and it was quite a prolonged chase there huh
we saw them take a chum salmon very likely there is a big run of chum salmon coming through this strait today and we managed to get a scale sample from that kill
and we will be able to identify what species it is from the unique quality of the scale
as if from nowhere a pack of white sided dolphins appears interrupting the killer whale hunt
the dolphins rocket about bothering the whales
like a gang of rowdy youngsters
it is an odd mingling of two marine mammals
but Ford sees it often
those dolphins like to pester the whales
we see them doing it to humpback whales as well
where they will chase them around and smack them with their tails and just generally be kind of pesky for whatever reason
Suddenly and inexplicably the dolphin pack disappears
other sea mammals in the vicinity seem to be on alert as if some kind of menace approaches
the menace is real a pack of aggressive killer whales passes through driving harbour seals ashore
more nomadic than the resident whales of the region and travelling in smaller families these transients also prefer the meat of sea lions and dolphins to fish
Distinguished by tall pointed dorsal fins these mammal eaters do not seem to mingle with their fish eating cousins
Evidence of the often violent ways of transients can be graphic
Biologist Cathy Heisey examines the body of a dead dolphin found at sea by a boater
Like the pack that interrupted the hunt it is a white sided dolphin
i can tell you for certain that it was killed by a killer whale just judging by the teeth rake marks on its body
and whether it was killed by transient killer whales or resident killer whales i can not tell you but my guess is that it is transients because they are the only ones that we have seen fatally attacking animals and what is surprising to me is that they did not eat it because they obviously injured it and perhaps played with it even for a while after they killed it just judging by the different types of rake marks that are on its body they are all different angles and are all quite deep
Until the early 1970s the realm of killer whales in British Colombia lay mostly beyond the interests of humanity
but the curiosity of scientists and film makers has since fuelled a popular fascination with these intelligent creatures
People come from around the world hoping to catch a glimpse of wild orcas
Identification catalogues enable them to learn the name and family history of the creatures they watch
some learn for the first time that the swimmers before them are travelling families whose social relationships are among the most complex of any mammals on earth
a family like this is led by a mother and all of her young will remain with her as long as she lives
Approaching the boat is not just a juvenile whale it is someone's daughter sister granddaughter
but no matter how close observers get they see only that tiny fraction of the killer whale s existence that takes place in our world of air
Pitcairn and his friends have devised a plan to peer at least briefly into the hidden part of killer whale existence by going where other visitors cannot
in these undisturbed waters we come upon a family bound somewhere through the morning mist and cold
for a moment they do not seem
like mighty predators just a family on a lonely journey
Pitcairn s destination appears unremarkable
a beach covered by a bed of smooth pebbles that extends out into the shallows
but in fact it is a special place where killer whales may let down their guard
in hopes of capturing a few moments of killer whale behaviour here the team arrives with an arsenal of equipment
Pitcairn and his team have secured special permission to film in this ecological reserve a whale sanctuary off limits to whale watchers
to avoid disturbing the whales no diver will enter the water only a remotely controlled camera
the underwater cameraman must learn to practise his craft sitting on dry land before a miniature steering wheel
the team will set up camp then wait to see if any whales show up
as they prepare killer whales sounds arise just offshore an auspicious sign
they toss a hydrophone into the water
Pitcairn's worry is that the effort will turn out to be a waste of time
this is his second attempt
the previous year the team waited three weeks and no whales ever showed up
every precaution has been taken to avoid disrupting killer whale behaviour but there is no way to know if the wary animals will shy away even from an untended camera
the wait begins
on only the second day they sight a killer whale family rounding the point headed toward them
the underwater microphones pick up the raspy sound of a whale scraping against the bottom
the area is called a rubbing beach because killer whales frequently seek it out to rub their bodies against the bed of pebbles
no one is sure why
their markings show them to be a family well known to scientists in the area
a 52 year old matriarch named Stripe her three children and a grandson
the tallest fin belongs to her 28 year old son Okey solo the most enthusiastic among them when it comes to rubbing
her 18 year old daughter Ripple has a two year old son of her own
Midsummer who seems reluctant to rub but follows his mother when she makes a pass across the bottom
Children at play adults enjoying a relaxing swim it seems the undersea equivalent of a family day at the beach
though Stripe also rubs occasionally the matriarch stays close to be her grandson and youngest son seven year old Fife
Stripe knows how quickly tragedy can strike
over the years she has lost three of her young
one captured for a marine park one struck by a ferry one to unknown causes
little Midsummer continues to frolic of the beach but he won't dare descend to rub the bottom
his uncle on the other hand can not get enough
an adult male like Okey solo may have fathered young of his own but they remain with their mothers in other family groups
Okey solo will not leave his own mother all of her life
some males simply disappear when their mother dies
no killer whales in the world other than the 200 living around northern
Vancouver Island are known to rub like this
we are as puzzled as other observers why do they rub
some believe it is a way of scraping away parasites
but if so would not killer whales elsewhere do the same thing
Perhaps we try too hard to find practical explanations for behaviour in the wild
Maybe the killer whale families here have simply found a way to have fun something that just feels good
and across generations they have passed on this little tradition of pleasure and the whereabouts of these pebble beaches
it is their secret
and we are peeking into the place in their world where they can escape the labours of daily survival for an occasional hour of amusement
as the others watch from offshore
Okey solo returns for one last rub
Perhaps inspired by his uncle
little Midsummer finally descends for his first pass over the pebbles rubbing and blowing bubbles at the same time
Watching their last pass across the stones
i am reminded yet again hat we can not really comprehend the minds of creatures who dwell in a liquid world so different from our own
and yet we share with them the concerns of parenthood and the devotion to family and maybe also a need for sheer fun
at least that is what i would like to believe
it is one thing to observe anonymous animals in the wild quite another to know them by name to know their ways of relaxing to know even their family tragedies
as they leave they no longer seem to us strangers in an alien realm but a family heading home from the diversions of a summer afternoonmy name is Michael Westen
i used to be a spy until

no
our work will continue
how will it continue without a leader
i see two leaders standing right before me

do what you think is right
when you work undercover the lines between loyalty and betrayal can become so blurred so grey that after a while you do not know what you are fighting for anymore
Michael think of all the good things we could do together

this is James Kendrick to all operatives
Forgive me
i have made an error

Let's get the hell out of here
Go

you are lying to protect the guy you are supposed to be taking down
if you shut this down you lose all hope of stopping him
you are not just helping'em you are one of'em
so i am asking you to trust me
Gunshot
all right
i dumped the Humvee in a lot down the road
Hopefully it won't be found until nightfall if we are lucky
i tossed the phones in a garbage truck heading north
if anybody tracks'em they will be digging through landfill
we have some breathing room for now
yeah Mike um we gotta figure out our next steps here
you guys should just go
my mom and Charlie should be at the rally point
you need to get them out of Miami
Well what about you
i will uh i will figure something out
Just go
Mike
we are not leaving you here man
you crazy
we got problems Problems i caused
Michael you lost your way
i betrayed the mission Fi and i turned on all of you
Mike just stop right there
we did not risk our necks saving you just to leave you behind
the ClA is gonna want to know what the hell went down back there and we need your help to sort it out
now you with us
Mike are you in
all right good
we should get going
it is a long ass walk into town
in the field there is nothing harder than when you let your team down
Apologies and regrets do no good
you all just have to move on and make the best of the situation
Hey you guys have prepaid cell phones
by the window
Thank you
it is crucial to stay focused to try to keep your mind off the past
Michael anyone coming
but there are times when that is just not possible
Michael
i hesitated
Back there on the roof
after all we have been through together
i almost did not pull that trigger
but you did
Why did you come back Fi
i did not deserve it
i did not do it because you deserved it
there is no way you could have known you'd make it out alive
i knew that if i was wrong about you
it did not matter if i got out of there alive
Upbeat music

okay i am good
what the hell's all this
Supplies
Figured we could use some duct tape you know
one for everyone
Just in case
and you are getting beer
you realize we are on the run right
yes which means this could be our last six pack
okay
Well in that case get something imported
' cause i am not drinking that crap
Gun clicks
Hands where i can see'em
what seems to be the problem here
Well you tell me
you are the guys that the cops are looking for
News says there is a 50 000 reward
Well looks like we just hit the lottery
Ain't that right Marcos
Gun clicks
Electricity crackles engine starts 50 000 each right
Hey fellas can we talk
Sure we can work something out
i mean do we look armed and dangerous to you
Hey shut up
and the news did not say nothing that you gotta be alive
yeah i got this here bald headed one yeah and the one with the chin
what is taking Jesse and Sam so long
we got to get out of here
Look there the back of the store
oh God Michael we have to get in there
all i have in my purse is some C 4
our guns are empty
we are gonna have to bluff it
as an operative it is your job to determine how likely a particular plan is to succeed and if something looks
like a suicide mission to call it off
yeah that is the plan
Let's go in and bluff
yeah
of course that only matters if you care if you live or die
Michael what are you doing
Michael
Michael open the door
Michael
Tires screeching
Ooh
Gunshots
Grunts
Stay down
Jesus Mike
you all right
Grunts
yeah
it just grazed me
Michael
what the hell
you could have been killed
i was not
Let's go
Phone rings
yeah
it is me
i was wondering if you were gonna call
Sirens wail
Strong my friends and i are all over the news
yeah there is good reason for that
because you are the most wanted people in the state right now if not the country
Well you have to call this off
do not you dare tell me what i have to do
the last i heard from you we were supposed to be capturing Kendrick
Only when i got there do you know what i found
no target no Agent
Just Sonya lying dead on the helipad
i assume that was your work
yeah that was me
i do not know what the hell happened out there but i know this
you and your friends have destroyed this entire operation
Look my friends had nothing to do with that
Leave them out of this
i will come in i will save your breath
' cause the ClA is fresh out of deals for Michael Westen
you promised them Kendrick's network and they did not get it
this operation's over
my career is over
and as for you
if you think it was tough being burned you haven't seen anything yet
a spy's ability to operate depends on secrecy
Your anonymity is your greatest weapon
it allows you to operate anywhere to deceive your enemies and when it is all over to slip back into the shadows
we have obtained information that federal authorities believe that the suspects may have been involved in terrorist activities
when the world knows your face your options get a lot more limited
at that point all you can really do is attack
we go after Kendrick directly
Mike come on
you can not be serious
you want to go after him now
the ClA they are sending everything they have after us but they want James
they want his network
i think it is the only card we have left to play
Come on after everything that just went down that is suicide
i have to try whatever the consequence
Sonya mentioned a satellite expert in Miami
he was making a communication center for James
if i can locate him i might have a chance to pull this off
you guys lay low uhuh brother
if you think we are all gonna just hide in a hole somewhere while you do this it is not gonna happen
it is my decision
Mike enough
we are in this
you are in no position to do this by yourself
and there is a communications guy i used to work with
i trust him
i will talk to him
Maybe he can help us find James' guy
we will work on this
you need to go see your mom
Knock at door
Michael
i was afraid
Mom it is all right
it is all right
what does that mean
Fi got to me
she got to me before it was too late
Sighs
where is everybody
i thought we are supposed to meet here at the rally point if things went wrong
Plans have changed
this phone is gonna be for emergencies
you need to stay out of sight for just a little while longer
Michael what is going on
Answer me
what is going on
the ClA found out what i was doing
they are hunting for us
so what are you gonna do
i am going after James and his network
it is our only chance
Michael please
i have seen what those people can do
i do not want you going
Please
i have made up my mind
i do not want to lose another son
Mom i can not make any promises
sometimes sacrifices have to be made
Charlie's birthday is coming up soon
and when i asked him who he wanted there the first person he said was Uncle Michael
i do not think you understand
we are having strawberry ice cream
do you remember who else loved strawberry ice cream
Nate
if you can not make it to the party what am i supposed to tell Charlie when he asks where you are
i have to go
Door opens closes
Car door opens
Ooh
How'd you do
my buddy came through
Snuck me into the research office
we checked out all the top satellite experts in Miami
i think we hit the jackpot
that is Max Lyster
Contracts for the NSA mostly
but get this
a few months ago he took a leave from his firm to work on a special project
Nobody knows what it was
James' communication center
Time frame fits perfectly
he is our guy
that is the good news
the bad news is he is a security nut
Lives in a gated community in the Gables consults at a naval base in the Everglades
what about hitting him in transit
my thoughts exactly
Sam and Fi are on it
they are getting supplies
Jesse i need to ask you something
when we do this tomorrow i need you to watch over my mom and Charlie
Mike you guys are gonna have your hands full taking down James
i need to be there
i can not do this without knowing that they are safe
Please
all right man
i guess that is how we do it
Engine turns
Grabbing someone on the move is all about surprise
the goal is to get your target out of his car and into yours before he knows what is happening
if you have the manpower it is best to separate into two teams
one to track the target's car
Phone rings
and one to prepare the ambush
yeah what is going on
Lyster's headed your way
okay i am putting everything in place right now
okay all set
what is your E T a
20 seconds
Take cover
Copy that
okay here we go
Impact in three two
Son of a bitch
Rock music

Tires screeching
you gotta be kidding me
yeah guys we got a problem
the tires did not blow
the car is armored
Catch him Fi
Reality check
it is not gonna happen
we have to Sam
he knows we are after him
if he alerts James it is over
okay how
the car just took a couple shots of buckshot at 10 feet without a dent
what the hell are you gonna do
Fi you still have that C 4 in your bag
yes but what are you gonna Stay with him
Michael are you gonna do not lose him
Pull up alongside him
Get closer
Closer Fi
Tires screeching
Michael are you sure
Stay with him
Michael
Tires screeching
Small explosive charges won't penetrate an armored car but that doesn't mean they are useless
if you are desperate enough a well placed charge can come in handy
Explosion
an armored car won't drive if its wheels are not on the ground
Grunts
who are you
who we are is not important
what do you want
you set up a secret communication center for James Kendrick
where is it
i do not know what you are talking about
Max
Gunshot
it is not a good idea to lie to people with this much gas around
Gunshot
what are you doing
you are gonna kill both of us
Gunshot
yes i am unless you answer my question
Gunshot
Michael
where is it
okay
Stop
Just stop
okay listen some guys came to me
they gave me a bunch of money
so i did a job for'em and they came back and they said if i ever said anything i was dead
it is in a building downtown all right
Good
you are gonna take us to it
James has a communication center in there
i do not buy it
i swear
it is the old Miami Chronicle building
they condemned it after the last hurricane
These guys could get any building they want
Why would they use some moldy old place
the building had all the tech already satellite hookups microwave dish array all of it
they bought it from the demolition team
i just hooked into what was there
it makes sense Sam
near a main road no one would notice anyone going in or out
Perfectly hidden in plain sight
Unbelievable
how many people are in there
how many guards
it is unmanned
it is just a relay station
they pick up secure signals they decrypt them they pass'em on
are there backups to the system
Please he will kill me
if we succeed he is in no position to kill anyone
if we do not well you are dead anyway
Hard drive
Records everything in case the power goes out
that is what we will bring to the ClA
you are gonna tell us where to find it and how to get it
and then can i go
then you can go back into the trunk until it is over
Chuckles
he is serious
Shut up
when breaking into a building it is generally best not to use the door
any entrance your enemy knows you'd use is too risky
which means the safest way in is often the hardest
before we do this we need to talk
she is right Mikey
it is important
what you did earlier plowing into that store and then jumping on the car almost incinerating yourself
it was a calculated risk
i needed information and Mike do not
we have known each other too long
there is a difference between a necessary risk and a death wish and you know it
Sighs
Michael i know you are hurting
i know you regret what you have done
but what is killing yourself gonna prove
we are wasting time
Let's do this
Device beeps
Explosion
now we know why James did not need guards
yeah he takes his booby traps seriously
Well it is a hell of a place for a comm center
Sighs
Moment of truth
Keypad beeps
Door clicks open
after you
okay
that should be everything you and Charlie need
Rattling
it is a little overstuffed but it just has to last till we settle down someplace
when will that be
Honestly i do not know
Soon hopefully
Maybe uh never
i do not like to think that way
but it is best to be prepared right
it is gonna be okay
it is
we are together
we are gonna take care of each other
we just need to get out of state find a place to lay low set up some new i D s
we will be good
Jesse how can you do this
with everything that is happened you are still here for Michael
what makes you think i am just here for Michael
you are talking about going into hiding for years maybe with a bunch of people who have not made your life very easy
Haven't you ever wanted to just Go
i have asked myself that same question many many times
i just i do not know
when i was a kid it was just me and my mom
and then she got killed and then it was just me
Just me
Until i met you guys
i never had a family and now i got one
Sniffles
you do have a family Jesse
Sorry
Laughter
all right
Grunts
Got'em
Let's go
Phones ringing
uh it is me
uh no Fi
it is not just you
it is all our phones
this is bad
Phones continue ringing
Anybody have our numbers besides Maddy
no
Phone beeps
hello
you broke my heart Michael
Gave you everything and you broke my heart
it is over James
we have your entire network
it is over
no Michael
i do not think it is over
Remember the convenience store you robbed yesterday
you stole some mobile phones there
Well i tracked them down and they led me to my very own relay station
Knock knock we are right outside the control room Michael
oh and one more thing
you will never guess where those other two phones led me
all right Maddy this is it
you all set
yeah
got this got this
Let's do it
Grunts
oh my goodness
Tires screeching
what is it Jesse
James this is between you and me
not anymore Michael
i like your mama
and your nephew Charlie's a lovely boy
and even though it pains me i will not hesitate to shoot them down like dogs just like you killed my Sonya
Leave my family out of this
the boy is only three years old
Michael if you want to save them you will surrender you will tell me what you have done and then you will die
and my friends
i could use some bargaining chips with the ClA
do as i tell you and they will live
i just need just a little more time
i know you
you are looking for the answer the way out
there is no way out
there is only the reckoning now
you are out of time Michael Westen
would you allow me to call my mother
then i will come out quietly
two minutes no more
Phone beeps
Michael you
okay look no
Phone dialing
hello
Mom listen to me

there is no need to explain
he is using us
yes Mom and any move i make is gonna get the three of you killed
so i am gonna have to give him what he wants
no
do not you give that man a damn thing
Ma you do not understand
you and Charlie
i do understand Michael
and Charlie's gonna be fine
what are you talking about
i found a way to buy Jesse and Charlie a chance to get out of here
Ma i do not know what you are planning but
Michael
you said it yourself
sometimes
Sacrifices must be made
in the bag of supplies there was an explosive charge
Mom do not
Please do not do listen to me
there is no remote detonator Michael and there is no time to build one
Michael you have protected me enough and now you need my help
if saving you means i do not get out of here it is fine with me
God knows i have failed you enough times in the past
Give me this please
Michael listen to me
you made mistakes
we all did
but i am so proud of the man you are
i always have been
i love you Michael
i love you
Goodbye baby
Goodbye Mom
it is time
Maddy
there has to be another way
there is no other way
those men outside are about to break in here and somebody's gotta be here to Use this thing
no
this is crazy
i am not letting you do this
Jesse this has nothing to do with you and me
it has everything to do with that boy
this is just a distraction and it will take a lot of them out but you gotta fight your way out of here
i can not do that
you can
it is as simple as that
Charlie honey
Come here baby
that is my boy
Come here
Come here sweetheart
Hmm
Look at me
do you know grandma loves you
and she would do anything anything in the world to protect you
now i want you to go with Jesse
and you are gonna play a game okay
you are gonna hide and just shut your eyes really tight and you cover your ears
you do that for me
you give me a hug
Come here baby
you gotta go now
Go Jesse please
Bye Charlie
Mike you gotta call her back
this is crazy
Phone beeps

Please hang up and
Son of a bitch
Thud

Let's do this
Five seconds

James i am coming out
Guns click
Michael
i was beginning to wonder if we understood each other
we understand each other fine
Fiona's coming out
she is gonna talk terms for the others
Chuckles
there is nothing to negotiate but if she wants to talk we will talk
besides I'd like her to watch you die
that is far enough Michael

Softly

Rock music
Gunfire

Let's go
Gunfire
Gunfire
Gun clicks
Aah
i am out
i have half a clip
it is a valiant effort Michael
Noble
you are only delaying the inevitable
this is over
Gunshots
you know it
Gun clicks
James' men are devoted to him
if i make a run for him they will come out from cover to defend him
if you are fast you can take out the last two
and then what
you do not even have a gun
you will have to lend me yours
Well that is not possible
if this is about your death wish
i want to live
Maybe more than i ever have
when you put it that way
Gunfire
Grunts
Michael
Grunts
Panting
it is over James
so what now
you gonna turn me in
you gonna hand me over to the ClA
what are you looking for
Redemption
you want your old life back
it is gone
it was gone when you decided that she was more important than anything else
i know
Time to go
not gonna happen
you do not have a choice
there is always a choice Michael
those explosives you saw on the way in
they are not just for keeping people out
Michael that is a dead man switch
it did not have to be this way
we could have done amazing things together
we could have changed the world
Ah
another life
Rapid beeping
Somber music

Thanks for coming
Well we did not have a choice
Your guys walked us in from the detention area
i know this has been a hard time for a lot of reasons
i can not really get into all the details but i wanted you to know that we have tracked down over a hundred operatives worldwide who were working for James' network and they were in a position to do a lot of damage
Well i guess that is something to think about
during the long nights in our cells
about your detention there are a lot of people here who want to leave you there
they are just not in a forgiving mood
Scoffs
Well figures as much
you know spies
Bunch of bitchy little girls
Slurps drink
yeah sometimes
Fact is you are the heroes of this Op
so i played a little bureaucratic hardball and uh i got you cleared
you can go
what do you mean
i mean there is a car waiting for you downstairs
they will take you
oh hey um one more thing
the wall downstairs the memorial to the agents fallen in the line of duty
Michael's gonna get his star
Thank you
Drumroll
Gunshots
Bagpipe playing somber music
a spy is never truly done being a spy until he is dead
it is part of you
the skills the secrets
they never go away
and as long as you can be useful to someone it is your fate to always be a spy 
but if there is one thing spies are bad at it is accepting fate 
Well they missed a good funeral
where do you think they are
Hard to say
Lot of places in the world with C 4 and yogurt
we will hear from them when the time is right
yeah
got any plans
not really no
you
i am supposed to meet a guy later at the Carlito
Friend of Elsa's
yeah
what about
i do not know
some kind of problem
Sounded pretty desperate on the phone
Wanna come with
you buying the mojitos
Deal
Good luck Mike
Wherever you are
Gentle music

how is he doing
i think he is okay
he just fell asleep like this
should i um
oh no i think he is fine
what will i tell him when he is older
about what
about me
Tell him the truth
where would i start
Start from the beginning
Start with
my name is Michael Westen
i used to be a spy
sync corrected by elderman elder manSElYU and ACE PlCTURES Present
White level
OK
here
yep
you have got it upside down
Your skin looks bad
does it
are not you getting any
that is good
Right
that corner over there
you can not see it now over there
if you could walk from down there and cross kitty corner when the light changes
then come this way
i will be here
when you reach here look at me
do not look at the camera
you do not have to say anything
should he stop here
a little forward
OK
Right there
Mark it
shall we try one
what happens when he gets here
i was going to use it for the opening
you sure we need it
Let's just take it
we can throw it out later
Roger
if you would
Yoko
we will check size and focus
can you cross the street and stand over there
Right
that is good
how is it
Hang on
Say when
OK
Ready
Go ahead
Roll it then
Rolling
what is wrong
the signal
yeah just keep going
i am zooming in
Cut that was a bit stiff
Again
uh no
Try to relax
Just be natural
Just like you usually are
will my face be in this
no we will mosaic it out
we will sit like this
Facing the camera
Just for this shot
Just to establish that i am interviewing you
Maybe you should take us from over there
That'd be better
Focus on you
yeah past Kanemura to me
we will mosaic him won't we
yeah
Hang on
what happens to this tape after it is all finished and been on TV
this work tape
we erase it after the editing
all of it
yeah
we keep what we use and erase the rest
and mosaic the parts you keep
of course
that is what goes on the air
Why
but then if you just mosaic the parts that you show then people at the station will see the other parts
Suspicious are not we
i guess you would be this being TV
Trust me
it is not that i do not trust you
Trust me
i trust you
no one will know who you are
i promise
i sure hope not
do not worry
Make sure OK
shall we start
OK
Sorry
do not look at the camera
Look at me just like that
OK let's roll
Rolling
Sorry one more thing
sometimes on TV shows like this they say weird things about you or change what you said
do not worry
my voice is on this too so we can not do that
we do not have permission to shoot here
oh OK shall we start
Wait could you take out your radio
the radio
Like that is it in the shot
yeah
are you rolling
yes
OK
here we go
we will start with your work
what do you do for a living
nothing special
Part time jobs
Like what
Pumping gas security guard
is work hard to get these days
it is a recession
do you carry this radio at work too
yes
and no one finds out
i do not listen at work
Just going there and back on the train
what sort of things do you pick up on the train
the train radio you know like when there is an accident
they talk about it like where it was and all that
but is not it wrong to listen in like that
not just to listen i do not think
Maybe if i started telling other people
i see
what else
you mean on the train
on the train on the street
Mainly cordless phones car phones
could you show it to us
Come in close OK
so you carry this with you
Ner vous
a bit
do not be
Just be natural
Just ignore the camera
how is that
a bit closer
could you turn it on
is that OK
we will mask the voice later
can you get a telephone
Sure
is it that simple to operate
the frequencies are fixed
you put them in the memory and scan
that is a phone call
yeah some old lady
Talking about what
who knows
the usual
can you get anything else
Just a minute
that is a phone sex line
you could get into this
Thank you
could you close up on Kanemura's mouth
Right tight in
Yoko tripod
Just a second
i did not think it'd sound so clear
are these calls from around here
yeah
People in the condos around here
what about at night
Younger people lovers people like that
yes
and girls
they stay on the phone forever
Ready
Thanks
all right let's go on
how did you get started on this hobby
in middle school on'P' channel
' P' channel
what is that
Police radio
oh i see
a friend of mine had one
it made me feel like i was almost a policeman myself
I'd spend all day listening
what kind of a feeling was it
Did you get off on it
Well i did not exactly' get off' right at the start
but something like that
and then you were hooked
when did you really get into it
in high school
i saved up and bought a lot of equipment
it is expensive
yes if you are in high school
after i bought this I'd spend all day with it
when i was still new to it it was amazing
so what kind of things can you pick up
Well like i said before
can you give us more detail
Well cordless phones car phones portable phones
then there is CB radio the Fire Department and bugging devices
you hear some interesting things
then there is aircraft now and again
what do you gain out of hearing all these things
Well you do not really'gain' anything
you know something no one else does
i guess there is a kind of pleasure in that
and you do not think anyone's listening on the phone so people say all kinds of things
this old lady i think lives near me calls me a pervert
someone you know
some old bitch in the neighborhood
i think she is stopped using her cordless phone
Whoops
i am sorry
everything OK
so if she knows about you she is probably telling people is not she
Maybe
i just ignore her
do not you see her on the street
i see her but i pretend i do not
i do not want to talk to someone gossiping about me
i could not give a damn what she thinks
but looking at it another way are not you invading people's privacy
is not that wrong
i just listen
they are the ones on the frequencies
they can always stay off
Well you have got a point
this next question might sound a little strange
have you ever wanted to put what you hear to use
how
Well if you hear something confidential you might threaten to reveal it
oh I'd never do that
who knows what you might get mixed up in
uh oh sorry the battery's low
Yoko
Battery
Hang on
we have got to change the battery
Go ahead
here we go
uh you were saying
we are rolling are not we
you were talking about bugging devices before
there is a girl living near me in university i think
her room is bugged
it is
yeah
how did you find out
it just happened
how
Well when she comes home what she is doing matches what you can hear
so you can hear her opening her door turning on lights and playing her stereo
yeah
she lives opposite me
so what you can see and the sounds you hear fit together
that is right
is there a lot of that going on these days
yeah i think so
who put it there
not me
i did not do it
Probably a relative someone in her family
Why do you think that
someone probably found something out
it could just be a prank but
who do you think it was
Well she is a college girl probably her father
her father
yes
to keep an eye on her
she lives alone maybe he is worried
i bet you'd like to talk to her
who her
yes this girl
Well i mean her father if it is him has bugged his daughter's apartment to check up on her
would not you like to know what kind of a family it is
yeah but i do not think so
Why not
Think of the shock it would be if she found out
what kind of a shock would it be to find out you were getting your jollies from eavesdropping on her
but she doesn't know
it is as if it was not happening
Sorry look i am not criticizing you
i am sure it would be a great shock to her
but is not it better to know what is really going on
You'd put it on TV
that depends
i do not think so
it might be interesting for the people watching but what would it get the people being watched
but you'd like to know would not you
not just for entertainment
' Bugging family members' an interesting commentary on the modern family
Mr Iwai
the Police
Hide that
are we causing a problem
i am sorry

i am afraid so
there is no parking by the park entrance

H hey
Wait

We'd' ve just got mixed up in a lot of trouble
it is no big deal
Let's get a shot of the receiver
in here
yeah
Let's get the sound here in the van
Turn it on
Right
nothing
Guess not
something wrong
it hasn't been working well
i checked it out at home
Changed batteries too
can you fix it
i do not think so not here
i see
Let me ask you this
are there different kinds of these radio receivers
Sure
there is these and there is the desk top ones
Desk top
do you have other ones than that then
Sure
two of these and desk tops in my room and my car
one more like this
Did you bring it
no i just brought this one today
i see so you have got one at home
that is right
Let's go get it then
now
yeah
i want to hear how it sounds in a vehicle
where do you live
i will take the train home and get it
Why waste all that time
we will just drive there
but i do not want you filming my house
we won't film your house
do not worry
Let's go
you are sure
yeah
Let's go
Go right here
Roll 3
Ready
Thank you
OK pan from his window to the other building and zoom in on it
as if we are not sure
not sure which one it is
yeah
Hang on OK here we go
and then cut
that is right a little faster maybe
do it again faster
what the hell are you doing
do not film around here
oh sorry
it is a bad habit of ours
anything we see we film it
do not pay it any mind
Listen about that university girl
Just for an example would your receiver pick up something like a knock on her door
yeah it would
i see
where is it
Sorry the other one's not working at all
the new one too
there is nothing you can do
Sorry
so now what do we do
i mean we can not do a damn thing
now what
you have one inside do not you
a desk top one
yeah but
could we listen to the bug on that one then
no way
Why not
you said you would not shoot inside my room
yeah but now your receiver doesn't work
the girl's not involved with this
we will fix it so she doesn't know
Things are not the way we thought they'd be
i know we agreed to certain things but
could you help us out
if that is how it is i am gone
Just a few seconds
a few seconds
OK all right
for get it
but we are short of footage
there is not enough
Let's take the car
Yours
yeah
the receiver there will pick it up
I'd rather do it from there than in my room
Well we could do that
but the viewers would really like to see how you live
Man you are stubborn
Just for atmosphere
Hey relax
all right
we will use the car
where is it
that one
oh yeah
Come this way
Get the whole car
is this the antenna
Close in on it
Nice car you have got here
it is very small
do you get whole conversations
no they usually cut in and out
the frequencies change
Automatically
the areas are set
when you leave one area you get something else
you will go from one car phone to another one
so that means
if they are in a traffic jam you can hear it all
because they are stopped
can you go line in from the radio
is there an earphone jack
Just a minute
yes there is
then we can
Yoko where is the lead
in our van
what
we can not
have you done this work before
i am sorry
the expressway's probably jammed up too
it is one big parking lot
should we stay here
yeah just go straight ahead
hello
it is me
Good work
i am going to the airport
to Manila
yeah
i left the gun in a coin locker
the gun
i will pull over
i will tell you where the key is
Ready
Just a minute OK go ahead
Shinjuku Station West Exit by Halc the department store
Halc
oh OK
there is two phone booths by the coffee shop beside it
by the coffee shop
the right hand booth
it is wedged in beside the phone
no mistakes OK
Right
is the locker at the West Exit too
yeah
the West Exit
Go down the stairs under the'Shinjuku' sign and turn left
Downstairs and left
there is a horse race ad on it
a picture of a horse
a horse
yeah
in there
got it
i will come in when i get back
Say hello to the boss
OK
Take care
i will
See you
this doesn't sound too good
Did we get that
yes
Shinjuku West Exit
in front of Halc let's get going
we are going there
of course
Come on
Let's go
Really
do you get much of that
now and again
Like what
i do not remember
when you do do you tell the police
no way
i do not want to get involved
you think anyone else heard that
Probably
how many
i have got no idea
Really
if you are talking you can be sure someone's listening
but are not there anti bugging systems for cordless phones
there are things to break those
you can make them
they sell them
they follow the change in frequencies
they are called decipherers
how much are they
about Yen10 000
have you got one
not now
i used to
i see i wonder if someone will get there before us
you are going there
Sure
they weren't joking
that is the real thing
i do not know this could be trouble
do not worry
we will just do a long shot
we should tell the police
and what if it is just a joke
we will just go and check to see if it is true or not
Just wait there
here is something else
no it is gone
Picture it someone into wiretapping stumbles on
i do not wiretap
Whatever
It'd still make for a hell of a show
you know what might work
i could go look in the phone booth
they will just think you are making it up
we have got the voices to prove it is the real thing
Even if they believe that part they will still think it is being faked somewhere
yeah they say TV's faked but most people do not think so
Well a lot of it is faked
' Faked' is not the right word
Things are re enacted simply so viewers can understand
then they should say that
then there is no impact
we should tell the police
Idiot
how often do we get a scoop like this
yeah we can always call them if something goes wrong
that is right
we will tell them then
Let's go
it was around here was not it
where
this one
this building
that one up there
Right
can you go up closer to it
over there
yeah that is it
Go closer and stop
that is it right can you zoom in on the booths
the angle's not good
could you back up a bit
how is that
not much better
OK let's get out
we will shoot from over the crosswalk
that is a bit obvious
i can get you from here
you can
then i will go
you were rolling up until we stopped weren't you
yeah
that is OK
how should we do this
we will put the camera in the passenger's seat
i will talk outside the door
then the camera follows me as i go to the booth
that is dangerous
Keep quiet
we won't have our lights
will that be OK
i could boost the gain that might make it grainy
Good
it will look more real
that is what we will do
what should i say
Did we get those radio voices good and clear
they are fine
OK right let's go
Let's trade places
Hang on
Why not have the radio in the background
Why do not you talk from there
yeah why do not we do that
OK i will talk from in here
OK roll when ready
i will boost the gain
Rolling
was that shocking cellular phone conversation for real
i am at a phone booth at the West Exit of Shinjuku Station
i am going to find out
Turn on the light
can you see it
820 hold up the key
Like that
OK hold on it while i talk
Go ahead
as we heard on the phone there was a key in the booth
Cut
now on me
should we be moving
that might be better
yeah you are right
Kanemura could you pull over there by the entrance
you ready
Go ahead
is there really a pistol in the locker this key opens
i am going to a coin locker in Shinjuku Station to find out
OK
Man i never expected this
how are we for tape
we have got lots
you are going in
Well we are not going to quit and go home now
Let's stop here
Why not wait for the real guy to show up
Why
when he came we could call the police
They'd grab the pistol and you'd still have your scoop
Put the key back
no let's go on
we have come too far to stop now
we can not stop now
you bring the camera
you two wait here
here we go
Hold on the'Shinjuku Station' sign first
then pan down to me
here i go
Rolling
the stairway behind me leads down to the locker designated for the transfer
i am shaking uncontrollably
my heart pounds at the thought of a pistol awaiting me there
however i am going in
These are not the ones
Nope
that way
not here
there is nothing
there they are
this way
820 where is it
here it is
Let's go
Quick
was it there
yeah
Get in
i got it
Really
Come on
Get in
this is no time to fool around
Let's get moving
we got it
Let's get out of here
Too strong
Shine it down
more towards the camera
Watch the shadow from the seat
Starting from the face
yeah
Pan down to the box when i say i am going to open it
are we rolling
yes
here i go
Right
in the coin locker to which i have just been there was indeed a box
this is it
is there really a gun in this box
i will open it now
i am opening it
inside is a second box

it is heavy
is this it
yes it is
it is a pistol

Wait
Say something anything
i can not when i am on the spot like that
something like'I' m amazed' or'Wow'
will he make a comment
Why

Why not
i am behind him

Why did not you tell me that in the first place
i will get out
Bring the light out too Yoko

i will open it now
i am opening it
there is another box
i will open it
it is certainly heavy
i can feel the weight
here it is
a pistol
is it real
how do you feel seeing this
Wow
Cut
you do not look surprised at all
i have already seen it
Yoko repack this
we will take it again
Look the people watching this on TV haven't seen it before
the last time did not happen
you understand do not you
i am counting on you OK
what do i do
Just be a bit surprised
do not get mad at me
this is my first time
can not he just look at it
no i want him to say something
the show's about him

Ham it up as much as you want

Shocking is not it
Cut

Sounds good
Could've used more surprise

OK next i will hold the pistol up
Close in on it
then Kanemura's hand comes in and takes it

are we moving to a commune
we are just looking at it
we are fine where we are now
you sound like grandmother
i do not
yes you do
we won't move if you do not want to
i hope not
you have to see it yourself
if you judge others in advance you will never get wiser
okay i will take a look
but please take a real look
okay i do not like it
you can say hi to them
do they have a tennis court
hello
Anybody home
Oops
hello
hello
hi
hi Ingerlaise
we have brought Christoffer
hi
i am Ingerlaise
Damn it
i told you i did not want to
it is my husband Aksel
we are making a sweat lodge
what is that
it is some kind of Indian thing
something ritual
it is because we have a Sioux Indian living here
her name is Oglala
Come her you crazy troll
we will experiment with some of the Indian traditions
Doesn't it sound exiting Stoffer
Time will tell
Palle says it is a kind of spiritual sauna
what a surprise
Want to smoke
is it hash
yes of course
they are here
hi
hi
i am not doing this
Sure
i am not doing it
Stoffer
you promised you'd give it a chance
i am not taking off my clothes
it is a tradition which Oglala's grandparents have practised
Oglala's career focused parents haven't done it but her tribe has done it for thousands of years
Well
she is thanking me and of course you too that we can go into the hut together
she hopes it will be a success
it is a good idea to take off your clothes
it is really hot in there
yes but Christoffer is embarrassed to show his willy
before we go into the lodge we all have to say
to all my relations
Please
that is bloody stupid
we have to
i do not want to
we have agreed to
Let's say something political
Svend Erik
Let's do what we agreed to right
Let's all go into the lodge
you can not drink that
it is holy
are you unwell Stoffer
Stoffer
Maybe you should take off your shirt
Sit down
he is passing out
he is out of it
Remember to say
to all my relations before you leave
Mind the lodge
i am really sorry
it is not our fault that they have built a sweat lodge
we did not know that
i talked to the realtor
the house can be sold in a week
was not i supposed to approve the commune before we moved
of course it seems strange to you now
i am not moving
Nobody's said we are going to
no of course not
Goodbye Stoffer
See you
have a nice life
Goodbye
Goodbye
we should have discussed it some more with Stoffer
he will be fine
should not we have discussed it
we have talked and looked at communes for five years
you are happy and i am happy and so will Stoffer be in the end
i just think
Christoffer leads you a dance
i do not know about that
yes
you are pretty weak Nisse
Christoffer will get on
he will be a better collectivist than us
i get tired of you when you are so negative
be a bit more optimistic
Christoffer will be fine
you are probably right
i am not probably right
i am right
WELCOME OUR RED FRlENDS
how nice of you
is not that great Stoffer
do not cut the pieces too big
it is a hash cake
how much did you put in
10 12 grams
hello
we mainly share underwear
and shirts and things like that
and if there are no briefs
then you have to wear panties
you have got the best room
yes it is really nice
the ones before you were divorced
Really
they had some unbearable power struggles
they drove us all mad
Nis and i allow each other complete freedom right
yes completely
hi Tnnes
you are going to live here
with my son
do you want to jump
where is the toilet
did not you see it
Aksel the guy with the hash cake has built it all
it was before the fuel crisis
it is too expensive with the big tub
but once a month we fill up the tub and then we bathe together
are you looking for something
i am looking for room number 14
you are the new guy then
Come here
yes
Christoffer is our new pupil
he is from Hrsholm
will you tell us a bit about yourself
my name is Christoffer
i have moved into a house on Kongensvej with my mum and dad
they are architects
you can sit down
Let's find page 43 Jean Paul Sartre's Les jeux sont faits
what is the difference between a commune and a carpet store
in the carpet store a shag is not for free
in the commune
hello
hi
hi
how was school
Fine
that is great
we are doing great too
Nis has quit his job
i went to the technical department left my keys and said i wanted to build a dome house
they did not understand
when i was getting my things they went and bought these for me
we have another exciting surprise too
Make a guess
i am making political theatre with Tine and Ingerlaise
i am going inside
the news
there are new clues in the case about the bomber
this morning a woman was injured by a bomb in phone booth
what is that
Records of the bombs
Why
because bombs are cool
Why
because because because
the police thinks the bomber may be connected to the extreme left
what are you doing
Go sit on your bed
after collective cleaning on Saturday we can have candy and watch TV
i like Saturday
Shut up for a minute
can you see what that is Tnnes
yes
it is a chalk line
everything on the other side of that line is mine and mine alone
you can not touch any of my stuff
you can not talk to me
and if you tell on me then
then i will push you
and then it is goodbye
i won't tell anyone
hi
we are going to fuck
you are getting on well
yes
are not we Tnnes
Sure
Stoffer we are having a joint meeting
we are having a joint meeting
do i have to participate
yes
it is about you
at my school we make the children understand the capitalist society
a revolutionary insight
we do not want parrots
little verbalizing devils
no of course not
we give the children the strength independence and insight which is needed in the revolutionary battle
i do not want to
i do not want to
yes come on
Come on it will be over soon
Come on Tnnes
i do not want to
Christoffer do you want to tell us why you have tried to hang Tnnes
i just did it for fun
that is not funny at all
can not you see that
yes
Christoffer
what do you think we should do about it
i do not know
you could say you are sorry
i am sorry Tnnes
we think you should start going to Svend Erik's Maoist Saturday school
Why
it will be good for you
you will find an outlet for your aggression
you can aim them at capitalism
then you will get out of Saturday cleaning
Politiken says that another phone booth has been blown up and a 29 year old man has been severely injured
Ekstra Bladet calls the bomber slow and sluggish and a coward
Just look at his writing
the man is a psychopath
the mad bomber puts 600 children at risk it is a pity is not it
yes
that shows how easily you believe a press stunt
those children weren't at risk
it is a campaign against the bomber
they must have been at risk
no
it is a press stunt
do not you get it
the capitalist media describes the bomber as a psychopath
they are filling us with lies
what is really behind this
Revolutionary forces
Cityguerrillas
what impact will it have on the capitalist system
the revolution will come
if we show solidarity and support the path chosen it may very possibly lead to an armed revolution in Denmark
but that is up to you
LOUSY WAGES
the management at Royal Copenhagen makes the poor platter ladies work for almost nothing
but they have had enough
they have stood up
they are saying
we won't take it anymore
they are on strike
you will each get 150 posters which you have to put up
you have to work alone because what can they do
they can stop one they can not stop us all
if the police come then run
Run
if they catch you state only your name and address
the school can not get into the police files
when you are done come back here by 5 p m
at the latest
what if we are not done
then you bring back the rest of the posters
Spread out
Christoffer was the most efficient partisan
he put up 150 posters in an hour and a half
was not it hard
i ran out of paste too but then i went and bought some more
with your own money
yes ten kroner
Take it from the common purse
of course
Well done
to think that is my son
it is important to think for yourself
he is a great revolutionary talent
Haven't i always said so Nisse
it is great that you are getting on Stoffer
it is great
there is a really good atmosphere
should not we meditate on it
no
Brothers fire your weapons the final battle is near victory is upon us brothers in the working army Louder
Victory is upon us brothers in the working army Clench your fist
Sing out loud
Raise your well armed fist brothers we are fighting for peace do not let your threats be empty
lightning must strike at our foes do not let your threats be empty
hi
what are you doing
i do not know
Want to do something
Let's listen to it at your house
can not we go to your house
it won't really work
my record player is broken
Come on
Let's listen to it at your house
Come on
i do not know who that is
hi Stoffer
Won't you come say hi
hi
i am Stoffer's mum
hi i am Julie
Stoffer you are wearing my blouse
it looks ridiculous
yes
are you lesbians
no
Tine and me just like each other
what a great mum
the way she is open and honest
i really like her
hi Stoffer
that is my dad
hi i am Julie
Nisse
i was hoping you'd help me with the dome house
Why are you wearing a dress
it is a djellaba
it is very comfortable
it doesn't squeeze your willy
Cool
it is just hanging there and
Dangling
that is Tnnes who i share a room with
Weren't you going to help Nis with the dome house
i have often walked by and felt like knocking on the door
you should just have come in
do you mean it
we are all very open
is it yours
yes
are you red
yes but only on Saturday
you can not just be red on Saturday
then i am red all week i guess
that is cool
we carry out some wild protests
and the cops show up
Exactly
it sounds totally exciting
it is
the revolution is just around the corner
there is a joint meeting
Nisse we are having a joint meeting
i have invited Pia and Carla
hi from the platter ladies' strike committee to the party tonight
Maybe we can make something happen
i have promised the picket that we will make a protest against Royal Copenhagen tonight
what kind of protest

Emergency 911
i want to report a wife battering
what is the address
Kongensvej 6
he is beating her
what is the address
Kongensvej number 6
what is going on
Aksel's gone completely crazy
Leave them alone
we have been through it hundreds of times and it always end with Ingerlaise defending Aksel
there is nothing we can do about it
but some day Ingerlaise will be ready to receive our support
and then we have to be there and support her 100
no
hello
hello
we have been called to the premises
yes
Aksel Jensen has beaten his wife
this way please
we are going through the kitchen
she is the one who was beaten
hello
you have been beaten by your husband
no i just tripped
we have been notified about a case of wife battering
where is the husband
he is sitting in there
Did you beat your wife
no i haven't
that is a lie
the hell it is
he did not
he did not
we have been here all morning
i am sorry
it is alright
we are used to it
i will see you out
who is the owner of this hash
the police have received about 1 300 tips
Today several telephone bombs and strange parcels showed up
the police put up cordons in Copenhagen
Turn off that crap
we think it is a psychotic deviant
he belongs in a mental hospital
it is a press stunt
be quiet
the bomber is alright
Killing innocent people can not be justified in any way
if it is so dangerous they can take off the doors
they can not take off all phone booth doors
Great idea
Call him and say so
Just do not use a phone booth
Quiet
Stoffer
i am in the bushes
Stoffer i am in the bushes
Shit
Get out in a hurry
Go to the Maoist school and destroy all material on the protest
there are cops everywhere
Did they find out
no not yet
Hurry up damn it
i am sorry that your sheep have to go
you have to abide by the law like everyone else
Goodbye for now
Bloody male chauvinists
they have gone through our underwear
Traitor
i am really sorry
Tell the sheep when they are being slaughtered
Let's clear the air of these bad vibrations
if we sat down with Oglala
Shut up Palle
Palle we are not into that trip
do you realize that your son who is carried out an important protest has to run away
if he has to run away he is on a downward path
if Christoffer wants to take action he should be allowed to
Hear hear
i knew you were stupid but that you are stupid enough to call the cops is beyond me
you are an idiot
you can say that again
i am having a hard time concentrating
it is completely ridiculous
yes it is bad
i think we should move back to Hrsholm
do you think that is a good idea
yes i do
i was going to move in with Tine for a while
we are performing tomorrow and i can not concentrate around you
then cancel the performance
i can not
i have to act
we are rehearsing in the garden
i am coming
Nisse do not take it personally
our relationship will fall apart if we do not stay apart for a while
what is going on
i am going to Norway
to Norway
i am going to the mountains
i need to be alone
Nisse damn it
is it because of Maria
no not at all
do not let a woman get you down
you will be fine in a couple of days
i need to go into nature
i feel like i am suffocating
what about our dome houses
you will have to build them yourself
Nisse sit down
we have to talk about this
i will make some tea
it can not bloody well be right
no i can not
i just can not
what a cool place
yes
will you keep an eye on Christoffer when he shows up
i am a bit worried about him
i will look after him
yes
we will telepath you when we find him
you are nice
Oglala's made it herself
it will protect you against evil spirits
See you
See you
I'd better get going
the police are interested in the whereabouts of Christoffer Hammer
the police have connected him to the bomb in Smallegade
in his home a collective farm in Frederiksberg
Maria Maria
Yesterday you were filled with complexes and fear you did not feel you could cope
Maria they are talking about Stoffer on the radio
you thought what do i want
Woman stand up and learn we have to fight together against fear and defeat we have to do what we are afraid to every day woman fight for it to happen
they are talking about Stoffer
Tnnes we can not concentrate
Tnnes you promised to go put on your clothes
we are going to Den Gr Hal
i do not want to go
we do not have time to discuss it
you are stupid mum
i want to be with Nisse
Palle can not you look after Tnnes today
Tine we are taking the sheep away
it is tough enough as it is
Aksel baby
Aksel baby
we have had a joint meeting
you have to look after Tnnes
i did not agree to that
would not it be nice
the hell it would
you do not have to tidy up
i will do it tomorrow
if you will just look after Tnnes
Hell no
i do not want to
i have a thousand things to do
you have to stay here
Let her go
do not be such a dick
you have to take the responsibility
Tnnes is crying upstairs
they do not mean it like that
Come on Ingerlaise
Bye Tnnes
Aksel will look after you
See you tomorrow
you pigs
hi

Sure
Go get it then
i have taken all of the money because i have given you too much
Fuck you
Stoffer
Stoffer
Dear Stoffer
i have gone home to do some stuff
See you
Julie
Stoffer
Stoffer
Stoffer something totally amazing has happened
the cops think you are the bomber
what
they think it is you
you are kidding
no it is bloody well true
it is a great opportunity
we will call the Chinese embassy and tell them you want to hide and appear as the bomber in the media
you will be the Danish Andreas Baader
we will become terrorists
Join the bloody battle for revolution
Svend Erik that sounds completely stupid
the police are convinced that you are the bomber
you will get ten years in the nick
they can not do that
you will go to the nick
the police want a scapegoat
Stop it
i am not getting involved
if you are not with us you are against us
and then you are a capitalist pig and we will get you then
do you know what you are trying to stop
do this thing or you are finished
Christoffer if we stick together then nothing bad can happen and then nothing can stop us
do not you see
Good
my beloved comrades we have all looked forward to this moment
now the time for waiting and training is over
this is an open confrontation with the system
and all that is thanks to Stoffer
Long live Stoffer
Long live the revolution
Long live the revolution
Long live the revolution
i am not calling them
do not worry
i will do it
this will have an enormous impact
Huge numbers of people will come
how do you know that
Remember Ulrike Meinhof's funeral
no
5 000 people were there
there is your lunch
there is no entrance
Password
if you do not let me in i will get the cops
so are you going to stay here
yes
Look at that
we are going to have a massive demonstration
Plenty of people are going to back us up
we can stay here until they catch the real bomber
is Svend Erik behind all this
no
it can not be you
Sure it is
this is the worst plan i have ever heard of
do not worry
it is going to be fine
this is going to work out just great
Alright Stoffer i
i will wait here
okay
have you got everything
yes
Make sure they understand that we will be contacting them tomorrow
okay
Good
Red front
Red front
you are under arrest
what were you doing at the Rialto Theatre
i already told you
what were you doing
i smashed a store window
Why
to support the platter ladies
you brought a bomb
no
how many people do you want to hurt
i have got nothing to do with that shit
Svend Erik says you made all the bombs
it is not true
Sure
he is in the other room crying his eyes out
he claims you made him call the Chinese embassy
do you want an armed revolution
Stop it
you might as well confess
we have got loads of evidence
Send him to the magistrate
you will be isolated until you confess
Long live the revolution
you will never win
Get your hands off me
Long live the proletariat
Avanti popolo
what a shitty country
can not you see i am starving
and if we do not agree then we won't be free traitors and overlords traitors and overlords and we do not agree then we won't be free traitors and overlords they must all die i licky licky lie our numbers grow and grow socialists are we yes socialists are we
the place is packed
this is going to be a huge success
i am so bloody nervous
Freedom's what we want
do not be nervous
Just be yourself
Why do not i tell them that we only rehearsed six times
you have worked on this play for an entire year
this is going to be great
Repeat after me
we are strong independent and free
we are strong independent and free
we are strong independent and free
Sisters the rest of the evening is cancelled
there is been a meeting at the factory and we are to return to work and even pay a fine of 3 3 million kroner
the committee's done a great job
they must feel really awful now
there is nothing to celebrate
Thanks for coming
we spent the whole day dealing with her husband
you are so far out
the world doesn't revolve around your shit marriage
i know
do something about your pathetic life
Cool down Tine
you can stuff your sketches
you write then
i am sick of you and your boring little plays
do not fucking push me
Move back to the suburbs wifey
that is where you belong
you move bitch
you are so self absorbed
then find somewhere else to live
i have something very serious to talk to you about
it is about Christoffer
i see a beautiful meadow with light green trees and bushes
there is a little mouse there
she says it is your totem animal
you will see through its eyes and hear through its ears
i am racing along the ground
Wow everything's so big
there is a huge black snake right in front of me
she says
do not be afraid
Follow the snake
it will guide you
there is a girl on a rocking horse
it is my rocking horse
and my old dress
she wants to know where the snake is
there is a very bright light
the snake dissolves into the light
that was so wonderful
Help me
Help me
Nisse help me
Help me
i am coming
do not be afraid
i am coming
Help
Pack your things
during the socialists' gathering
the so called bomber tried to blow up the communists' stand
the bomb went off in his hands
he was injured and arrested
a year of terror has come to an end
i do not know where your parents are
we have notified them
there is a bus around the corner
Alright
it went boom boom when the bomber blew up
Am i awfully late

WELCOME HOME STOFFER
they are here
hi
we have prepared a meditation session for you
we all agreed to try to become more well balanced beings
Oglala's going to help us turn the house into a spiritual centre before she goes home
we are using the dome house for meditation
but Aksel's handyman skills are missed
Aksel's moved out
he took the common purse and left
i am so sorry
it must have been rough for you
yes but afterwards when you get out you feel all groovy
we have got a new room for you
you won't be sharing it
i am doing seances with Oglala
we are exploring our inner landscapes
i have a bear inside me and it is always there for me
while we wait for Christoffer to join us
i think we should think really positively about Stoffer
Think of him out in nature
at peace with the trees and bushes
Naked
Please
it is cool
then nothing's squeezing my willy

what are you thinking
you never told me about your relationship with your mother
i did not did l
Really i am here to help you
you can talk to me
this is a safe environment
you are right
we could talk about your daddy instead
we could talk about my mother my father my aunts or my sister or my brother but none of it is gonna help you
you do not even i ike me
have we not been in this room together for like a year discussing your life
does that mean we like each other because we discuss my i ife
i can not speak for you
i can only speak for me and i do like you
i do
so are you ltalian or
what color are you anyway
are you some type of black or Spanish
what color do you think i am
no I'd like to know
what color do you think i am
my throat is dry
Your throat is dry
it is really hot in here
it is kind of hot in here
i am gonna go get a soda
what do you want
Soda sou nds fine
all right
Thank you
no problem
so i have to talk to you about your mother and i do not know how you are gonna feel about this but she says she wants to see you and she wants to be reu n ited with you and her grandchildren
she wants to come and have a session here with you
what did you tell her
i said i had to speak to you about it
it is up to you
i do not know
i never thought about it before
Ms Weiss said in that file i got HlV
she said i was supposed to die from it
i ain't worried about dying
Shit i gotta worry about how i am supposed to raise these kids
i was just writing like about
i wanna open up this clinic about i ike mothers and their children
you know just if they are sick or something like that
i always wanted to do that give back to the community
because i know my mom would be proud of me if i did that and my children too
i want my children to be proud of their mother you know
that is always what i wanted to do so
that is good
that is really nice
i do not really want to read the whole thing i kind of just wanna say what it is about
okay the counselors at Advanoement House they were quizzing me about my mother and my father right
but it is not really about them
they are trying to get me to do workfare
they want me to be a home attendant
how do you know
because i stole my file and i read it
all they want me to do is work
now i do wanna work but not for no welfare check
what kind of sense that make for somebody like Precious to quit school before she got her G ED and go work for some old white people somewhere
she ain't never gonna be nothing if she gets stuck in some shit like that
Rhonda used to home attend
she used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach
yeah okay Rhonda wou ld be worki ng there all day and night
She'd be on call right
she made 6
3 7 an hour but for only eight hours
that eq ual out to 50
96
but that is not a whole lot of money especially'cause for real she there for 2 4 hours
so 50 96 divided by 2 4 is 2
1 2 an hou r
that is not a lot of money
she said that old bitch wou ld ring a bell like a real life actual bell when she wanted something from her in the middle of the n ight
you do not want to do that shit
Rhonda is that true
Rhonda
them home attendants be working for like six days a week
I'd only see Abdul on Sunday plus I'd have to leave class
Well that is not an option
you are not leaving class plus i am gonna start goi ng to insect survivor meeti ngs
it is incest
that ain't what i said
no you said insect
what is the difference
Well one's where your family molests you the other's like a roach or bugs
so you a scientist now
i am just saying
no that is cool
Thank you
Thank you
it was hard telling them strangers there what my father did
sometimes it felt good
last week Ms Rain asked us to write down what we wanna be Iike
i wrote that i be real skinny with Ilght skin and long hair
Loretha Holloway
Go on back there
she read it and said i am beautiful like i am
but there is no kids back there for me to play with
J ust shut up and sit there then
Gonna talk to this lady before my shit gets cut off
but somehow right now
and i do not know why but
i think she right
here
Claireece Jones
i think she right
okay Mrs Johnston let's tal k about the abuse
there were no drugs in my house
i did not play that
there weren't no drugs in my house
Precious knew i wou ld whup her ass if she gonna bri ng some d rugs up in my house
you know what i am talking about
i am referring to specific sexual and physical acts involving Precious
Why you ain't say that
yes that
what do you wanna know
According to Precious' files she has now had two ch ildren by your boyfriend the late Carl Kenwood Jones who was also her father
yeah
this is accurate
yes Ms Weiss
i need to know why you are here
you have been calling this office saying you want to be reunited with Precious and your grandchild
now i really need to know what is gone on in that home
Ms Weiss i understand we need to discuss it but i am just telling you
you said i have been call ing here and i have been wanting to see
Precious and my grandson
you are goddamn right i wanna see them
because they belong to me
okay
now there was a time Precious had everything and i done told her that
and me and Carl we loved Precious
and you need to know that
we loved Precious and we had dreams
Precious was born around the same time Ms West's son got kil led
the su mmertime
she was born in the summertime
Remember
Remember that
i was born in November
November
yeah that is right
my Scorpio child
you know
Scorpios they can be tricky
and i am not sayi ng that they lie
i am not saying that
but you just gotta watch them
can we talk about the actual acts of physical and sexual abuse that occurred in your household
when it first began where it happened and how did you respond
Precious was a little girl
Try and remember how old you think she was
she was three
and i had been giving her the bottle and i was g iving Carl the tittie because my m ilk hadn't d ried u p in my breasts but not from her but because Carl was
because Carl was sucking on them and that is what kept my milk in my breasts
and i thought that that was for hygiene
i did what my mother told me that i was supposed to do with my child so that is what i d id
and you are sitting u p there and you are trying to judge me
i am not judging you but you are asking me for money and you are aski ng me to be reunited with your grandson
but Ms Weiss i do not like you looking at me like that
you got this bitch looki ng at me like i am some kind of fucking monster
we do not talk like this i n my office okay
i did not want her suoking behind him because that was nasty
and th ings that he was
it was just nasty Ms Weiss
i had a man and i have a ch ild and i had to take care of both of them
okay
Did i want Carl to touch my baby
because i would lay my baby
i would lay her on the side of me on this pillow and it was pink and it had this little white writing on it and it had her name because she was Precious
and i would lay my baby on that pillow and Carl would be laying on the other side and then we would
we would start doing it and he reached over and he touched my baby
and i asked him
i said Carl what are you doing
and he told me to shut
to sh ut my fat ass up and it was good for her
and what did you do then
i sh ut my fat ass up
and i do not want you to sit there and judge me Ms Weiss
you shut up and you let hi m abuse your daughter
i did not want him to abuse my daughter
i d id not want hi m to hurt her
but you al lowed hi m
to hurt her
i d id not want him to do nothing to her
i wanted h im to make love to me
that was my man
that was my fucking man
that was my man and he wanted my daughter
and that is why i hated her
because my man who was supposed to be loving me who was supposed to be making love to me was fucking my baby
she made him leave
she made him go away
so whose fault was it then
it is this bitch's fau it because she let my man have her and she d idn't say nothing
she did not scream
she did not do nothing
so those things she told you i did to her who else was gonna love me
since you got your degree and you know every fucking thing who was gonna love me who was gonna make me feel good
who was gonna touch me and make me feel good late at night
and she made him go away so
when you sit there and you write them fucking notes on your pad about who you th ink i am and why i did it all of that
because i did not have nobody
the people from
each one Teach one they had
they called me and they told me that my baby was writing poems
ln fact you know what i got
Wait a minute
i am sorry
i am sorry
and Ms Weiss i do not want no checks
i do not need no more money please
i am so sorry
i took that TABE test again
and what happened
i scored a 7
8
last time it was 2
8
Accordi ng to that test
i am reading at a seventh and eighth grade level
next year high school
Atter that college
Well i like you too
but you can not handle me
you can not handle none of this
you know i never knew what you was until this day
not even atter all them things you did
Maybe i was too stupid or maybe i just did not want to
you ain't gonna see me no more
Bye
i did not want him to h urt my baby
Please God i did not want him to h urt my baby
Ms Weiss i did not want him to h urt my baby
i would say to him i would say
Carl what are you doing
what are you doing
what are you doing
can you go get her back
you can do that because that is what you do
that is what you do
i need you to go and i need you to get my baby back
you told me that i could come in here and you cou ld get
you could get Precious to say
Ms Weiss
Ms Weiss
Ms WeissGoing once

Scooby dooby doo
Sync by n17t01 www addic7ed com
Like Scooby doo
there is something about putting a teeny tiny umbrella in your drink
that just makes it better
yeah
i heard that
now this is purely hypothetical
but let's say your extravagant grotto was haunted by a pool monster
Want to know how I'd trap it
uh could you tell me later
first I'd use some combination of shag or scoob to lure him under the waterfall
then I'd add quick drying cement to the water and boo yah
Trapped
oh shaggy
Like my new bikini
um like i do not know
are you wearing one
yes
i just do not want to get burned
do you have any idea of how damaging the sun is
Give me a call when someone wants to make a leathery handbag out of your back fat
Hey do not worry Velma
i think you look great
and with the sun reflecting off your pale colorless skin
we can blind the monster and just push him into the pool with the cement already in it
Genius
Fred
Boy am i steamed
what is wrong mom
a vampire ruined my auction last night
Vampire
a mystery
Quick Velma
Set your milky whiteness for stun Mmm
Fred
what
it is OK Daphne
i do not care what Fred thinks
Guys mystery
Time's running out
Go let's
i am not solving any mystery if he is going to be there
you know Fred maybe we should split up
it is too early
we can not split up until we get
to a haunted amusement park or a terrifying cavern
Actually dude like i think splitting up is a good idea
yeah
you have already made that perfectly clear
Ok then
we will be splitting up
so where shall we start
i am thinking pedicures
Like is it me or does this feel weird
yeah it is strange mysterying without the girls
no i mean sitting shotgun
Ha ha
Like i never get to ride up here
it is awesome
Stereo
yeah
if you were a vampire where would you hide out
the clam cabin
the pizza pail
Right
Let's try the cemetery
Velma here is the only thing you will
they are stupid
if you give a boy two choices
a smart one and a stupid one he will always make the stupid one every time
that is why you never give them a choice
that is depressing
yes it is but what can you do
Boys look really cute in ascots
where is your mom going at this hour
Beats me
Mom
where are you going
me
oh
Well um i am just running out to the grocery store
to get some uh Pate
yeah
Pate
Mm hmm
See you later
Weird
my mom is duck intolerant
Pate gives her the squeakers real bad
Something's up
Come on
what about our massages
Sorry Velma
Duty before beauty
the lady at the blood bank said they haven't seen a vampire tonight or any night
Actually her exact words were out of my blood bank freakwad
is is that b b blood
what
oh no
i just snagged a red punch juice box and spilled some
they have got tons hanging all over the place
so that is a big fat no on the cemetery the zoo's bat exhibit and the blood bank
what now
i am running out of ideas
i got it
Fruitmeyer's
Scoob
that is genius
it is a little out of the box but everyone loves fruitmeyer's even vampires
she is gone
she is a freak
she is the fastest mom alive
she speed walks every morning
Well your mom must have thighs like tree trunks
' cause we totally lost her
she has got to be around here somewhere
a light's on at the botanical gardens
this makes no sense
my mom hates nature
she hates anything she doesn't have to pay for
Like man i do not get girls
yeah
Chicks
Why do not um i do not know Fred
Trust me
nothing says i love you
Like 200 feet of parachute cord and a cargo net
Hey what was that
it came from down the hill
i bet you clams to casino that our vampire's inside the greenhouse
Mmm clams
what do we do now Fred
we trap ourselves a vampire
Hey Freddy where do you get this stuff
Trap mart
i am a premier member of the frequent trappers club
Eww
Smells like that stuff you put on plants to help them grow
you mean poo
yeah
that is what it smells like
that is a two inch thick bone in ribeye with perfect marbling
no self respecting vampire will be able to resist it
i know i can not
Somebody's coming
Ha
Gotcha
Hit the lights
Fred
what are you doing
Shaggy get me out of here
now
Like um you look nice
Save it
what was that
what do we do
we are doing it
Yikes
Run
Fred
do not let go of me
do not worry Daph
i would not
Think of it
Ah nuts
Scoob like i think the exit is this way
Why did we have to go vampire hunting
Yikes
Yikes
Help
Help
what the hoosit now
huh
Help
Prickers
is everyone OK
how are you doing hero
Like i have been better
oh
you do not really care though do you
my star orchid
it is gone
i do not get it
what would a vampire want with a painting and an orchid
i do not care if there was a weather delay
when i order a crate full of Sumatran rat monkeys
from skull island i expect overnight delivery
those things get stale fast
if we are going to find out what this vamp is up to we need to do some research
Hey mom
oh hey kids
to what do i owe the pleasure
Mrs Dinkley we need some information on vampires
Vampires
oh sugar plums you have come to the right place
the broken spine has the most extensive collection of bloodsucker lit
this side of the Carpathian mountains
huh
there must be something in here that will tell us
Why a vampire would want a painting and an orchid
hello
is someone there
Wow
you just do not like this shelf
oh for crying out loud
who are you
the answers you seek
are inside
but wait
who are
you
there is nothing in any of these books about a painting or an orchid
i guess we have hit a dead end
more like an undead end
Guys i think i found what we are looking for
it is an old Halloween issue of celebrities weekly
and on page 128 is
countess hagula's youth juice
4 essential ingredients and eternal youth can be all yours
but this is just a stupid Halloween prank
Looks like someone did not get the joke
the pigment from our stolen painting and the pollen of a star orchid
this is it
our vampire must be trying to make some youth juice
Good work Daphne
Mm hmm
yeah
and like nice call Velma on coming here
Too little too late
if we want to know where the vampire is going to strike next
we just need to check the recipe
then we can get there first and trap her in a trap
Look
Vino
a chateau Le Rouge crimson Ruby rose Bordeaux 1911
there is only one restaurant in town that has a wine list extensive enough
to include that vintage
the crab net of Dr Calimari
Dr Calimari's has a very strict dress code
if we are going to get in we will have to look the part
i think it is time for you to leave sheriff
now Mrs Blake all i did was suggest that you are dressing up like a she vamp
and stealing random objects
no reason to get all mad about it
Mom
what is going on
the sheriff thinks i have something to do with these vampire attacks
Thank goodness Sheila was here
Aah
Yikes
oh Nan do not you worry your flawlessly skinned
Perfectly coiffed head about this
it is just a misunderstanding
my mom is not behind this
we have to clear her name
Guys let's go to dinner
Welcome to the crab net of Dr Calimari
Bon sweer
my chums and i would like your finest table
but first we need to inspect your uh wine cellar
Oui oui
Oui oui
Oui oui
Oui oui
do you have a reservation
no reservation no table
Like uh i need to use your bathroom my good man
Oui oui
oh yeah
me too
Oui oui
Oui oui
i am good
i went before we left
Ooh
oh yeah
Ahem
Bathroom
Right
Oui oui
me too
Oui oui
Oui oui
of course
it is just down the hall
Oui oui
Oui oui
what is my mom doing here
and how did she beat us
there is the wine cellar
Let's go
Like where is everybody going
i really have to use the bathroom
Yipe
Listen if we are gonna find that bottle we better split up
Velma you and shaggy
i do not like my partner
Really
Well like i am tired of being your guilt bucket
i want a new partner too
Guys we have to work as a team if we are gonna catch Daphne's mom in the act
and prove once and for all that she is an undead bloodsucker
Fred
Face it gang
Maybe we are not a team anymore
Ditto on that uh oh
Yipe
Yipe
that wine will be mine
Yipe
Everybody in here
no
Fools
everybody in here nice
how was i supposed to know we'd get locked in by your mom
it is a cage Fred
you always want to stay on the outside of a cage
and that is not my mom
Ah
i do not think
one more ingredient
and i will have eternal youth forever
Like man we are totally off our game
Seriously
the final ingredient in the recipe is
a priceless cursed Ruby called the devil's eye
i know that jewel
it is gorgeous
it is also on display at the Darrow university oddities museum
then that is where we will be
Ok so my last trap was a complete failure
but this one is so complicated it is got to work
something about this just doesn't make sense
if vampires do not age why bother with an eternal youth potion
here we go
Get ready everybody
oh no
Mom it is you
Daphne for trap's sake we are in the middle of something here
Mom
Mom
i want that Ruby
Mom stop this
the devil's eye
Finally i will have the eternal youth
of a vampire
oh i do not think so ghoulfriend
i switched the rubies when we got here
that one is a fake
Deploy the second net
yeah
yeah
Let me go
i will drain you all
Mom
Your vampiring is tearing this family apart
i am sorry but you have left me no choice
i am going to have to stake you
Wait
i am not a vampire
i am
Sheila Altoonian
but why
is not it obvious
my looks are starting to fade
no
no
you are gorgeous
Your skin is as tight as my ascot
this is all your mother's fault
we are the same age but she is so beautiful
she has the skin of a teenager
that is when i realized
she must be a vampire
i went to the dinkley shop to do a little research
and found the recipe for the youth juice
that potion was gonna make me young and beautiful forever
you see in college i majored in zoology and acrobatics studying the habits of flying squirrels
i propelled myself into the air with my quad and glute muscles
all this gave me the illusion of a real flying vampire
Why did not you just try maybe wearing a little less makeup
or a cuter haircut
or use tape to pull back all your wrinkly sacks of you know age gracefully
Age gracefully
are you crazy
no the vampire serum was my only hope
and i would have gotten away with it if it was not for you meddling
what is going on here
Mom
Even now she is stealing my moment
i am so glad you are not an undead creature of darkness
Thanks honey
but what are you doing here
Why have you been sneaking out
i did not want to say anything but
i have been taking night classes
i am getting my public notary degree
oh how exciting
what an opportunity
you know i may be outrageously gorgeous but knowledge
Knowledge is the key to true beauty
Well i better get going
i have to figure out what a notary is before tomorrow's final exam
another mystery solved
yeah
Well see you guys
i guess
yeah
Heh
i uh
Better call it a night so uh
Trap you later
Listen Velma i am
good night Norville
Looks like it is just me and you Scooby doo
yeah
it will be OK
you will see

everyone
it is like the world ended
i could not even buy a cup of coffee
that should be against some kind of law
Morning to you too sunshine
Want to know why i am not in a great mood this morning Wade
Hmm
it is because a Hitchcockian swarm of flies were buzzing in my ear all night long
and you want to know why i have flies
because your front porch is a cemetery for takeout containers empty beer bottles and half eaten waffles
i told you you should fix that hole in your screen
yeah and you told me that you would fix it
Maybe
but you should be nicer to me
' Cause when all those nice churchgoing people get whooshed up to Heaven in the Rapture gonna be just me and you left to repopulate the Earth
Listen cowboy i have a very important week coming up
Brick has left for his fishing trip which means i finally have the practice all to myself
so i need to be better than great so that the patients still see me even after Brick gets back
but i can not do that if i haven't had any sleep
Cowboy
Cowboy
so Daddy's gone we should make the most of it
Romantic night
Romantic night huh
Mm hmm
you mean no father no little sister no uh no 13th committee members
oh no baby just you and me
all night
all night
Why Lemon Breeland are you planning on uh seducing me
i may be
i am on the fence though
Maybe i should give you a little push
so we are on then
Mm hmm
but not tonight or tomorrow night because i have to finish my project for the Memory Matrons
how is Thursday sound
Thursday sounds fine
Well except it might be a little late
i am going to be taking depos out in Mobile and well you know how rough that road back can be
i was stuck behind a tractor for an hour last week
okay well then late it shall be
and i am going to pamper you sweetheart because i hate that you have been working so much
oh it is okay
Look a lot of good people got defrauded in the spill
and this class action suit is going to help them out
besides Mobile is growing on me
the guys took me to this amazing
little tapas place last week
Tapas
yeah
since when do you like tapas
i do not know
a while
i will tell you what we should go sometime
of course
Tapas
Yum
of course we should
i can not wait
not Thursday though
oh there is Delia Ann
i better go compliment her outfit
she is picking out the new head of the Mobile Bay Memory Matrons this week
all right
i will see you
oh Delia Ann
Delia Ann
Well hello there
hello
hi
i am the Reverend Mayfair
this is my wife Beverly
how do you do
uh listen uh if this is about that whole church door thing this morning
i am so sorry
oh no
do not you bother yourself about that at all
no no
Actually we are here to officially welcome you to BlueBell
okay this is the point where you hand me a pamphlet or something
Excuse me
you give me a cake and then i have to come tour a time share in the rectory or something
i do not know what you are used to sweetie but down here a Bundt cake is just a Bundt cake
so you do not want me to come to church
no of course we want you to come to church
you are just not trying to get me to come to church
you are very welcome to come to church
if i take this Bundt cake it is not an implied contract that i will come to church
um we will just leave the cake right here on the porch and you can decide
and uh on the first Sunday of every month we host a pancake breakfast and we hope you can come
uh but you do not have to
do not have to
Bye bye
all right
Bye bye
Nice meeting you
hi
i am Lavon Hayes and i am itch free where it counts
hi
i am Zoe Hart and i am freaked out at the moment
this jock itch cream wants me as their spokesperson
Did you believe me
that you are itch free where it counts
yeah but i do not want to think about it
you know it is commercial and a print campaign the works
Very lucrative offer
but it is humiliating right
not unless you want the whole world to think you used to have rashy junk
and no it is
what is with the cake
oh
it is a quote unquote present from the friendly neighborhood preacher and his wife
oh the Mayfairs
yeah they seem to think it is okay to drop in unannounced and bully you into coming to church
Zoe the Mayfairs are kind people
i am sure they were just trying to be good neighbors
in New York being a good neighbor is leaving each other alone
yeah well BlueBellers are not exactly known for leaving anything alone
they are doing a pretty good job of it ignoring my practice
Ooh speaking of which
oh
yeah
Big week huh
Ding dong the Brick is gone
Cake
Sure
Why not
hello
Dr Hart's office
Only Dr Hart no one besides Dr Hart
Dr Hart speaking
hello
i am Dr Hart the one and only doctor who will be taking care of you today
oh great
i am Addy Pickett and i am the one and only nurse who will be taking care of you today
what
Brick asked if i could help out this week
Figured you might need a hand
Brick thinks i need a babysitter
Whoa
i am no babysitter
i am a registered nurse with 15 years of experience eight of which were here with Harley and Brick so i know this office like the back of my hand
so i believe the words you are looking for are
Thanks Addy
Appreciate the help
Hey Doc
Crazy Earl needs a once over
what happened
Old man was passed out drunk underneath my boat trailer
i backed over him
you ran over him
i did not
Sit down
i did not run over him okay
i was going fishing and i backed over him with my boat trailer which weighs next to nothing
Sir are you having any trouble breathing
okay we do not need to do that anymore
Pulse is fine
See there
he is drunk as a skunk
you could not hurt him if you tried
now all the good fishing spots are going to be gone
Really
you ran over him and you are annoyed
Like i randomly check to see if anyone happens to be passed out underneath my boat
i was asleep
you are pretty
and you are lucky
no broken bones your abdomen it is soft and non tender
i think you are going to be fine
no thanks to you
Let's get you in there to lie down
i think you could use a nap
the last time i tried that i got run over
Backed over
oh Dr Hart
here are some test results that just came in
Normally I'd leave them for Brick seeing as how it is his patient and all but these look a little time sensitive
okay
what what test results
Peter Mayfair
Looks like he was in last week
Ah yes the good and right Reverend Mayfair
Sprained halo
not exactly
Syphilis
Reverend Mayfair and his wife are on their way over
both of them
Well i only asked for Peter to come but you know how they are
Well they are always together
it is inspiring really a true love story
oh that is funny i do not remember the syphilis part in Romeo and Juliet
Watch your tongue
that is our preacher you are talking about
i am sorry
do we have any other patients scheduled for today
Nope
of course it is not a surprise
you are not exactly assimilating
but i listen to the words of Reverend Mayfair
i want to be a good Christian woman so i will give you a tip
how is my hair look
what
how is my hair look
Bigger than it did two hours ago
Exactly
Standing appointment at the salon every Monday
now do i need my hair done once a week
no i do not
but the beauty parlor is the absolute best place to bond gossip show the people in this town you are serious about being one of them and maybe even pick up a patient or two
Really
yeah you should give it a try maybe fix those highlights while you are at it
all right
i guess beauty parlor i can do
Let me call Susie butter her up for you
oh y'all have a seat
Thank you Addy
Dr Hart we meet again
Listen Mrs Mayfair
i have to go over your husband's test results so if you would not mind just waiting outside
Dr Hart that is all right
we share everything
yeah about that
i just think that you'd be more comfortable
it is fine Dr Hart
if Peter has anything at all wrong with him
i need to be here
we realize you did not call him in here to tell us he was fine
okay
Just gonna come right out and say it
you have tested positive for syphilis
but the good news is it is easily cured
Just a round of antibiotics and you are all set
i am sorry i do not understand
is is there some other kind of syphilis other than the the one
Did you possibly mean psoriasis
his skin is unusually dry
no i meant syphilis
Dr Hart i am married
for 23 years
Clearly there is been some sort of mix up down at the lab
now this kind of thing must happen all the time right
sometimes
not really
i guess technically it is possible
Well there you are you see
so let's just retake that test and i am sure this whole thing will be cleared up
or maybe maybe we should wait for Dr Breeland to come back
no
no i will run it again
now i do not want to alarm you or cause you any more discomfort than you are already feeling but we need to test you too
it is a matter of propriety

and our beautiful bridge was taken from our warm embrace and with that
Mr Mayor our hopes and our dreams
okay was that too much hopes and dreams
no it is perfect
so dramatic
then came the storm
okay now y'all just ruined it
oh Lemon relax
Why are you so nervous
Delia Ann Lee put me in charge of this okay
Delia Ann Lee herself
i think that she is grooming me to take over the Memory Matrons just like just like my mama did
i did not even think she liked you
it is called tough love AnnaBeth
all right you are always hardest on the ones you like the most
Like in an Officer and a Gentleman
yes like an Officer and a Gentleman mm hmm
but ladies i can only get the nod if i can convince the mayor to use the redevelopment funds to rebuild the bridge
so hopefully my candy diorama will sway him
Mayor Hayes has a huge sweet tooth
oh it is in the bag
Mm hmm
there is no way the mayor won't love your presentation
i hate these stupid presentations
i swear it is the worst part about being mayor
every year i got to sit through these dog and pony shows to convince me to use the redevelopment money for whatever fool thing they thought of
and come election time you will be called the fool who did it
so do not do a fool thing Lavon
you know what you should do
you should use that money to widen the road come off of Highway 98
the road
yeah that is a good suggestion
i will think about that
no no wait wait i am i am serious about this
' cause every time i go to Mobile for work
i get stuck behind a huge tractor or a herd of cows or something
it is just getting ridiculous
if you widen that road then
Hey Zoe
Hey
if you widen that road then maybe buses'd actually come in the center of town instead of dropping people off at the spur
yeah if you fix that road maybe ambulances could actually get here in an emergency
See that
that is life or death
Thank you Zoe
uh huh
that is a great point
See what better way to spend the money
this is the perfect use of the money
and the model looks both beautiful and delicious
Mmm
when the Memory Matrons finally recognize you all this time and hard work is gonna pay off
all right look i will tell you what we will shoot for it
half court
Best of five
if i win we use the money to fix the road
okay
Let's see what you got Tucker
oh Lord
Democracy at work really makes you proud
oh morning
i made coffee but we are out of cream
but in a shocking twist nothing on the schedule this morning so i figure i will step on out and get some now that you are here
Maybe get some breakfast too seeing as we are free free free
oh Mayfairs' test results came back
you are kidding
so it was not a mix up at the lab
i can not believe it
the Mayfairs
Addie it is an unwritten rule in every E R the sweeter they seem the more depraved they are
the Mayfairs are not depraved
Well maybe not both of them
since the minister exhibited first he is probably patient zero
which means now i have to tell the perfect little minister's wife that her husband had an affair
oh hold on there
you do not know that
Well i suppose Beverly could have been the one who cheated but it is unlikely given
i mean you do not know either of them cheated
it is syphilis
this is the minister and his wife we are talking about
they are role models
you mess that up you could do a lot of damage
i am not gonna do any damage
i am just gonna give her the information plain and simple
it is okay it
it is okay
Shh
Shh
my my whole life i have only had sexual relations with one man
then i guess we both know how you must have gotten syphilis
Deep breaths
there you go deep breaths
but but Peter loves me
i i
i trust him
i know
do not blame yourself
i was not
Good good
Look i know that this is a shock but people cheat
Even the people we trust the most
oh
but hey hey what do i know
Am i married
Clearly not
so why do not we just get that penicillin shot over with okay
it is more of a butt thing
Why do not we go back to my office
my Zoe you look real pretty tonight
Thanks Tom
any wine you have not from a box please
that is funny i remember boxed wine being your Achilles heel
Slutty Achilles high heel
Just pour it
you know that guy you almost killed is fine by the way thanks for asking
Why do not you just ask me what they are talking about
because i do not care
Really
'Cause it is big news
and yet i do not care
i mean if BlueBell had a gossip rag this'd be the cover story
which i would not read
Well
okay
what is going on
the minister and his wife split up
Apparently somebody planted a bug in her ear that the minister cheated
my goodness
who would say a cruel thing like that
Sad
i will take the whole bottle to go
there is a terrible rumor going around town
it is about the Mayfairs
Ah right
i may have heard something about that
Obviously it is just some huge misunderstanding
oh i am pretty sure it is not
what did you do
me
yeah
i just did my job
i certainly did not split them up
Whatever happened with the Mayfairs is not my fault
okay so you are not involved in propagating rumors that the minister was unfaithful
i did not propagate any rumors exactly
Look even if i did know something i could not talk about it because of doctor patient confidentiality
but come on you can not act that surprised
a minister having an affair
that is so cliche
oh enough with the New York thing
Lavon Hayes does not do cynicism
and neither does BlueBell
we believe in the Mayfairs Zoe
Lavon 50 of marriages end in divorce
you know life goes on
People survive
i am sure this town has something better to talk about
it makes you wonder how long it is been going on
Mm hmm
and with whom
and when in the world did Peter find the time
i mean those two are always together
oh there is always time for a quickie if one is highly motivated
can i help you Sugar
yeah i think Addy called
i am the new doctor in town
Zoe Hart
first exam is free
Right
what can i do for you hon
Looks like you need a trim
some highlights for sure
i have been going to Sally Hershberger since i was seven
she just gets crazy jealous
i do not want to put you at any risk
Mm hmm
Maybe just a blow out
Sure thing
have a seat
oh
my
Delia Ann
you are here early
i was not expecting you till this afternoon
may i get you some sweet tea
oh no need
i was just admiring your beautiful diorama
oh thank you so much
i have worked so very hard on it
and the presentation for the mayor is ready too
oh is that so
what on earth for
Excuse me
do you take me for a fool
i i
i do not understand
i know all about it Lemon
how you let George circumvent the system
Just to widen a road
is there anything even remotely historical about a road
i
i have no idea what you are talking about
oh really
so you do not know that George has been playing back door politics with the mayor and the redevelopment money has already been committed to a road project
Honestly Lemon bless your heart but if you can not control your own fianc how in the world can you expect to command an important organization like the Memory Matrons
but uh
you know my bedroom window overlooks the rectory
and for 15 years not a peep
and then suddenly all hell is breaking loose
Mm
Sorry i am late
no prob sweetie
i thought it must be someone else but no
it was Peter and Beverly
now i could not make out the words exactly but they definitely were angry
i am not so sure it was not Beverly's fault that they split up
she is been acting real different lately
Wearing lipstick
she had me do her toes a few weeks back purple
oh
Well it could be
Peter tried to put his foot down
Want his old Beverly back
no it is my fault
i am the reason the Mayfairs broke up
it was me
Come on Lavon
Clearly that shampoo girl slept with Reverend Mayfair
you know how much more proof do you need
Did she say she slept with him
no
but i have Addy out looking for her so i will be able to confirm it soon enough
Why you doing this
Why do you have to believe the worst in people
People cheat Lavon
Lots of people
yeah the Mayfairs ain't like that
they are honest decent people
they love each other they have faith in each other and i have faith in them
Fine
have faith
i have science and i am sure i am right
you sure
yeah
Science tells me that i am 99 sure that Reverend Mayfair cheated
so you admit there is a one percent chance that he did not
you know what
no i do not
because people cheat
People that you love and trust
Just like my mother did to my father
there is no one percent
that is just the statistical margin of error
Wow
this looks uh
what is it
Herbed goat cheese crostini
Shrimp stuffed zucchini balls
Tapas George your new favorite food
oh okay
Well that is so so nice of you
that is uh
Thank you
so glad you like them
is something the matter
oh
nothing at all
i mean you did go behind my back and get the mayor to use my redevelopment money for a new road project but it is no big deal
it is trivial tiny just like your tapas
Wait since when have you been interested in the redevelopment funds
i have been talking about the covered bridge project for the past three months
oh
Sweetie you just you have so many projects you know
sometimes it is just you know in one ear
there is a diorama in the living room
i am so so sorry
it was really just a spur of the moment thing
i mean i just happened to mention the road and then Lavon he thought it was a great idea
i apologize
i should have remembered
okay
now you can go back and get my money from the mayor
yeah i am not gonna go do that
Excuse me
i mean sure honey
i mean the covered bridge is beautiful but it doesn't serve any actual function
it functions as a reminder
of the past yeah
but BlueBe can not keep dwelling on the past Lemon
we got to look to the future too you know
we go and upgrade that road into town it is gonna increase tourism it is gonna improve our quality of life
i mean Zoe Hart even thinks that we can go ahead and save some lives you know
it can cut down on ambulance response times
oh is that what Zoe Hart thinks
Well if Zoe thinks that we need a new road then i guess the discussion is over
Come on Lemon
Good night George
Wait i thought i was staying over
oh is that what you thought
or is that what Zoe Hart thought
Think again George Tucker
Pretty lady
this is good bye
you have got to be kidding me
Earl
Why the long face Mr Mayor
Just got off the phone with my agent
you know i thought since the jock itch people wanted me there might be other endorsement oportunities
Turns out i was wrong
Well on the bright side at least people with itchy junks still love you
i heard about your new road
okay
yeah it is gonna be awesome
is it
the Memory Matrons have a meeting set with you next week to peach restoring the bridge at Fall's Creek
no offense but that is another reason
i am glad i chose a road
the ramifications
Lemon and the rest of the society worked day and night on that presentation
there was a candy diorama just for you
and now she is in trouble with Delia Ann
i am telling you if Lemon gets kicked out of the Memory Matrons it will be all your fault
i did not realize
i i am sorry
Tell Lemon
Hey uh Crazy Earl's on the roof of the hardware store
he said he is gonna jump
it is okay Earl just take it easy
do not do anything rash
i am gonna jump
is not anybody gonna do anything
do not you have a wacky volunteer fire department or something
Well they do not like to be called on their poker night so
i am jumping
Tell my family good bye
Somebody should go up there
is not there a social worker or suicide hotline
oh honey that is just Crazy Earl
you people think i am cynical
Hey you want a pretzel
i steal them from work and keep them in case i go somewhere there is nothing to eat
what
Good
i am jumping
Whoo hoo
Go Wade
okay time to come down
no
i am not moving
Come on Earl
you are not gonna jump
here i go
no
Damn it Earl come with me
Stop this
i won't
i am not gonna do it
now come on
Look at the doc down there
she is about to pee her pants
Come with me before you hurt yourself
Only if you do it
no
Well
Say good bye everyone  Moon River   Wider than a mile   i am crossing you   in style   Someday   oh dream maker   you heartbreaker   Wherever you are going   i am going your way   two drifters   off to see the world   there is such a lot of world to see 
i am done  we are after the same   Rainbow's end   Waitin' round the bend   my huckleberry friend   Moon River and me 
okay okay
Hey Dad
it is time to go home
Let's go
Dad
every month Earl cashes the government check and then heads straight for the liquor store
then he gets drunk and he climbs up on that roof
and every month his son comes and sings him down
Wow
i had no idea
you know what
yeah maybe 99 out of 100 people will disappoint you
i do not know
i think you find the magic of the world in the margin of error
i have been calling
Started to get scared you dropped your phone in the toilet
Again
Come on Lemon you want to tell me what is going on
i mean'cause i know that you can not really be jealous of Zoe Hart
i am not jealous of Zoe Hart
she has no manners dubious breeding and hair like a grill brush
she and i are not even in the same universe
okay then you want to tell me why you have been acting like a crazy person ever since she came to town
it is what she represents George
Ever since she got here you are the one that is changed
from your new friends in Mobile to the tapas and the road
and do you even realize that the last three DVDs that you bought for movie night were Woody Allen
Martin Scorsese and Nora Ephron
you love Nora Ephron
all right you know that is besides the point
it is like Zoe Hart has flipped some New York switch in you and you are just not the same person anymore
you know what
that is ridiculous
i
all right fine
i miss New York sometimes
i lived there for two years
i am not gonna just sit here and pretend it did not happen
i do not want you to pretend George
i want you to want to be here
not wondering what sort of cosmopolitan thing is around the corner or trying to make BlueBell into something that it is not
i like the way that things are here
i like that we are off the beaten path
i like that there is no rush hour and there are only four people that work in the police department because nothing bad ever happens here
it is enough for me
Lemon
Hey look BlueBell is my home
i chose to come back here
and once you chose to leave
and how do i know that someday you won't miss it and take that fancy new road of yours right back out of town
Lemon
Found the shampoo girl
she is in the waiting room
i hope you know what you are doing
the whole town's up in arms about the Mayfairs
Pancake breakfast is tomorrow
if people do not turn up that is an entire tradition you will have broken
Just send her in
hi
Please have a seat
Listen i am sorry for dragging you in like this but we have a medical situation on our hands
and i am just wondering if you have been experiencing any random symptoms fever sore throat rashes sores
Wow you are a really good doctor
How'd you know that
Just a hunch
Why do not you tell me what is been going on
Well a couple weeks ago i got this sore on my hand and now there is this rash on my feet
and i have got a canker in my mouth that won't go away
Let me take a look
Ahhh
a ah
Wanda
Hmm
there is a good chance that you have syphilis
Syphilis
is not is not that a
yeah
that is why i need to ask you who you have slept with other than Reverend Mayfair
what
Gross
i never slept with Reverend Mayfair
so it is the minister's wife you have been having the affair with
Ew
what are you talking about
Look i i won't tell anyone but this is serious
i need you to tell me the truth
i am
the truth is i only have sex with my boyfriend Chase Cobb
been dating since we were 14
but he is in the Navy now and i only see him maybe twice a year
then what did you mean in the beauty shop when you said that you had broken up the Mayfairs
i do not want to get anyone in trouble
Wanda it is important
i promised
i pierced Mrs Mayfair's belly button
i know i am not licensed or anything but i just do it sometimes on the side to make money
and i gave one to Mrs Mayfair's niece and then Mrs Mayfair wanted one but she is a preacher's wife
oh i should've known better
i guess Reverend Mayfair took one look at it and threw her out
oh i am going to hell are not i
Addy i need a blood test
then i am going to need you to track down a sailor named Chase Cobb
' cause he is in big trouble
where you going
i have to find the Mayfairs
it turns out there is a one percent
it would be nearly impossible for anyone to deduce that the girl who gave you the belly button piercing would have had a syphilis outbreak on her hand when she did it
Again i am so so sorry
i am the one who should be apologizing
i guess i just wanted a moment to try and break free of being the minister's wife
i wanted to try and be reckless for a moment
Look where it got me
no it is me
you see i should have seen how stifled you were
Mm not stifled but it is such a big constant responsibility being someone the whole town takes their every cue off of
i know
Right
Sorry
it is just you two are the real deal
Sweet loving
i have never met people like you before
and clearly we can do better
we will do better
and the important thing is we are back together and working things out
Mm
and just in time for the pancake breakfast
um yeah
about that i do not think anyone's coming
the gossip and all
that was my fault too
Brick leaves for a week i break the town
do not be silly Zoe
Sure w we all have our doubts from time to time
but there is one thing we will always believe in
BlueBell
Hmm
Hey
Coffee
and on a Sunday
Maybe this town is not as backwards as you thought
i saw what you did for your dad
i thought it was kind of heroic
when your dad's the town drunk you get used to climbing roofs
that is all
Doesn't mean anything
Look i am heading back to the plantation
Want a ride
Actually
i think
i am going to hang out a little while longer
you were right
New York changed me
i learned to like the subway and I'd have a good slice of pizza at 2 00 in the morning
but at the end of the day none of those things matter
the things that matter they haven't changed one bit
i love you Lemon
i love you and i love BlueBell
and i will tell you what
they could put an interstate through the middle of this town and i promise you I'd still never want to leave
what is this
i think it is time we started looking for a house do not you
Come on
oh Delia Ann
Delia Ann
can i have a word please
oh certainly Mr Mayor
Good
i just wanted to tell you that Lemon Breeland's covered bridge presentation oh was very impressive
Really
yeah
you saw it
the candy and everything
of course i did
the candy diorama
Delicious
you actually ate that thing
Well i just wanted to let you know that uh because of Lemon's outstanding work
i moved some things around in the budget and was able to find some extra funds to put towards the covered bridge
i do not know what to say
Thank you
oh you are welcome
Thank you so much Mr Mayor
how on earth did you find the extra money
uh well let's just say uh it was not easy
Ah i am Lavon Hayes and i am itch free where it counts
Hey
Wait up
you you coming to church
a first time for everything
okay
i thought that i could check out what this whole one percent thing is about
you think it matters that i am half Jewish
oh are you kidding
the Reverend Mayfair is a huge fan of the Old Testament
but half Jewish doesn't mean you do not have to stay for the whole thing
the reason that door is so loud so you can not sneak out halfway through
that is brilliant
the man knows what he is doing
Guess so
Guess so
Fine
the man knows what he is doing
and Amen
Sync by Flp corrected by susanaLC www addic7ed comListen my love
i just want to say how beautiful you are
how magnificent the only thing that ever tempted me to believe in God
how much i envy you too
i envy you all that awaits you my baby
all the magic the campfires the starry skies french fries they are so great when you are a kid the last day of school when the bell rings and summer's yours
Your first french kiss
Damn
the smells autumn miniskirts
all the magic
Grab it my love
Grab it and keep it
Cherish it
Life is a mystery my baby
but grownups often forget that

Always be proud

Play never stop playing
and love
Above all above all love
you are my love
i love you
Beyond words
that was nice that was very nice
you really got into it especially the part
the magic the french fries the bit about school
that was nice you really felt it
but in a few places you seemed to smile a little
i am not so sure
no
he is talking to his son for the last time
i know it is the last time he talks to his son
my smile was not
i mean he is trying to smile so he doesn't cry
he doesn't want to traumatize his son
i get it
he might cry
so you opted not to show any emotion to remain a bit more
i showed emotion
See at that point in the film
i need Christian to be a wreck
he is completely undone
Sure i agree but it seemed to me i was a wreck
yeah
Sure
no
no
we have to sense that the man's nearly dead
he is talking but there is no
so
i do not know how exactly to express the idea
how can i put it
i think we need tears here
yeah we need tears
you want him to cry
yeah i think so
the whole time
not necessarily all the time
at the end
Look i do not know
where you want
i want to see the emotion
you want him to cry
yes
yes that would be good
Shit

a finger
i am sorry
we got home late and Marco was supposed to toss it

Stop it

i promised never to ask you to change

Just as i hit the corner the bus left
Driver would not stop
the SOB saw me too
he looked me in the eyes
he saw me but would not stop his crappy bus
how can he do that
Really
what is he thinking
God i am a good person
now i feel good
i am gonna have a great day
there are better ways to feel good than to look someone in the eye and say i know you ran
but i am not gonna stop cause that is who i am
it is what dreamed of as a kid
i am pregnant
Ever notice that when you say a word over and over the word loses its meaning
Your brain hears it so often you can not recognize it
Like when you go in a place that reeks of piss
you go in gross the stench is overwhelming
after 20 minutes you do not smell it
you know it must you take a whiff but you do not smell the piss
Why
Cause your brain's grown used to it and doesn't register piss anymore
Like a chick's perfume
at first it makes you tingle
she walks in and you smell it you know she is there
or when you are balling you are totally in it
but after a while say 2 or 3 years with the same girl you do not smell it
Even if she changes her perfume
what is eating you today
this morning i found a fingertip in my toilet bowl
there was a fingertip in my toilet cause Louis cut off the finger of some guy i do not know
and i just found out i am pregnant
Your menus

two glasses of wine
Poor honeybun

it will be ok hon
i do not know what to do

Tired of what
the job we do collecting

you taste the fries but it is less pure less intense
Get the sauce on the side
first very few places will do that
Plus it has to sink in
the fries need to steep in the cheese and sauce
you know your problem
a midlife crisis
that is why you are all mixed up
that will be 12 48 please
Louis is like a hero to me
his life was not easy
when we are together it is like i was 6 years old

Think it is worse to cheat on your girlfriend with a normal girl or a hooker

Coming in for a beer

See you
Bye
Stop it
Stop it right there
Stop looking at me
Look at yourself
you waltz in everyone eats out of your hand
you are all smug

Haven't you realized sometimes you can not come back
you can not always repair things this is not a film

Dark

i love you Louis
i love you too
i am sorry for this morning
i am going to lie down
hello
I'd like to speak to Philipe Chevalier
hi you must be Louis
i am Philipe
i know
i mean i knew that
Come in

no maybe some water
Ok perfect
have a seat i will be a sec
here you go
Thanks
you are a great actor
Thanks
Really Mr Chevalier a great actor
Philipe will do fine
have a seat
so you do not have much experience
that is right not much at all
but you have some
a little sort of
what kind
Well you know Mr Chevalier it may sound silly but I'd prefer not to talk about it just yet
no
Ok i won't insist
you know Gisle
i do not want to be rude but can i say my text
if i do not do it now i never will
i will just run for it
Sure go ahead
Good idea
it will break the ice
one thing
do not try to perform
Say it mechanically
i mean give the worst reading you can
i will do my best
you are my love my little boy
you can not answer my love
Daddy's in the TV
i do not know how
Shit
by now you know i have gone but you do not know why
what are you clapping for
Did i just sing a fucking song
Sorry Serge
i am really sorry
they are regulars they won't mind
a little action will help them digest their pasta
i do not know i must've blown a fuse
i spent my life blowing fuses and any man who'd let me
now i want you to take a little walk
i am ok i will finish my shift
Forget your shift
the noon rush is over i do not need you
you will break all my dishes
Thanks you are sweet
do not tell anyone
Go on fly
Get your hair streaked anything
and if you ever want to talk
i am sorry
it was awful
no it was not awful
you just said the words
like i asked
it came out all wrong
i am wasting your time
Louis it was perfect
first of all i am just giving my own opinion here
i am not a guru
i do not own the truth
to begin with now that you know your text try to forget it
you want me to forget it
Exactly
you must forget your text forget you know what you are going to say
Even forget that this is an audition a film
but you can not forget one thing
a little boy about two years old
you have to picture him in your mind
he has to exist
there is only you and him in the scene
you have to be in a place where there is just you and him
that is where it all begins
what does your character want
i dunno
he wants to say goodbye to his kid
i do not agree
i think that for some reason you have to say goodbye but you do not want to
what you'd really like is to stay with him all your life
what you want is your son and the only way you can stay with him is via a camera
do you have kids
no
do you want them
i dunno i guess so
Start at the beginning
we will do the first 5 or 6 lines
but this time say them very slowly
Too slowly
Take your time
and do not forget
you are in the woods all alone
there is just you and the video camera
it is your child your baby who you held in your arms who you watched sleeping who smelled so wonderful
God you scared me
what
you scared me
what
what are you doing
i got up to pee
i am sorry
do not ever do that
you will give me a heart attack
i am sorry i just wanted to pee
it is not funny
i know
Stop laughing it is not funny
do not get up to pee at night
i promise i promise
i will never pee at night again
i envy you all that awaits you my baby
all the magic the campfires starry skies french fries
Fries are so yummy when you are a kid
Fries are so yummy
Fries are so yummy when you are a kid
can you believe it
the guy invites me on his goddamn boat
we spend the night drinking whisky and talking
on a goddamn boat
in the middle of the night
so we become friends and we start talking about important stuff
Stuff that is important to me anyway
Like some things in life matter
what can i say
i had an amazing night
Shit a really special time
it was really like a i dunno
a communion
Right that is the word
a communion
a communion on his goddamn boat
Like that out of the blue
so then he asks me to be his blood brother
Gentlemen
two red ales please
yeah he wants us to be blood brothers
so me i dunno
i know what you are thinking
but it was not that
it was not some fag thing
it was not a fag thing
it was not faggy
so we cut our hands and everything the whole nine yards blood brothers the whole thing
Time passes it is been two weeks
last night i am here gabbing with a coupla guys sipping a brewski just shooting the shit
Turns out this fucker's blood brothers with 3 or 4 guys
Even with that slob Tanguay
i mean what the fuck
you feel cheap
Real cheap
i mean i cut my hand
i do not cut it for fun
it means something
but for some people nothing's sacred
they swear oaths up and down and it doesn't mean a damn thing
Guys like that are fucking disgusting
you know
Esteem must be deserved
he who esteems everything is badly served
Molire
where
is it normal we always talk English with her
we are in Qubec
it is her dime
so what
when i go to Italy i pay and i speak Italian
you can not speak Italian and never went to Italy
if i went I'd try to speak Italian
it is only normal
we are in Canada
no i am in Qubec
Same difference
i hate vodka
we case the park tomorrow
i can not i am busy
what
Why where you going
Marco i am busy
be proud
Always be proud
do not let others step on you
never stop playing
and love my baby
Above all above all
Love
Your instinct is good
i can already see that
you won't tell me your experience but it is there
i think you are forcing it
yeah i am forcing it
i think so yeah
what do you mean forcing it
you are chasing the emotion forcing it
Even in the part about the campfires
you held your eyes wide open to bring on tears
that is ok it is an old trick
it is useful but you do not need it
sometimes i am afraid i won't have any
what emotions
yeah
do not worry you have them
you have to get out of their way turn off your mind
Just pretend that emotions are like a small wild animal
if you chase it it is going to run away
Ideally you sit down
you do nothing
you let it come to you
Even when it is right next to you you do not budge
you let it do what it has to
if you can do that you are acting
you are having wings
you are in the zone
Kids do that
it is the first thing they do
they play doctor make up stories
and they believe
and you have to believe too
God
you have a girlfriend
yeah i do
what is her name
Suzanne
Well Suzie
Known her long
i dunno 2 years
2 years
Lucky
i have never lasted longer than 2 months
here

do not feel obliged
Louis i am happy to invite you
what is the play
it is called Dissentiment

in theater you do not always understand
Christ

Quietly ok

i can still understand it
what did he say
i should try harder to like it

Stop it
you saw a good show
i am so sorry
C'mon let's get to work
Let's do it again
Remember get into the scene
all he has left all he can leave behind is a little message on a videotape
Take your time
not during the scene but before

do not try to be anything
Just try to be him
to see what he sees
to think what he thinks
his little boy
See his boy

I'd prefer if he'd been some dickhead
i am alive and i have a little baby in my tummy
sometimes i feel like
i feel so tiny
it is like life is tossing me around

Life is a mystery

never stop playing
and above all above all love my baby
i love you beyond all words
Tell me about your experience Louis
when i was a kid
i was wild about movies
Mom and i went all the time
she loved movies
she was crazy about Gregory Peck
she had taste
that is it i was wild about movies and actors
I'd act out scenes at home alone
Scenes from films and plays
i knew every line in the Godfather
but only when i was alone
so that is it
i never tried to become an actor
the part of town i am from things can get rough and i am good at getting rough
i became a runner
i beat up people who owe money and won't pay
a collector that is me
or that was me
i never stopped acting out scenes alone at home
and nobody in your life knows
Well there is you
Gisle my cousin from the agency
Your girlfriend
Why not
who knows
i was afraid she'd laugh at me
so all your life you beat people up
Glad we did not meet before
Look Louis
i do not know much about life
but i know actors
and you are one
if you are half this good at the audition
i guarantee she will let you meet the director
what time tomorrow
at 11
i will think of you
Break a leg
Thanks

Let it come
Just get out of its way
Behold the man

Loads of work
Feeling alright

Dad's in the machine the TV

Want us to be a family
i saw his last show
God it was boring
Philipe Chevalier
he can not act
he never could and he never will
some people like him
some people like McDonald's doesn't mean it is good
he is a ham
he is stale
he is never believable
and he is always playing the same part badly
so why are you here
Morbid curiosity
Watch out
what for
my foot
you just stepped on my foot
oh that
no i can not watch out for that
do you mind
we are all pimping for somebody Billie
Mostly for ourselves
Bastard
Scumbag
Quitter
we sell our ass to convince ourselves it is still ours
to convince ourselves it is worth more than other people's
we sit there numb on our ass no soul nothing left to defend
then we start getting bored
do you remember
as kids we never were
our ass was ours alone
we owned ourselves
we could be who we wanted
we could do it
we had favorite colors
you say I'd never have killed the cat as a kid
but i would have because i had no choice
that is enough
the only difference is back then i would've buried it
I'd have said a prayer
and I'd have wept for a week
but now i did not think twice
i could not care less about cats now Billie
but i do care about you Billie
i care about you Billie
you are the only part i have kept of myself
Even now i am dying and all i can think about is how good you smell
you smell so good
Like a young girl
you are the best
Thank you
Did you like it
it was awesome
i haven't danced like that in ages
i gotta pee

You'd have liked him

CNST MontrealMake no mistake Mr Sherman
i believe wholeheartedly in the death penalty
which is good considering your job
yes Mr Knox i am a warden and i bear the burden of execution with a clear conscience and a heavy heart
Usually
Usually
do you recall the case of Eddie Ross a Miami cop who was convicted 20 years ago for murdering his partner over the love of a woman
Ross was sentenced to death based on a theory that Ross lured his partner Glen Hogan to an isolated location where a vicious argument ensued
Infuriated by jealousy Ross pulled his revolver and shot Glen Hogan point blank in the throat
as Hogan lay dying Ross covered himself with Hogan's blood to make it appear he'd rendered aid
i was a young lawyer then
i remember the Ross case
Ross is scheduled to be executed tomorrow at midnight
i believe him to be innocent
Why you ask
Jesus has told me this man is innocent
after a long night in my own personal garden of Gethsemane
i prevailed upon the governor to stay Ross's execution
he declined though he did tell me that Mr Sherman here can find anything
here is an affidavit in which the condemned
Mr Edward Ross engages you as his lawyer
there is a dress code on death row i am afraid
Guy's kind of weird
i did not kill Glen Hogan
you are completely innocent
the eighties were a different time
the line between right and wrong were real blurry back then
but i am not guilty of killing Glen Hogan
you assaulted him
i beat the crap out of him
he slept with my girlfriend
Miss Gloria Penalt
who has since gone missing
is that what you want me to find
is she a witness
Gloria did not witness anything
me and Glen were alone out in the middle of nowhere
Why
i asked him out there to apologize to him
Nobody's going to believe that
if i had been your lawyer i would've advised you that such a statement would antagonize the jury
i found out that Gloria was getting a piece of almost every other guy in vice
not just Hogan
we met
Talked and buried the hatchet
and then a shot rang out
that is right
i was walking away i heard the shot turned around and saw Glen laying on the ground bleeding from the neck
the bullet went through and through
i saw the shooter fired at him but he got away
i called for help
i tried to stop Glen's bleeding
which conveniently explains why you failed the paraffin test and had blood all over your hands
what do you want me to find
all right
there are 2 bullets out there
one of them went through Glen's neck and ended up God knows where
the other one
i fired at the shooter
Ended up another God knows where
you find the one that killed Hogan
Maybe the governor's got reason to stay my execution
after 20 years
Like looking for a needle in a haystack
i do not like it
Like 2 needles in a haystack
twice as easy
i want to do it
Well the warden thinks he is innocent
the governor's looking for a reason to stay his execution
Sighs
Listen when Walter looks for something he finds the truth in everything around it
are you sure you want everything stirred up when maybe you should be making peace with yourself
are you kidding
the truth will save my life
he could be telling a lie
last ditch effort to dodge the electric chair
you end up looking for something that is not there
i am gonna risk it
Sighs
if you lied to us i will bring you back to life so they can electrocute you again
hi
i am not stealing i am just making change
Apparently this place runs on the honor system
at least that is what they told me
who are you
who are you
Why are you asking
Why are you asking
i am Leo Knox
this is my place
oh
OK you must be Walter Sherman then
and who are you
i am Dr Lance Sweets
i am a psychologist with the FBl
i am actually um
i am here to
OK you actually do that
Wow
Clears throat
what can we do for you Dr Sweets
i am uh
i am here to evaluate
Mr Sherman's competency as a consultant to all federal agencies
Find out if i am crazy you mean
in laymen's terms yeah
Sync and correction by Mlmlte www addic7ed com
i am wildly impressed
Chuckles
i am Kevin
Willa
you are that chick who works at the bar in looking glass key right
End of the world
Ends of the Earth
and no i can not let you drink there underage
Well i do not need your help to drink underage
Why else would you need me
Maybe what i need is an excuse to start up a conversation
Mission accomplished
you play volley ball Willa
oh God
and things were going so well between us
there is a volley ball game tomorrow if you want to come
i got to warn you Kev i am a bad girl on probation
and things were going so well between us
Chuckles
See you tomorrow
you mean you are the one who gets to decide if Walter gets to consult with the police
i told you
Well the federal government requires that Mr Sherman fill out this mental status exam questionnaire
if Walter passes you could work together officially
and Walter could get paid
so the first thing Walter has to do to prove that he is not crazy is find evidence that 200 cops and friends of Tex were unable to find 20 years ago
a lot of boast but that is the essence of what i do
but if Mr Sherman fails all federal officials will be prohibited from consulting with him
what
Why
because having an insane man in the chain of evidence is a guaranteed prosecution fail
Chuckles
Attention boring old people
i got invited to a beach party
can i go
anyone i know
um the Montgomerys at Ferrell point
Rich folks
yeah their son Kevin asked me
i told him the truth that i am on probation
oh
i bet that got him excited
Found himself a bad girl
do not make it like that
he was cool
was he cool or was he a target
Walter did not we agree to give Willa the benefit of the doubt
should not you take advantage of the fact that you have a shrink in the house
he could tell us if Willa's a sociopath
i am sorry
can i ask who is this
Willa lives and works here while she is on probation
do we need to have a talk about boys and beach parties
Ew
it is not like you
you know you are
it is not like
you have been around
Thanks Mom
Thanks Dad
Thanks Creepy Older Brother
Thanks Eavesdropping Shrink but i have got the sex stuff covered so
she is being sarcastic in metaphor
Willa is probably a virgin and will remain one until she is married off to a nice gypsy boy
Right
Again ew
what
is not this some kind of psycho sexual abuse
i just want to get this questionnaire filled out so i can go home to Washington
when can we start
is this really the only way we can do this
when Walter's on the hunt it is difficult to get him to sit still
would you describe him as manic
no i would not
Motivated focused avid
huh
Excellent use of synonyms Leo
where is our first stop
Ross's arresting officer
a retired Detective named Coleman
Isabel's great Uncle Sal says he hangs out in a club in Coral Gables
would you say you are cheerful or sad most days
yeah I'd say i am cheerful and sad most days
he means predominantly
Cheerful right Leo
do you sleep well
yes and often
do you have an active sex life
um every once in a while i like to change it up and get a little passive
you know take in the moment
does your mind play tricks on you
my lawyer says no
Mr Knox i really need Mr
Sherman to answer in his own words
you can call me Walter
i am good with Mr Knox
have you ever contemplated suicide
during the darkest days after the loss of my wife and child yes i did
i meant Mr Sherman
Ah hell i can think of at least 10 people
I'd kill before i killed myself
you can write that down as a no
Dance music playing
so you are the one who arrested Ross
Back in the eighties i was working internal affairs
Why would an internal affairs investigator be assigned to homicide
when a cop kills another cop it falls to internal affairs
i make no apologies
Obviously you think Ross did it
Look he was killed by a 38
Ross's police issued 38 was fired that night
Airtight case
Except the bullet was never found
Paraffin test showed Ross had gunpowder on his hand
my dad used to watch this show
what show
Seriously
Look at the guys at the bar
where do you think the TV guys came up with the idea
Ross Fontana
those boys are the originals
Back in the day working vice with Ross and Hogan
Retired bought this club
would you mind showing me the crime scene
Chuckles
what you do not believe in GPS
GPS is just another way for the government to keep an eye on me
you do not got to write that down
Why are you offering to help us out at all Detective Pullman
Ross filed what 7 different appeals
he lost every one
so you guys worked with Hogan and Ross back in the eighties
we were tight
Man it was like the wild wild west
you got to know who your friends were
and is it also true that you all took turns with Gloria Penalt
Hey like i said
it was a different time baby
yeah a fun time baby
yeah we all want to thank you for the aids and herpes epidemic
and the t shirt and sports jacket look
what is wrong with that
i just want to know if you have any doubts about Ross's guilt
None
None
that is a good look
T shirt light blazer
Geographically appropriate
not at all
Why do not you have your pet Feeb here request Hogan's murder book
Excuse me
i am not an FBI agent
i am a psychologist actually
we do not give a rat's ass
Baby we do not give a rat's anything
i just have one more question
how is a couple of old cops
like you afford to buy a place like this
and what is it got to do with that old internal affairs guy drinking for free
Up here a quarter mile
Walter these 2 bullets were discharged in a swamp 2 decades ago
uh huh
so how are you going to find them
oh no problem
i have a metal detector
i know it is hard to understand Dr Sweets but this is what Walter does
all i have to do is follow the bullet trajectories through the swamp
uh oh
oh do not worry
i just wish that i had brought my hip waders
no that is not the problem
if you are irritated by every rub how will your mirror be polished
i guess you won't be needing the hip waders huh
Say edible oil air socks and cheese bucket
what
do you ever talk to inanimate objects
yes
they hardly ever answer
Rude
how far was Hogan standing from his parked car when he got shot
According to the murder book Hogan's body was found 20 feet west
where was Ross
Ross testified that he was beside his truck 10 years distant from Hogan when he heard the shot
is your little diorama there to scale
in my head it is
how is that possible
Ah it is a knack i picked up after i got blown up in Iraq
do you enjoy setting fire to things
yes
Candles bonfires barbecues lanterns and cats
Sighs
what is that
Buildings from the storage facility
a 38 caliber bullet would've passed through Hogan's neck up over his car and between these buildings
Dr Sweets
Pull this string
Ross testified that the bullet came from off to his left
now we know the trajectory of the bullet
Clears throat
i wonder how far a 38 caliber bullet would travel
Passing through a human neck at flat trajectory between 200 and 600 meters
Say a quarter mile
how could you possibly know that
i work with a bunch of scientists and a former sniper
and i pay attention
huh
will your metal detector be able to find a 20 year old 38 caliber bullet through 6 inches of asphalt
Nah
that is why i need you to requisition some ground penetrating radar
so Sweets was right
the storage lockers are that way a quarter mile past those palm trees
Hey hey look who is here
how is everything going so far
Isabel meet Detective Henry Coleman
the man who put Eddie Ross on death row
but other than that he is been very nice
not nice enough to let you know the whole crime scene got paved over
i am deputy U S Marshall Isabel Zambada
oh a fed
i hate feds
you are kind of out of your jurisdiction here are not ya girly
that is all right old man
i am not nuts about internal affairs
Why you got something to hide
you know Bronski and Fontana you hurt their feelings when you asked about the club
oh you mean when i implied they were on a take
Walter
no that is all right
they were on the take
it was a different time
i do not want you to get confused
you now they did a lot more good than bad
and that is the real test is not it
Hank did you enjoy having carnal relations with Gloria Penalt
if that means what i think it means
i enjoyed them immensely
but i did not fall in love with her
Only Ross made that mistake
I'd like to talk to her
Gloria disappeared within days of Hogan's murder
Dropped off the face of the earth
but if you find old Gloria say hi from Hank
do you have anything i could use
a picture
anything at all
Gloria gave me this
Asked me what i thought
Gloria  in the summer rain what i thought was she had real talent  if i was listening 
Overlapping music playing
this does not look good
Walter does everything for a reason
yeah that is fine
Unless the reason is he is crazy
Overlapping music playing
 i lay awake and count the world trouble 
that is her
OK that ability to isolate gate and define an aural signature is extremely impressive
everything for a reason
Gloria made herself a new life
and got a new name
but it is the same voice  Just because i am in misery  i do not beg no no sympathy  that if it is not asking too much   please send someone to me  oh yes  yes please send me someone to love   oh yes applause
Thank you
Thank you so much
i think this calls for a delicate approach
do you strike yourself when you get nervous
i do not get nervous
do you suffer any memory loss
i can not remember
have you ever tried to kill flies with a rubber band
Tried no
Succeeded yeah
Gentlemen Chantey Dubois
Thank you uh
i used to be Gloria Penalt and i went through a lot of trouble to change my name my whole life
we understand Miss Dubois
everyone assumes that Eddie Ross killed Glen Hogan because of you
that doesn't make it your fault Miss Dubois
Observing right
Sorry
Habit
Ross says it is not true
then why did Eddie kill Glen
you think that he did
Eddie Ross was no Saint
i mean he killed 3 men in the line of duty
that doesn't make it murder
i think what Miss Dubois means is that a man who kills is by definition a killer
Sighs
if Eddie killed Glen it is not for the reasons that you think
i never slept with Glen Hogan
he boasted about it
Well it is very common for an insecure Alpha male to boast about sexual conquests
that is not it is it
if you do not mind boys this girls has got to sing for her supper
but you said that uh it is not what we think
so that means there is another reason
you also said that this girl sings for her supper
so
you know who else sings for her supper
Informants
that crazy
it is unless
it is true
you are right
i was passing information to Hogan
Hogan was investigating crooked cops
and was Eddie Ross one of the crooked cops Hogan was after
i could not tell where the line was between crooked and not crooked
Ross called it blurry
when Glen turned up dead i took off for France
i just got back 2 years ago
my specialty is i sing songs about broken hearts
that is because i love Eddie Ross
i never got over him
Excuse me gentlemen
you saw Gloria
how does she look
Well she looked and sounded great
Addendum she is still totally in love with you
never slept with Glen Hogan
she said that
she still loves me all these years later
Sequel to the addendum
Glen Hogan was an informant for internal affairs
so question
Did you have your gun out because of Gloria
or because Glen Hogan was going to rat you out to internal affairs
i never said i had my gun out
Well you lied because you thought that having your gun out looked like premeditated murder
the jury knew you were lying and sent you to the electric chair
how could you possibly know my gun was drawn
the killer shot Glen Hogan in the neck and disappeared in the woods in what 3 seconds
you are not Billy the kid
so if you were able to get off a shot you had your gun out already
Officer down
Officer down
Glen you are going to be OK you understand me
Breathing heavily
Why
me and Glen busted a coke operation
there were bags of coke everywhere
Suitcases of cash
we took 20 grand of it for ourselves
it was different
Times
yeah i know
Blurry
Internal affairs was sniffing around
i showed Glen my gun
you know just to stress that he should keep his mouth shut
but i did not shoot him
Gloria came right out and said that she still loves me
Listen to her sing
Mr Sherman if i could be with Gloria again it'd be worth being locked away all these years
i signed on to find a bullet
not your reason to live
Enjoy the CD
so what do you think would happen to you if you fail to find what you are looking for
it is never happened
what if it did
it won't
how do you know' cause i will die before i do not find something
do i really have to tell you that dying is not a healthy response to failure
i am not going to fail
I'd like to hypnotize you
if you really want me to dance around like a chicken
i will do it without being hypnotized
i am not exactly inhibited
no
Under hypnosis i might be able to discover the source of your compulsion to find
you can try but
i am pretty sure i am the kind of guy who just can not be hypnotized
is he under
yeah
he is tricky
i would not trust him
Walter your left hand is a helium balloon
Incredibly light
huh
huh
Convinced
I'd be convinced if he told you how to open his vault
all right
Walter
how do you open your vault
Well first you put your hands at 7 00 and 4 30
OK that is enough
he is he is hypnotized
all right
Walter forget the combination
i want to take you to the day that you sustained your brain damage
in Iraq
yeah
in the Humvee
are you in a Humvee
no
i am on foot
in Iraq
no
i am in Afghanistan
Wait i thought that he was blown up in Iraq
he was
Walter
i want you to leave Afghanistan and i want you to go to Iraq
Sorry
i am in Afghanistan
what are you doing in Afghanistan
Looking for a stolen Humvee
Whoosh
there it is
Gunshot
Boom
Whoosh
Walter
Walter
when i snap my fingers you can wake up
Snap
Wow
that was very helpful
you were hypnotized but you did not do what i asked you
he hijacked your hypnosis
is that possible
Let's hit the sack boys
if we do not find that bullet tomorrow a man gets fried at midnight
what just happened
Walter
all right now i am Ross
Dr Sweets you are Glen Hogan the victim
now the bullet did not come from over here
it came from there
how could Ross get that wrong
no
what he heard was the echo off of his truck
where is the bullet at Walter
no how could you know that what Ross heard was an echo
Flamenco dancers
that is what i learned when you hypnotized me
no
Theoretically you can not be both hypnotized and in control of your own hypnotic state
what can i say
i have got a unique brain
Nobody looked in this direction for the bullet
I'd like to say i could not do it without you
Dr Sweets but that is just wrong
although i admit you did make it easier
i have no idea what you are talking about
now either that beautiful girl is a practicing Hindu or she has a bullet in her forehead
it is not insanity Dr Sweets
it is a gift
Hey Willa great hands
all right
i like your bathing suit
Thanks
it is so individual
huh
Ballistics on that bullet you found in the billboard are inconclusive
was it a 38
Probably
but it was definitely not fired from Eddie Ross's service revolver
was it the bullet that killed Hogan
Look it is been 20 years
if there was ever any DNA on the bullet there is no trace on it now
does it raise enough doubt to keep Ross out of the electric chair
no
but get this
it matched a bullet found in a murdered veterinarian in fountain blue
Murdered when
Please say it is around the time Hogan was murdered
the next day
what does this have to do with Hogan's murder
how good a shot was Ross
he was a marksman
he competed for Miami dade against other police departments
Ross said he fired at the shooter right
what if he did not miss
Wait a minute
are you saying the imaginary killer ran off with a bullet in him
that would explain why nobody could find the bullet
Say you are a bad guy
you shoot at a cop
the cop shoots back
you have got a bullet inside you
you can not go to the hospital
they report that sort of stuff right
so where are you gonna go
Veterinarian
i can evaluate and help you know
i do it all the time at home
Bad guy kills the vet to wipe the trail clean
yeah OK i have got to admit it sounds very Florida
do you now feel compelled to find the second bullet
no
that is good
i feel impelled
so is that better
no no
not in the least
Hey i will catch you later
Willa
i wondered where you went
Thanks for a lovely day
is not this is Carmella's car
is it
you are stealing Carmella's car
i would never admit to that
can i come with you
You'd be an accessory
what you mean like cufflinks
Get in
i will teach you a few legal terms
could i ask what you are doing
i am cogitating upon the notion of inclusive
oh that is a coincidence' cause so am i
i am alluding to your mental state
yeah i got that
i am alluding to ballistics
i think we have been looking for the wrong gun 38 caliber revolver
Ballistics said that was inconclusive which means that there was an irregularity they could not explain
i think our shooter misled police by using ammunition designed for a different revolver
the casings for a 38 and a 357 are the same diameter
Look at that
so if you are telling me that someone can look crazy
but be totally sane i have to tell you that the opposite could also be true
Well true as that may be look in the mirror that is not what i am saying
i am saying our killer shot Hogan with a 357 loaded with 38 caliber ammo
Horns honking
you know it would be great if we did not get pulled over
i am not scared
Everybody's got to get arrested at least once right
i am on probation
Relax
you only live once right
i have never stolen a car
Boy does it feel great or what
Well you did not steal the car
i did
does that break some kind of criminal code
yes Kevin it breaks the code of the underworld to drive a car that someone else stole
i carry a 45 auto
King of the one shot stop
i favor the 9 millimeter auto
Ross carried a 38
so did Hogan
can you think of anybody that fired a 357
Clint Eastwood man
Way back in the seventies
no
Internal affairs
they carry 357s
no no he said fire not carry
yeah internal affairs
those guys barely need guns at all right
Excuse me
Mr Sherman
Hey i figured out why you take all those antacids
is that right
yep
since you take a lot of painkillers it upset your stomach
do you know why you take all those painkillers
i do
i am old got arthritis
i like that but no
it is because Ross shot you after you killed Hogan
that bullet's still inside of you
Damn
that makes sense
Internal affairs man
who watches the watchers
Sweets
 Tryin' to make some sense of it all   but i can see it makes no sense at all   is it cool to go to sleep on the floor   i do not think that i can take anymore   clowns to the left of me  jokers to the right  here i am stuck in the middle with you 
Ohh
Let me borrow your gun
Hell no man
it is against regulations to give a civilian a gun
you know that
Really
Really
Hey hey hey hey
Detective Coleman
yeah
Right now all we have is circumstantial evidence that you shot Hogan
that was enough to put Ross on death row
Well if you shoot me it is definite
do you really want to kill me that badly
you are annoying as hell
it might be worth it
do you think he is that crazy
his eerie calm implies either fatalistic acceptance of his fate or a psychotic break
Eh i am going to risk it
Sirens
here come the police
i am gonna walk away
you want to shoot me in the back go ahead
i do not think you have the stones  Jokers to the right  here i am stuck in the middle with you 
do not shoot him in the back
you shot a retired cop in the back with a gun you stole from an unconscious policeman
yes i did
you shot an unarmed man in the back as he walked away
yes
Well in the back of the ass
it was actually a pretty good shot
Did you have a reason
yeah
he kept leaning to one side like he was farting
oh
so you shot a man for passing gas
the butt cheek that he was favoring that is where the bullet was
so i shot him in the same place
OK i am trying
i am trying really hard not to find you insane but you are making it very difficult for me
the missing bullet was in the old man's rear end
i sure hope so otherwise i am going to prison
could not you find a more humane way to get the bullet out
yeah
we could get a warrant to take him into custody and then get a warrant to get an X ray and then get a warrant to remove the bullet
i just thought it was wrong to let an innocent man go to the electric chair while lawyers argued about warrants
See Walter is able to discern between right and wrong
but what if they only find your bullet in his
in there
Well then i guess i got a lot more finding to do
i am screwed
what am i going to do
my dad's going to kill me
i told you to slow down
that doesn't help now
that is the past
how is about thinking of something useful
Just quit panicking OK
you stole this car
not me
who do you think the cops are going to believe you or me
Uhh
you are on probation
Hey chicken little what we are going to do is walk away
Walk away
there is nothing to tie this to us
we will go in different directions
yeah i do not even know which
which way is home
Uhh
that way
i am outta here
Good knowing you Kev
oh well good
it is nice to see you here with both your lawyer and your shrink
can i take my client home
not my jurisdiction
2 bullets removed from Coleman's butt
the older one was fired from Ross's weapon 20 years ago
the newer bullet was fired by Walter with Bronski's gun
that is a relief
i did not want my Christmas dessert to be butterscotch pudding
both bullets the one from the billboard as well as the one from the dead veterinarian matched Coleman's 357
Why did Coleman kill the veterinarian
who cares
Obviously because the vet refused to remove Ross's bullet from his gluteus maximus
Well my work is done
Found the 2 bullets
no wait
do not you want to know why Coleman killed Hogan
Just do not care
i bet it was because they both loved Gloria
Romance gone bad
i do not give a flying fudgesicle
how could you not how could you not want to know
i mean this is a whole murder mystery
Walter doesn't care about murder mysteries
i really do not
Walter just likes to find things
does that make Walter crazy
i feel like someone is crazy in all this
i just hope it is not me
oh God
so Coleman caught Bronski and Fontana pocketing cash from drug busts
they offered him a cut to look the other day
he took it
Gloria found out about Bronski and Fontana told Hogan
Hogan went to internal affairs and told Coleman
Coleman knew that Bronski and Fontana would flip on him so he killed Hogan
huh
huh
the finding stuff is way more interesting than the murder stuff
who is making breakfast
you and me
are you seeing Kevin Montgomery today
Nope
Why what happened
Just the usual reasons
the usual boy girl reasons
so did Walter pass the insanity test
uh no
no he did not
what
what is the matter
Walter failed the crazy test
i am gonna miss helping you out Isabel
the test doesn't matter
the only thing that matters is what teen idol FBI shrink boy puts in his report
I'd like to certify Walter
i think he is an amazing talent
i am very unique
but i am leaving here with no insight into what compels Walter to find things
Tell the man Walter
i was um
i was in Iraq
in a Humvee with 7 men
West of a town called Al Mawali
i was looking for a very active insurgent bomb maker
my job was to find him
but what happened was
what happened was is that he found me first
Understand
Drove right over one of his IEDs
was the explosion what caused your brain damage
the explosion is what killed 6 good men
Ripped them apart
and i woke up 2 months later a changed man
Changed how
when i set out to find something now
Dr Sweets i either find it
or i die trying
now you know what compels me
Hey
how is it going
how is it feel to know you did exactly what Jesus wanted you to do
Dr Sweets are you staying for breakfast
uh no i am
i am going to go back to the real world
but thank you for your hospitality
 i know just because
Dr Sweets
yeah  i am in misery
can you tell me what you are going to do
i am going to sign off on Walter for a period of 6 months
Really
yeah
Ha
Clears throat
you won't regret it
if you ever need anything found
Believe me i know

Firpo
Wait till you hear what they hand Dempsey
Say look how are things down on Centre Street
you know i hear you are the guy that really runs that district attorney's office
i wish i did

Dempsey
you know i have been meaning to call you
you know anything about a West Side hoodlum called Pants Riordan
i know everything about him
yeah
Well i have got an indictment against him
i can get a conviction too for first degree robbery
but everybody's putting the pressure on me even the biggest boys in the party
Go light on him
Let him take a plea of third degree
you are not gonna do it
you do not play ball with those grafters Jim
you never have and you are not gonna start now
Listen to who is talking

i do not like white
Maybe I'd better go home and wire Coolidge to move over
you are a cinch
now look Jim you are the one guy that is on the level and everybody knows that
and that is what pays off in the end
and you are not gonna let those grafters shove you behind the eight ball
you do and i will punch you right in the nose

' Cause Dempsey knocked the other guy out
Well but the advertisements said they were gonna fight for 15 rounds
i should think we could get at least part of our money back
PEOPLE SHOUTlNG
i can think of a lot more pleasant things to do than look at numbers on a bulletin board
yeah
Well they are swell looking numbers to me
you see Jim's away out in front
Come on come on let's go
i won't be a minute honey
i wish we could have a fourth person on these bet collecting trips
someone to play rummy with me while you and Spud are gone
this is the only one on the level
but if i do not tap Manny Arnold for mine tonight i may never get it
this election must have cost him 100 grand

i am just wasting the best years of my life in a taxicab that is all
Congressman Robert Manning candidate for mayor and Albert Panker candidate for district attorney both conceded their defeat shortly after midnight tonight

PEOPLE CHEERlNG

a real reunion
Say i know Blackie
he is half an hour late now and he probably won't get here for another week
i am dead tired
i am going to catch up on my sleep
Goodbye
Good night Father
Well pardon me if i seem to intrude
Well i made it
you almost got away from me
i did eh
Just who might you be
do not be unpleasant
my taxi got in a jam
it would not move an inch
had to force my way through the crowd
it is a wonder i have any clothes left
after all this election hoopla is your fault not mine
i was not elected or was i
what is the name of the game
I'd like to play too
Just a simple little frame up
i force my way into your car and tear my clothes and scream and after all you have to protect your career so you pay
Well that is a nice little game
Driver just pull up to the curb
this is your corner
but wait a minute
Wait a minute
yes outside
Listen i am Eleanor
that is my favorite name
Outside
i know but Blackie sent me
Blackie
Well i am so sorry
Well nothing like a district attorney to keep a girl in shape
you and i must have a good wrestle someday
what about Blackie
where is he
Well you see it is like this
Blackie sent me Eleanor to meet you Jim
yeah
and to say that he was sorry and to ask you to take me Eleanor to the Cotton Club and that he Blackie would meet us Eleanor and Jim there later
Well did he say what night he'd meet us
you too
you have waited for Blackie
Say i have waited for that gypsy since he was six years old
of course you have
you know i want to get a good look at you
yeah
what is the idea
so at last i have met Blackie's little white gull
as soon as we get out of the car i will flap my wings for you
you know i have had a question on my mind ever since Blackie first mentioned you
yeah
Shoot
Why
Why what
Well why be a freak
i mean why do not you give in like the others do
Dip in the gravy as Blackie says
Well now that is a long long story
Well you might as well start now because we will probably have a long long wait for Blackie
Well i was born at home because i wanted to be near Mother at the time WOMAN SlNGlNG THE BAD IN EVERYMAN
and i am not sure maybe ideals have ceased to exist
Maybe they are outmoded like oil lamps and horse cars but they are mine and i am stuck with them
you will do all right
i hope
Well so ends the reading of this week's success story
Send 25 cents for our little booklet telling how Jim Wade does it in 10 easy lessons
shall we dance
no
Talk some more
no no more talk
Let's make noise
it is nice and warm
yes
how about a nice thick gooey oyster stew
at 5 00 in the morning
are you out of your mind
sometimes i think i am
but Blackie and anywhere from one to 20 hoodlums will be here any minute screaming for it
not me
i have waited all i am going to wait for Mr Gallagher tonight
and a very pleasant wait it was
i had a swell time
Thanks
Thank you
you have been very kind
you let me talk myself hoarse and you never interrupted me and you did not let on that i bored you
now you are just making talk
no
Well good night
no good night kiss
Well that proves something
i have been asleep all night and you are just something i dreamed about
do you have these nightmares often
Well say hello to Blackie for me
Tell him i am sorry he could not make it
Well at any rate when Blackie talks about you now
i will know what he means
Well good night
Good night
ELEVATOR BELL BUZZES
Your overcoat
Well i had a marvelous time
Sure sure i knew you would
do you good being out with a gentleman like Jim once in a while
do me good
he spoiled me
he opened doors for me and helped me in and out of cars
Imagine
and he was like that all night
he stayed right with me
no table hopping
and he did not make dice out of the sugar cubes
he would not even kiss me good night
and he thanked me for being with him
BLACKlE YAWNS
Sounds kind of dull
Wish i could get just one dull evening like that out of you once a year
you could not stand it honey
Too rich for your blood
Blackie did you ever figure ahead any further than 15 minutes
Sure sure right now i got bets on the World Series for next October
i do not mean that
i mean us you and i
Did you ever figure where we might wind up
Say Jim must have had a terrific effect on you
Terrific
Terrific
i saw so much i want and haven't got
Security consideration a shelter Blackie someplace to get in out of the rain
i only tasted them tonight but i saw enough to know i want that more than anything else in this world
Say what are you trying to do make an honest man out of me
Why not
it is been done
People in love get married all the time
you love me do not you
Sure
Sure i do but
and i love you dear
Blackie let's live like human beings
Let's quit running around like a pack of wolves
Why won't you let me have what i want
my own home my own kids
you are talking a lot of hooey right out of nice clean storybooks
there is nothing you really want that you haven't got
this other stuff marriage a nice little home with roses around the door you are not the type
Blackie
now wait a minute
Let me talk
you got a big load of Jim tonight probably did you a lot of good outside of these silly notions
but get this Jim's as much out of your class as he is out of mine
i used to get ideas too listening to Jim ideas about being something
but i forgot them because they are not my stuff
and you forget yours too because whether you know it or not two weeks of being a sweet little wife and waiting for hubby to come home and having babies while you are waiting you'd go crazy
all right
Goodbye Blackie
what is this
do not be silly
i am not being silly
i was once but i am all right now
now i know what i want
i know where i am going
Blackie up to a minute ago i loved you very dearly
you were all that mattered to me
but right now i can not even remember having been in love with you
Wait a minute now baby
no that won't ever work again either
Blackie i got some ideas of my own now
they may be old and discarded
like oil lamps or horse cars but they are mine and i am stuck with them
i know it is the very latest style to be cynical and callous about stupid things like marriage and home and babies but maybe i do not like the very latest style
Maybe i want to wear last year's hat
i give it all back to you Blackie including the yacht
i want you to have that yacht
Goodbye Blackie

WHlSTLE BLOWlNG
you too Spud
but boss you promised me
BLACKlE
Beat it
the whistles have stopped Manny
a couple of months ago
i might have felt sorry for you and let you crawl out but a lot of things have happened to me since then and i do not feel the same about you anymore
you can not do it you can not
not in cold blood Blackie
you better cross yourself Manny and make it double because this is once you doubled crossed yourself
Wait a minute Blackie wait a minute
i will give it to you
i will pay you off
Look what is that behind you
GUN FlRES
GROANS GLASS TlNKLlNG THUDDlNG
where is your overcoat
huh coat
yes yes your coat
you were wearing a coat weren't you
Gee boss i left it back there in the room
i will go get it
no no do not be silly
the cops are there by now
Look can they identify that as yours
i only wish they could
it was Jim's coat
what
Jim
Why you stupid
i told you to return that coat weeks ago
i know it i ought to have my head examined
Why did not you just leave my name and address
we gotta figure out something
Gee it was a swell coat too
i was only wearing it till mine was ready
Your what was ready
my overcoat i wanted one just like Jim's but i could not figure out where he got it
there was no marks or labels in it so i had my tailor make one exactly like it
mine will be ready first thing in the morning
Say look you had Jim's coat copied exactly by your tailor
yeah
Palsy i think everything is gonna be all right
Just as the cops said not a mark on it
not even a dealer's jobber's or a manufacturer's number
Doesn't give us a thing
what about the hotel people do not they know who registered for the room
no
the name was a phony of course and i had the clerk downtown he went over half the pictures in the gallery and could not pick anybody or else he did not want to
the same with the bellboy
if he knows anything he is not saying
it is a tough one chief as bad as the Rothstein case
it is kind of rotten for you taking one like this your first day and your chair is not even warm
is Blackie Gallagher out there
yes sir
Say you do not think he knows anything about it do you
Show him in will you please
yes sir
Well here we are
it is been months as usual
Sit down
you are headman of the city now
next you are going to be headman of the state and then
Skip it kid skip it
i did not get you down here to hear again how good i am
Pardon my enthusiasm
what is on your mind
Well first of all i wanted to tell you about Eleanor
what about Eleanor
we are thinking of getting married
what married
yes you know man and wife it is an old custom
any reason why we should not
no no i can not think of any
it just surprised me that is all
i never figured Eleanor
Say she could not make a better choice and she is a swell gal and i hope you both click
Thanks Blackie i knew you'd say that
Why should not i say that
we have been pals all of our lives
Well Eleanor and i were good pals too but
Hey everything is just hotsy totsy
Say look i got a date uptown
i gotta beat it
Give my best to Eleanor
Say wait a minute kid
i am much obliged to you for returning my overcoat
a little round about the police found it in room 14 B at the Uptown Hotel where Manny Arnold was killed
Your overcoat
what are you talking about
Come on Blackie you never could kid me
that is the coat i loaned Eleanor last election night and it is the coat the murderer left behind him after killing Manny Arnold
i would not kid you mister
Maybe the nasty old murderer did leave that coat but that is not your coat
Blackie
Hey wait a minute
i wanna find out something
Spud
yeah
yeah
Look slug how come you did not return Jim's coat like i told you to weeks ago
Well to tell you the truth i kind of forgot
you kind of forgot
yeah well your kind of forgetting kind of got me into a lot of trouble
now suppose you kind of get on the phone and kind of tell the butler to jump in a cab and bring that coat down here right away
it is in the closet
okay boss
Beat it
you know i am really working wonders with Spud
i got him where he eats with a fork now
what is the gag
Gag
there is no gag
Your coat'll be here any minute now
Blackie let's face the facts
Manny Arnold owed you a lot of money
you quarreled with him election night when he would not pay up
you threatened him
i threatened him
Sure i threatened him so did everybody else
that is the only way you could get your dough out of that chiseler
i got mine
Why should i wanna kill him
i do not know unless you did not get yours
and i know what you think of welshers
Blackie i am not interested in anything but the fact that Manny Arnold was murdered
and i have got to find the murderer
i know you have
and if anybody can do it you are the man that will
now look do not you think i have got more sense than to try to pull anything knowing you the way i do
i hope so
we are in a tough spot now
my job means fighting you and your crowd
and Blackie i am going to fight
i never saw the day i was big enough to lick you
i have got too many guys in my gang
you are going to find yourself getting away with less and less kid and it is going to be my fault
we had one or two crooked inspectors
Well they are gone now
no more paid cops no more quashed indictments no more handpicked juries all gone
i am going to clean out every rotten spot i can find in this city
and Blackie i do not wanna find you in one of them
and if you do
what do you think
you are gonna give me everything i got coming to me
you are gonna nail me every time i step out of line and sock me to the limit
you said it
and cockeyed as it all sounds
i will be proud of you
What'd you think of that
Well how about the Manny Arnold killing
all right i will bite
what about it
i may have to get an indictment against you
are you still harping on that coat
i tell you Jim that is not your coat
now if you are not satisfied when it gets here you know i will always be around when you want me
yes i know that
Well i gotta beat it
Goodbye old timer
so long kid
i will be seeing you
Right
Pardon me
Pardon me
do you want these homicide squad reports
no
not now thanks
this just came for you
how do you think this fits me
Why all right i guess
i could not tell for sure
what another one
Looks like it doesn't it
where did this come from
how does that fit
Why just about the same
Just the same huh
Well do not get them mixed up because this is my coat
yeah the jury just went out
Hey am i late
Did Miss Adams
yes she did unpack my stuff
is Blackie Gallagher here
Blackie Gallagher
yes he is going with me to the church
he should have been here an hour ago
Get him on the phone will you please
yes sir
Mr Wade
i am sorry Miss Adams i am afraid i am going to be late for my own wedding
you are not really going to have Blackie Gallagher there
Why he'd better be there
he is going to be my best man
i am sorry
Why what is on your mind
oh but you should not you can not
Everybody knows what Blackie Gallagher is
Think of what the papers will say
the papers
Well most of the papers were against me at the election but i was elected
but this is different
this can hurt you
Remember what happened to that district attorney in Chicago just for having his picture taken with some gangsters at dinner
and now right on top of the Manny Arnold case
Well what about the Manny Arnold case
some people know you had Blackie Gallagher down here
they think he killed Manny Arnold that you let him go just out of friendship
what people think doesn't matter to me
i do what i think is right
as district attorney i am convinced that Blackie had nothing to do with it
he is my friend
he is going to be best man at my KNOCK ON DOOR
Come in
i tried to get Gallagher on the phone but he doesn't answer
this just came for you
that is all Miss Adams
i am sorry i opened it
i thought it might be office business
Tell Miss Adams she can rest easy because Blackie Gallagher seems to feel the same way she does about it
yes sir
Well my dear
Father will you and Eleanor wait right over there while i tend to the bags
Keep an eye out for Blackie
Porter
it was sweet of you Father to come all the way down from Sing Sing to marry us
you won't get in any trouble marrying non Catholics will you
not at all
besides did not i fish Jim out of the East River once
i should have some rights huh
about Blackie you know i use to be in love with Blackie
yes i know
but there is only Jim in my life now and from now on
you believe that do not you
Completely but
what did you want to tell me about Blackie
Blackie loves you Father
i have heard him say it many times
he needs you
he needs you more than any of us
i want you to help him before it is too late
you know you fished Blackie out of the East River too
from now on your principle trouble is Jim
i will take care of Blackie but i will make no promises
did not Blackie promise to come down and see you both off
yes but he is always late
Father I'd rather not see Blackie just now
will you see him and say goodbye for us
all right all set
Bye bye Father

Imagine me the Governor's wife
Hey wait a minute
i have only been nominated
Well i can not be worried about details
I'd love you just as much darling if you were Vice President of the United States
i will bet you say that to all the boys
do not you
oh
Well hello Snow
how did you get in here
they do not know downstairs yet that you have soured on your assistant
Allow me to congratulate you Governor
that can wait until November
i have not been elected yet
but you are a cinch
it is in the bag
you haven't got me to weaken the ticket
and you were going to make them run me as district attorney
you were going to put up a fight for me
i am sorry to say that i did put up a fight
when i told them last night that unless you were on the ticket they could count me out
i learned a number of things that i never knew before
Darling would you mind
Please dear
Good night Mr Snow
Snow in all the years i have worked with you
i have disregarded the gossip about you
i refused to believe the Citizens' Nonpartisan outfit
but last night from our own people i got the proof
you are nothing but a cheap chiseling grafter
the party won't stand for you and i won't
you not only do not go on the ticket as district attorney but from tonight you are not even my chief assistant any longer
Well that is just too bad
have you finished your address to the jury
because if you have there are a couple of points i would like to make
it is a shame you are quitting the DA's office with the Manny Arnold case unsolved
i do not feel very happy about that
i simply could not find the murderer that is all
you could not find the murderer
you did not even try to find him
you could have by asking in any speakeasy in New York City
Everybody knows who killed Manny Arnold
that is everybody except our district attorney whose best pal Blackie Gallagher happened to be the killer
Wait a minute
you know as well as i do we had no case against Blackie
we made every possible effort to trace that coat
you made a lot of weak futile gestures if that is what you mean by effort
Why did not you get an indictment against Gallagher
that is what the people would like to know
i am not going to discuss it with you Snow
for reasons of my own and as district attorney
i am convinced that Blackie had nothing to do with it
now get out
all right but i am gonna open this case so wide that the voters will run you out of town
You'd better get another story because i do not think they like the one you have got
Perhaps they'd rather believe the one that is going around the one i will tell that you would not hold Gallagher because you would not prosecute your wife's ex
you better get your nose out of that program Blackie
Somebody's looking at you awfully hard
yeah
who
Somebody you used to know a long time ago
where is she
you find her
what am i running a lonely hearts club
i will be right back
now look here
i said I'd be right back
can i have a hot dog
hello Mrs Governor
hello Blackie
where is the law and order
he is supposed to meet me here but you know this business of running for governor
i am going to have to sue that campaign manager of his for alienation of affections
what is on your mind
Why nothing nothing at all
no trouble between you and Jim i hope
nothing in the world could cause trouble between Jim and me
that goes for me too
but what is the trouble
Something's wrong and i want to know what it is
i am worried about Jim's campaign about the election
is that all
Well you can stop worrying right now and start planning your dress for the inauguration
he is a cinch
he was until they brought up the Manny Arnold case again
Manny Arnold
Why what about it
Jim insists that this won't hurt him but his campaign manager tells me that the election would have been close anyway and that this will
ANNOUNCER ON PA
Turn to your programs please
Number one Commander the Billing's entry was scratched at the last moment
Imagine that
i had three bucks on that plug and he ain't gonna run now because he is scratched
Imagine that
a great big horse like that and they won't let him run because he is got a little scratch
LAUGHlNG
Say who are these guys
Why the dirty
it is just one man Snow
he used to be Jim's assistant
he has a grudge against Jim and he is waiting until just before election to spring everything
yeah
yeah i remember him now

Blackie do not do anything foolish
Blackie
Did i ever do anything foolish

CROWD CHEERlNG

Honey Snow was murdered last night in Madison Square Garden

PHONE RlNGlNG
hello
yes
Police headquarters
it is for you
Wade speaking
what
all right i will be down in just a little while
what is it
they made an arrest
who
Blackie
Nice of you to come and see me like this
Put you to a lot of trouble
you are crazy to come here
Suppose somebody spotted you
i can see the headlines now DA's wife in secret visit to slayer
That'd be fine
but i had to come Blackie
it was because of what i said to you at Belmont
you said you'd do something about Snow
you have got it all figured out haven't you
Hey look what are you going to wear on the witness stand
Blackie please
i haven't told Jim yet
i wanted to see you first
and i thought you were smart
that is what i always liked about you
you were even smart enough to walk out on me
but i will have to tell him
that is great
the one thing they haven't got on me is a motive
so the DA's wife pops out with a pip
but Jim will understand
Jim will help you
Blackie you have got to tell me
Did you kill Snow
now do not be silly
you do not kill rats like Snow
you do not have to
Hey look tell me something
what
you in love with Jim
i love Jim more than anything else in this world
i never knew what love was Blackie until i met Jim
all right then if you love Jim as much as you say you do and you want to see him governor keep quiet
Hey look you do not know that guy as well as i know him
Above everything else in the world he is the district attorney remember that
now if you tell what happened at Belmont he will put you on the witness stand
and then where will he be when he comes to his campaign for governor
Well what about you
it is your life
they haven't got a thing on me as long as you keep quiet
you know Blackie for a while i was almost ashamed of having loved you but i am not now
i am proud
yeah
Well i think you are okay too
GUARD
Time's up
okay
so long Eleanor
Goodbye Blackie
Everybody rise
the prosecution will proceed
Your Honor
District Attorney Wade intended to make the closing address himself but as you know he is in the midst of his campaign for governor
he apparently has been delayed
we expect him any minute
Well the court sees no reason why politics should be permitted to hinder or delay the conduct of such an important case
the prosecution will proceed
with or without Mr Wade
ASSlSTANT
Just a moment please Your Honor
what a break for us
i shall insist on starting without Wade
Sit down
we will wait
but it will gives us a chance to
Chance my eye
as far as you are concerned this trial is over
i will hand you one thing though you have been licked by the best
now keep your eyes open and learn something
Your Honor
Gentlemen of the jury
i
GAVEL BANGlNG
ASSlSTANT
i have started
i beg the court's pardon for this unfortunate delay
we were about to proceed without you Mr Wade
Hereafter i trust you will not again allow your political activities to cause delay
i trust not Your Honor
Class it is written all over him
Class
Your Honor
Gentlemen there is very little more that i can say to you
the state has tried Blackie Gallagher for the murder of Richard Snow
the defense was quick to point out as their only defense that we could establish no clear indisputable motive for the crime
Well gentlemen murder without motive seems to be the fashion of the day
and it is just this vicious practice which we must stamp out
for years men and women in this country tolerated racketeers and murderers
because of their own hatred of prohibition they felt in sympathy with those who broke a law they felt to be oppressive
Crime and criminals became popular
Killers became heroes
but gentlemen prohibition has gone and these gangsters and killers who came with it must go with it
the defense has pointed out Snow's shady character has indicated his large number of personal enemies
i concur with their opinion
i found it necessary myself to dismiss him from public office
but Richard Snow was a man killed by another man
the law makes no distinctions
Murder cannot go unpunished
our testimony against Blackie Gallagher could not have been more complete if we had had an eyewitness to the murder
we have proved that he was practically caught in the act
you have heard a fake blind beggar testify
he heard the shot and saw Gallagher come out of the room in which he had been alone with Snow
there is conflicting testimony from various parties at the Garden that night
but Gallagher's own party is the only one to insist that he did not leave his box
we have eight witnesses to the fact that he did
Gentlemen in finding Blackie Gallagher guilty of murder we are faced with more than the avenging of one death
we are faced with the choice which we must make
Either we can surrender to an epidemic of crime and violence which will destroy our homes and our community or we can give warning to the host of other gangsters and murderers that they are through
in 1904 when the General Slocum burned
i made a boyish effort to save Blackie Gallagher's life
Today i demand from you his death
PEOPLE CHATTERlNG GAVEL BANGlNG
JUDGE
Gentlemen of the jury you are instructed that the defendant is under the laws of the State of New York presumed to be innocent of the crime with which he is charged
who
oh yeah until he is proven guilty to your satisfaction by competent evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt
this presumption remains with the defendant throughout the trial
and unless you are satisfied that he is guilty of the crime charged and this beyond any reasonable doubt then you must acquit him of the charge
a reasonable doubt is such a doubt as a man of reasonable intelligence can give some good reason for entertaining if he is called upon to do so
is he coming
have you heard from him
i haven't heard a word
not a word
ALL CLAMORlNG
MAN
we have been waiting more than half an hour outside
MAN 2
Mr Wade the district attorney's office wants you on the phone right away
hello
this is Wade
the jury just came in on the Blackie Gallagher case
Verdict guilty first degree
you are practically up in Albany right now
Say if that doesn't put you in the governor's chair and me in the district attorney's office i will miss my guess
Well congratulations to both of us
Come on Governor
they will be tearing up the seats in a minute
i am afraid they will have to tear
i can not speak not tonight
Why what is happened
Bad news
Wife
Friend
Sick
Going to die
Blackie Gallagher has been convicted of first degree murder
i am sorry
the defendant will rise and face the bench
have you anything to say before sentence is pronounced upon you
not a thing
Edward J Gallagher the judgment of the court is that you
Edward J Gallagher for the murder in the first degree of one Richard Snow whereof you are convicted to be sentenced to the punishment of death and it is ordered that you be delivered to the warden of the Sing Sing prison at Ossining New York where during the week beginning Monday February the 15th next the said warden is commanded to do execution upon you
Wait a minute lady that is not allowed
Let me talk to him please
Blackie
SPUD
hello boss
be a sport leave a pal talk to him will you
so long
SPUD
so long boss
JlM
i do solemnly swear that i will support the constitution of the United States
and the constitution of the State of New York
and i do further solemnly swear that i will permit no concern other than the good of the state to influence me in the exact performance of those duties which herewith i undertake
APPLAUSE
BLACKlE
i was getting to like that cell
Why do i have to move to another one for just 12 hours
you ought to be happy Blackie
them 12 hours is all you got left to move in
Cheerful little fellow is not he
does he crack jokes like that all the time
PRlSONER
so long Blackie
BLACKlE
so long boy
PRlSONER 2
so long Blackie
Goodbye black boy do not take no wooden pork chops
no sir
you better take these with you
Give you something to do in these next 12 hours
down there in that dance hall cell all by yourself
you can not miss with them any way you shoots them
Thanks
PRlSONER 3
so long Blackie
BLACKlE
so long kid
Shorty
Hey Shorty music
THE BAD IN EVERYMAN PLAYlNG
Keep your chin up and your nose clean kid
Forget about that commutation
you do not want it anyway
Die the way you lived all of a sudden
that is the way to go
do not drag it out
Living like that doesn't mean a thing
PRlSONER 4
so long Blackie
so long big boy
hello Blackie
Hiya Warden
anything i can do
you can order whatever you want to eat you know
yes so i read in the papers
no thanks
how about a drink
Well i am not supposed to give you a drink
they got laws in the death house too
but if it will help i will bring you one
Thanks
yeah look there is something you can do for me
Call up Hattie Carnegie and tell her to send over a black lace nightgown to Toots Malone Mammoth Hotel
she is been wanting one
Kind of a going away present
you know
i ask you to commute Blackie Gallagher's sentence to life imprisonment
first because no really sufficient motive has ever been discovered for this crime and secondly because you yourself were elected to your present high office mainly through the public acclaim you received through the conviction of your own friend
Certainly more than any other governor in the history of this state you
Your Excellency can afford in this case to be merciful
no one can be more conscious than i am of my present position here
it has troubled me more deeply than it could anyone else
the men and women of this state elected me partly because i was instrumental in the sentencing of Blackie Gallagher to the electric chair
those men and women have a right to expect that i will not be corrupted by money influence or even by my own personal feelings
the defendant has been tried according to the laws of this state
he has been found guilty and sentenced to death
this decision has been upheld by the Court of Appeals
you have presented no new evidence no cause to change the verdict of the court
the application for commutation of the death sentence of Edward J Gallagher for the crime of murder in the first degree is herewith denied
hello dear
what are you going to do about Blackie
nothing there is nothing i can do
you can save his life
he is guilty
the jury says so
Please stop talking like the governor of a great state
Talk to me as my husband as the man i love about another man we both love
Jim are you going to kill Blackie
can you kill him
you could not do that to Blackie
not Blackie
i can not commute his sentence because of our feeling for him the fact that we both love him the fact that i will never understand why he killed Snow if he did
Suppose i told you why he killed Snow
Suppose i told you he did it for you would that mean anything to you
i do not know what you are talking about
i met him at the Belmont races
i told him Snow had threatened you and i asked him to help us
Blackie did not care anything about laws or verdicts or right or wrong
you were in trouble and that was all that mattered to him
he would not even let me tell you
he thought that if you knew you'd ruin your own chances of being elected
do you realize what this means
it means that if it weren't for Blackie Gallagher you would not be governor today
it means that the state has finally found a motive for the killing of Snow
there is not a chance now
i can not convince myself that anyone
least of all you could be so hard and cold
anyone who is loved me who is been so tender
Darling please
i tried to stop Blackie
i told him
i warned him at the time of the Manny Arnold case
you must realize i have my sworn duty
Sworn duty
could you put yourself in Blackie's place
could you apply all your fine and honorable rules to yourself punish yourself as calmly and completely as you have Blackie
i do not think you could Jim
i know you could not
that has nothing to do with it
i must do what i believe is right
then i must too
i think it is right to leave you if you let Blackie die
we have no chance of ever being happy again
Jim doesn't that mean anything to you
you can not leave me
you must not
Well then keep me here
Jim do you realize what you are sacrificing for the sake of some principles
Blackie's life my love our happiness are they worth that to you
Eleanor
do not go
i need you
will you save Blackie
no
Get me a car
i am going to Sing Sing
i want a motorcycle escort
i got to be there before midnight
SlRENS BLARlNG
Listen i tell you it was me croaked that guy
Blackie Gallagher did not do it
you got it all wrong
Say you ain't the guy that bumped off the Archduke of Austria are you
no that was not me
MEN LAUGHlNG
i guess i ought to know who i bumped off
i tell you Blackie did not know nothing about it
there was thousands of people there that night
Everybody seen me
he did not know nothing about it i tell you
i swear it
you dummies
Listen it was like this it was during the intermission see and I'd been drinking too much lemonade
BLACKlE
you dirty so and so's
you haven't shown me a natural since i have been in here
Already
no
someone to see you
Well i am not dressed for company
Well hello Jim
when you are ready Governor just call
Thank you Warden
Come on come on sit down here
here take this nice easy chair
Well so i am going to have the Governor to see me off huh
Am i getting the keys to the city too
Blackie i know why you killed Snow
she should not have told you that
i asked her not to
she thought it would help you
but you know what it means
Well that is okay Jim
i was not expecting anything
Blackie what a terrific thing for you to do and for me
Forget it
i can never forget it
the pity of it is there is nothing i can ever do to repay you
you see Blackie
Save it save it
i heard you at the trial
SlGHS
what a finish
what
not so bad
Fresh towels running water even a mattress
they say two Gun Crowley went to sleep
they had to wake him up to take him to the chair
it must be that black coffee i drank why i am not sleepy
when you grin like that you make me think of a little kid on the East Side
we won't go into that
Blackie i should have stopped you
Years ago i could have done it too
when Old Man Rosen died it was up to me to take care of you but i was too busy
Too busy getting to be governor so i could send you to the chair
Say you did everything anybody could do
i am just a no good guy that is all
Well hello Father
Just in time for Old Home Week
i am glad you came Jim
you know we were almost back to the time where you pulled us both out of the river
now you see you just wasted your time
now you have got to go and put me back again
Well we all got to be given back sooner or later Blackie
is not that marvelous
anything you say anything you do he turns it around and puts it into religion
Except that time i knocked a home run through your stained glass window down on Hester Street
Boy i will never forget that
that is funny that doesn't seem so long ago
and to think this is the first time the three of us have been together since the East Side
a funny kind of a reunion
Well anyway this is once i was not late
uh oh that man's in again
i am afraid you better say goodbye Jim
Goodbye Jim
i can not do it Blackie
i have got to commute you
have you lost your mind
now you have made your decision now stick to it
Look as far as i am concerned you are the best friend i ever had
but above everything else you are the Governor
i can not do this to you
but you have got to
do not you see
you are right
you get that
you are right
where do you get off commuting me
i am not afraid to spill it
i not only got Snow but i killed Manny Arnold too
i can not help it Blackie
i am not going to let you die
i can not do it
Say do you think you are doing me a favor by keeping me locked up in this filthy trap for the rest of my life
you are going to make a great sacrifice ruin your career for what
So's that i can rot in this hole
would you do that to me
no thanks
do not commute me i do not want it
Hey look Jim if i can not live the way i want then at least let me die when i want
Come on Warden
Let's go
here
Give it to him
he needs it more than i do
Blackie
what
Goodbye Blackie
so long Jim
Hey hey do not be silly

GUARD
this way out Governor
PRlSONER
there he goes
they are giving it to him
GUARD
Quiet
Ladies and gentlemen quiet please quiet
his Excellency the Governor
Mr Speaker
ladies and gentlemen of the Assembly and the Senate
a joint session of your two bodies called by me as governor of the state is an unusual procedure
it is necessitated by unusual circumstances
a few nights ago as you all know
Edward J Gallagher was put to death in the electric chair at Sing Sing for the crime of murder
what you do not know is that he committed the murder to silence scandal about me which very likely would have cost my election to the governorship
the scandal is now unimportant
but what is important is that when i learned of what Gallagher had done for me
i let my affection for him blind me in my sworn duty to the people of this state
i offered him a commutation of his death sentence
the fact that he refused my offer is no mitigation of my offense
my election was won with murder and i have proven myself unworthy of my trust
and i can do nothing less than tender you my resignation as governor of the State of New York
MAN
no Governor
no
ALL
no
no
no

how do you know that
i know you
you do not know Henry Linden
i know the type
he is one of the love will Come after marriage boys

Get that into your Nasty little mind

Bookworms
Friends of yours
Friends of each other i hope
all right David
what is on your mind
Well it hasn't anything to do with my mind
i am
here on an errand
Sort of an errand of bad will
Hannah asked you to come
she is worried about you
i have never been in Better health in my life
she is not worried about your health
oh my mind perhaps
she feels if you came home for a while
Perhaps your
Sense of values
would become her sense of values is that it
Your point or rather Hannah's point
it doesn't make any difference
is that Olivia's not good Enough for the lindens
my point is there is not a Linden good enough for her
and as points go it is a Pretty shabby one Henry
you are no judge of that David
Well perhaps not but you should be
you have Eyes and ears
Look around you at her friends
Listen to what they say
the cream of cafe society
so witty so gay and so brittle
i will take the village halfwit back home
now that is Enough David
Why you are behaving like a naive little schoolboy
we are not being prudes about this but
Well after all Why marry
David that is enough
Henry
there is a reporter Out there darling
will you go tell him how Deliriously happy you are
are not you Coming too
i have already told him
i gather you are not drunk with joy over this marriage
i think you are Making a mistake
you think Henry's Making a mistake
both of you are
you see
i do not think you'd Like us very much
you mean you would not like me
Why do not you let me decide what i mean by what i say
so i am to give up Henry
because his brother is Insufferable and smug
Well that depends on the point of view
Tell me where did you ever Find anyone good enough for you
all right you want it
here it is
when Henry and i walked in here just now
we interrupted a very romantic couple
Well you should have coughed
i was too busy thinking what would happen if he ever walked in
and discovered you in the same situation
Tell that to the boys behind the barn
that miss Riley is exactly what i mean
Your life will be full of peace and joy
and the home which you are establishing
will abide through every vicissitude
Maggie Riley wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband
to live together in the holy state of matrimony
Wilt thou love him Comfort him
Honor and keep him in sickness and in health
and forsaking all others Keep thee only unto him
so long as ye both shall live
i will
Well here they come
Gives you a funny Feeling like
Watching the enemy fly in
Look David what will i tell her if she asks about Hannah
Hey David
what will i tell her if she asks about Hannah
you won't have to tell her
she will know
hello
hello
hello
i am Judy David's wife
hello Judy
i will never trust David again
he just said you were beautiful
and let it go at that
oh
that is a lot from David is not it
i am grateful

Marriage does that for a boy

and lose all your teeth
you will have to watch him like a hawk
all the lindens Eat like pigs

oh your maid got in this morning
she has already been Chased by bulls
Well uh do not worry about belvedere
by tomorrow she will be chasing them

Hannah always takes a Nap in the afternoon
Strange
Somehow i imagined
Hannah never slept
Like Scotland yard
Belvedere i hear you have been upsetting our bulls

i thought those cows was acting funny
hello belvedere
hello miss Olivia
hello Hannah
hello Henry
Hannah this is Olivia
hello Hannah

Thank you Hannah

and more
would you like to go to your room Olivia
yes thank you
and may i have a drink please
Certainly
there is a bottle of whiskey on the sideboard David
i got it out this morning
Why you i meant a drink of water
but do not let me Deprive you
you probably need an Eyeopener after your nap
i never drink Whiskey
oh stop Pretending Hannah
you know you get stiff as a plank every afternoon
David please
Well actually I'd much Rather have a cup of tea
yes we will all have some
Go on David
See about it
all right
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Put them in the west Room leonard
yes miss Linden
and do not try to take them all on one trip
These skimpy bags
Why we are practically camping out
Belvedere's going to come in Mighty handy in the spring
we won't need that new tractor
Come on
i will help you unpack
i won't need any Help thank you
Belvedere can manage
i did not really Want to help you unpack
i just wanted to stare at what is in those bags
i have got some clothes i keep just for showing
i would not Dare wear them
oh i have got a nightgown just like that
it came all the way from paris
i keep it hidden Under the linen
it is just as i Thought it would be
what
everything
the house this room
Look at that bed
Where'd they ever get it do you suppose
oh i should think an early Linden made it
Out of a couple of Indians and an old tree
how early were the lindens Judy
the very earliest i mean
the very earliest
Mm hmm
oh no one knows Really
i should think sometime Shortly before genesis
what about you
i imagine your family was pretty Upset when the lindens showed up
Well i was the little Girl next door 38 miles down the road
i met David when i was 6
he put a frog down my dress
Poured ink over my hair
and naturally i have been in love with him ever since
i have been a Linden now for
and i have got no Right here have i
as much right as anyone
that doesn't answer my question
do they think anyone has any right here
oh
i see what you mean
it must seem very Strange to you
Almost indecent for a family to go on
for generation after generation
Living the same kind of life all over again
so complacent and smug about what it already has and
Afraid of what it hasn't
that is about it
and when you said do they think
you meant does Hannah think
and David and
Sometime maybe even Henry
oh no you are wrong
it is Hannah
no matter what they think it is always Hannah
Well that doesn't make it any easier does it
you know you must not be Frightened Olivia
i am a little
of Hannah
oh i can see you are more than a match for her
and i like you Very much
but you have hardly set eyes on me Judy
Even so i have a kind of a feeling
i am always having them about nearly everyone
you will be happy here Olivia
oh i want to so much
how is David's Playing
he is given it up Lately
he should not
he is too good
now it is nice to See you again Hannah
Nice to see you Henry
you haven't Changed a bit
i wish i could say the same for you
i haven't Exactly changed
Just improved
Aw come on Hannah
Relax and be pleasant
this is not going to get any of us anywhere
i want you to make the Best of a good bargain
i am married
Olivia is your sister in law
that is your doing Henry not mine
oh come out from behind those prejudices
you like her do not you
i make it a rule never to Trust first impressions
Too bad i did not Teach you the same
you will like her very much when you know her
i won't forget that she is your wife Henry
i want more than that
you are to be extremely Pleasant to her
of course
i mean that Hannah
you needn't bite my head off
i said i would did not i
who is biting whose head off
with tea Practically here
Henry seems to Think i haven't
Gushed sufficiently over Olivia
Well you were just a bit cold I'd say
the hall's still Full of icicles
and to what do you attribute
the sudden change in your opinion
that is easy Olivia
will that be all miss Linden
yes thank you Leonard
David guess what i have decided
i haven't been Able to so far
that i haven't got and never did have
a single thing to wear
oh
Hannah you have got to Go up right after tea
and try them all on one by one
Possibly Olivia's too Tired to show them to me
Nonsense
I'd love to
you better not
we have got 2 000 cows
that are used to the way Hannah dresses
they are pretty Sensitive to change
there is a wonderful Native sarong
that you just wrap around with one button
that is hardly Likely
Fortunately i have neither
the inclination or the torso
how do you Take it Olivia
Perfectly Straight please
Thank you
what will you have Olivia
Egg sandwich Bacon sandwich
Buttered toast Cookies or pound cake
Just a piece of toast please
Strawberry jam Raspberry jam
Grape jelly or marmalade

Flying to Milwaukee for a couple of hours
and listen do not overdo on the digging
if a weed or two Escapes what of it
but i love digging
Perhaps it is not that Olivia Loves digging so much as
she loves a slim figure more
Perhaps it is that you have Called the turn Hannah

they may be my special Yellow lilies
one lily i dug up one and a runt at that
Bye
Whew
oh please play

Funny
I'd been thinking it was stuffy in here
I'd go out in the garden for a breath of air
you are a funny kind of farmer David
do you like it
some of the time
and the rest of the time
i hate it
but i have been that way Always about everything
i want what i haven't got
and i am bored with what i have
but i have stopped Wondering about it
i just call myself a neurotic
and your music
i hadn't played in a Long time until you came
it bored me
then suddenly i wanted to play
you knew i was playing for you did not you
and Judy
Judy won't be able to ride with us this afternoon
she has some errands in the village
will you be ready about 4 00

Like it
Like it
oh but you are so used to it
you do not know the thrill of Suddenly coming upon something
so beautiful it takes Your breath away
i think i do
i uh wish Judy had been able to ride with us

Why do you want me to be happy
Well i do not
oh oh look David
See that knoll beside the lake

Henry and i
you arrived here hating me
what is made you change
it will be all the homes i have ever Wanted to have rolled into one
Henry and i have Compromised on ideas
Everything's to be my way
it will be white and colonial
with a big porch facing the lake for me to eat crackly pig on and grow fat
and a huge green lawn that Slopes to the water's edge
with horseshoe pitching for me and a dainty little teahouse for Henry
Stop talking about Henry and you and your rotten little house
i am sorry
i am sorry for what i Said to you in new york
or even coming to new york
that is all right David
i forgave you then Forgive you now
and a blanket pardon for all future trespasses
you were right to have slapped me
i was so complacent and smug and sure
it is all right David
Let's forget about it
Henry back yet
Mm hmm
he is upstairs changing
he said Milwaukee was Hotter than you know where
what is a 3 letter word for
i suppose David hasn't got back yet
no
do you think it wise Judy
Hmm

to let David go about with her so much
do you think it is wise for Olivia
to let Henry play checkers with me so much
that is different
but why
i find Henry Very attractive
you do not really Judy
do you think it is wise for Henry to let Olivia
Spend so much time with David
no
Quite honestly i do not
Tell me have you seen any signs of their falling madly in love
no of course not yet
Neither have i
Yet
while i am waiting it seems i have just enough time
before dinner to de flea a few dogs
oh and if they show any immediate tendency
to break an important Commandment whistle will you
i am sorry Judy
my intentions were good
yes i am sure they were Hannah
it is just that you were born with a strong sense of interference
and i am afraid you will die with one
hi Hannah
what are you so cheerful about
Why not
i have half a mind to tell you why not
Hannah why do not you have all your Teeth pulled out
it sometimes helps
i do not know whether that Gelding's better than i thought
or whether it is the way Olivia rode him

i do not think that is David's trouble
Well suppose we do not Worry about it huh
i have half an idea he is Falling in love with you
that is half an idea you have wasted

Ever since we arrived
Look Henry

Like plumbing fixtures or farm relief or something
it is not like David to act this way
it is got me worried
i am fond of David
i do not want
of course you are fond of David and David's fond of Hannah
and Hannah's fond of you
all the lindens are fond of each other and themselves
they are famous for it
and the smugness and Pettiness that goes with it

Nobody's being smug
Nobody's being petty
oh you are just Being lindens
it is too hot to walk Henry
i
i am going to bed
Olivia
Wait a minute

our last
there
i wish we could have Moved in today
but the smell of paint is too much for me
what is your hurry
we Like having you with us
you like having us with you anyway
do you know Judy
sometimes i think maybe Henry and i have built
a little bit too close to the rest of the family
Too close
to Hannah you mean
Well yes
a half mile farther away would not make any difference
Well it might Simplify matters
no it would not
it would not simplify anything
what do you mean
Olivia i suppose you know what is Wrong between you and Hannah
oh i wish i did
you have got different senses of honesty that is all
Hannah is as honest as her imagination
and her instinct will allow her to be
you have just got a much Bigger imagination
and a much deeper Instinct
Thank you Judy
Olivia why did you Marry Henry
Why did i marry him when i was not in love with him
yes
because i liked him Very much
because i was alone
because i did not like any of the things i did
and the people i did them with
and
Well just because i wanted to get married
that would shock Hannah Terribly
Doesn't it shock you
no
I'd have Done the same
i have done the same
David was never in love with me you know never
Did he think he was
oh yes but i never Enlightened him
Did you ever tell Henry that you loved him
no
Well i told David that he loved me
so you see you made the more honest bargain

Well for one thing the freckles are gone
and you have become lovely to look at
Mmm become
i do not like that word
so gradual so
Unexciting
you want to be Exciting Judy
yes more than anything else
Why
oh
so that
David might look at me and
Suddenly know that he loved me
so that he might hear a song and think of me
or that he might walk into a room I'd just left
and know I'd been there
Judy
Everything's all right is not it
Between you and David
of course Henry
Truly
yes truly
everything is just exactly as it always has been
for a moment you had me worried
Henry tell me
what did you feel when you first Saw Olivia the very first instant
that i loved her
Did you care if she loved you
Mmm at first
and then
then nothing Very much mattered
Except that i loved her
and you did not want anything more than
Just to know she was there for you to love
oh Henry she is so beautiful
so
Exciting
Judy can you come here a minute
yeah i am coming
i will be back in a minute
and we will toss off that gavotte
where is David

i did not mean anything
Everybody thinks every time i open my mouth lately i mean something
Well do not you
you do not have to do that Hannah
i like to do it
i am not all rigged up in paris Clothes and i can do what i like
i take it you do not Approve of this dress
on the contrary
i think it is a very beautiful dress Olivia
but in your opinion not Appropriate for tonight
Let's not argue about it
we do not have to agree on clothes do we
now you are being Just rude
you are very difficult to please Olivia
Hannah would you mind Telling me what it is about me
that you resent so much
Well oddly enough i do not resent you personally
i see nothing very odd in that but go on
Haven't you ever had a fixed instinct about a person
i had one about you Even before i saw you
i thought you would not fit in here and i still feel it
you are a disturbing Influence
Well as far as i can see
you are the only person i have appeared to disturb
and that doesn't Upset me very much
because i think someone should have done it long ago
are not you being Just rude now
yes i am
i have tried to be pleasant
and that is made you all the more offensive
i have endured Your petty persecutions
but now i am tired of them
so in the future if you are rude to me
i shall be infinitely Ruder to you
the general embarrassment will be considerable
now perhaps we understand each other Hannah
Perhaps
but i do not think i could ever like you Olivia
you see i happen to be Very fond of my family
do not you think i am
i do not believe you have ever been fond of anyone but yourself
oh what is the use
i haven't seen you laugh since the day you came
Well you are the first thing i have seen to laugh at
Dance with me
no David i can not
i have got an awful lot of things to do
oh just for laughs
you dance well
yeah i do pretty well with a fan too
the orchestra's Surprisingly good is not it
yes
what else can we talk about to Keep from saying what we feel
we have got to talk Haven't we
Probably another old Linden custom
Talk while you dance
oh here you are Mrs Briggs
Mr Linden has been dying to dance with you
i am afraid i can not Dance well enough
oh of course you can
she is just being modest David
she is really wonderful

that a cricket was a taxi Horn and a cow a streetcar
yes but why all this tonight
you have had fights with Hannah before

Well i do not know
the people and the music and
oh i do not know Henry

does she love you Henry
Tell me
does she love you
she is my wife
and i am your sister
i love you
there are sisters who do not love their brothers
and wives who do not Love their husbands
but who love their Husband's brother
Hannah
a woman's love should go Only one way to one man
there are women whose love Reaches out to every man
Like the tongues of a fire that capture and consume
Send her away Henry before she destroys us all
that is enough Hannah
we are both going Olivia and i
and you are sending us
Remember that
you and your hate
and your sick warped little Soul are driving us out
no Henry
you stay for your sake
i brought her here wanting her to love you just as i did
but i will leave hating you just as you hate her
Remember that
no Henry for your sake
for David for all of us
oh stop blubbering and get out
i am sick of the sight of you
the new foal's been born
Come and see it
it is too hot
must you play that
you liked it once
Well i am sick of it now
Quite sick of it
now you are just Being cheap
i am rather cheap
have you only just realized it
now we must not quarrel Like this
oh yes we must and do you know why
yes
because
because we are so much alike
because we are used to Getting everything we want
we are spoiled David
and spoiled people come to no good end
Ask Hannah
I'd rather ask you
you were happy before i came
you will be happy after i have gone away
do you believe that
i was not happy i was content
i will never be content again
oh how can you Say that
because i love you Olivia
and you love me too
the heat's pretty Terrific is not it
yes but you look cool
do i
i have been up on the ridge
it was lovely there
what made you sweat all that Way on a night like this

where is everybody
Well Henry's Adding up figures

David come here a minute
you will never learn to look after yourself
there that is better
now you can go
Thank you Judy
David is simply awful about his clothes
i wish you'd been with me on the ridge
i had the strangest Sensation
i felt suddenly that i knew everything
it is always satisfying
it must be
Well maybe i did not Know everything
but i knew for certain
that everything i did know was right
Absolutely right
what do you know Judy
Rather more than you Tonight
that is quite possible
i do not think i know anything tonight
you know you are making a big mistake
what do you mean
you know the expression 2 People being made for each other
yes
of course it is used Pretty indiscriminately
but do you believe that sometimes
Very seldom but sometimes 2 people are made for each other
and for no one else
Well do you or did not you
Well i do not know
i should imagine it happens very seldom
Mmm but when it does
it is more important than people being hurt
it is more important than anything is not it
i suppose but it depends
no it doesn't
it Doesn't depend on anything
Olivia shall i tell you Why i admire you
no please
i admire you because you are Honest with yourself and clear
It'd be an awful pity if you were ever to become blurred and messy minded
i have got to go now Judy
no there is something i want you to do
i want you to go away with David
Henry will divorce you
Henry and i are getting Out of here tonight
oh and what about David and me
we will live happily Ever after i suppose
in time you will
of course you will
you know that is not true
no Olivia you are going to do what i tell you
you are going to do what i would do
but you do not know what you are saying
Unless you take David Away with you

Knowing yourself does
most people do not in their lifetime

how little we want what we think we do
and how little we know what we have already
oh but Judy'd never want me now

Let's listen
the toll booth bandits as they refer to them have struck again
the latest robbery was at the Trestle Bridge in the Marina area except this time was more intricate
it started at the first Securities Bank where the suspects staked out their victim
a bonded money courier who was picking up 50 000
quickly in a stolen sports car
but you can rest assured that we have every available man alerted to keep an eye out for these suspects
Well thank you very much
Sergeant Joseph Getraer from the Central Los Angeles office of the California Highway Patrol
those dudes are relentless
yeah righteous bandits who deserve a righteous bust
it is pretty good Ponch
Righteous bandits

to break the sound barrier when my partner Francis Ponchiriblo heroically took off in hot pursuit
Heroically

Right

what do you mean
first of all it is gotta go to the captain
then the division commander the assistant commissioner
the commissioner get approved
all the facts have to be cleared with our legal department
then of course everything has to be done in triplicate
Triplicate
Why all the red tape
Well the department's very sensitive about lawsuits

Attorney general

Thanks
Bye
how is the job hunt going
a little tougher than you thought or
Well carry on
Keep up the good work
Ahem
what
all i was trying to say in there was you know i want him on the street getting a life not in there getting a latte
Why do not you just tell him that then
and spoil all the fun
do me a favor
what is wrong with you
uh oh
this is Juan Ramirez street name Prince John of the 9 6 Click
Push in tighter
that is uh Detective uh
what is his name again
Farr
Murderous hatred
what happens next
so no part of you is thinking i told you so huh
Internal Affairs
they have been watching Wallowski for a while
it is not uncommon to run surveillance on Gang Unit cops
got this from IA
they came to me because of your relationship with Wallowski which they know about
all right
Look at her
she is pissed off at her partner
she tried to stop him
it could be argued that she did that once the other cops arrived
it could also be argued that you thought having a compromised cop was a good idea and there was nothing i could do or say to warn you
this is a message to you from Internal Affairs
Your new friend Wallowski is under the microscope
and they want me to stay out of it
you want me to stay out of it
Dr Lightman
what do you want
every cop in the city have passed their fitness test
Police range
Police personnel only
what is Prince John got on you that makes you wanna kill him
have a nice day
it is not so much fun killing cardboard is it
Let me guess
you have seen the video
yeah
you wanna know how i got it
IA gave me that tape
now why would they be watching you do you think in your humble opinion
what you saw on that tape is my partner subduing a suspect
Trying to kill him more like
Kids like Prince John they keep guns in the wheel wells of nearby cars
he was going for a hidden gun
oh so where is the gun now then in a police evidence locker somewhere
you working with IA now
if i was you'd be at the cop shop
Answer me
what is going on between you and your partner
what are you hiding
you know you do that whole tough guy cop thing really well
but do me a favor save it for the customers all right
Look he is a mid level dealer with the 9 6s
all right
so if there was a reason to arrest him yesterday what is he doing on the street today
Herman Farr is a good man period
what your partner did on that tape is the beginning of the end for both of you
what do you care
i am just the cop you like to squeeze on the street in the sack
in the sack
that is a bit previous is not it
that beating was personal
Prince John has something on your partner and you know exactly what it is
which makes you a target
i can take care of myself
Thank you
Give this a go then
you know you do need my help
you just do not know how to ask for it do you
all right
Hey
Easy tiger

Let's make this quick
Check it out
Vigilante five 0 bitch
it is Prince John right

do not you Wallowski
Mm hm
you know the drill
oh seriously
it means we gotta go
i will be back
Speak up all right
Let's go
that tune up that Detective Farr gave you was personal right
so that means either you have unfinished business or Detective Farr is on the take
or you got something he wants
Tune up
yeah
no
Well i got it
Option two Detective Farr is on the take
that is not news to you
you are gonna take his word over a decorated cop
that was no ordinary beating
all right Farr wanted to kill him
which is why the prince here is on the run
what you see me running
my advice to you dust off your sneakers princess
we done
i need a ride home
Well protect and serve
this is the serve bit
the good news is Wallowski doesn't have much of a poker face
Pursed lips and puffed cheeks indicate resignation
Widened eyes show fear
oh yeah
we are breaking down the videos into microexpressions
i will break you down into microexpressions in a minute
Put your hand on your heart and tell me you think Wallowski's clean
what you mean clean like you
Give us the room
now look i did not mean that in a bad way
i know what you meant
have a seat
now what nurse
you came up on IA's radar the minute you and Wallowski
decided to start seeing each other
that is a business meeting
i do not have an ax to grind against her i do not
you do not trust my judgment where she is concerned
i do not wanna see you get hurt
yeah
all right
it is a little late for that now
for what
i am up to my neck in it
Come on
oh yeah copy that
North he is heading it up from here
yeah the gun was in the back
Prince John
i dropped him off an hour ago
Dr Foster can i have a word
this is not happening
Did he do this
he did not say
does he know who did this
if he did he would not be standing here talking about it
Did you ask him
he is a city cop 20 years
you asked him
Your worst nightmare he lied to you
Incoming
Detective Wallowski Internal Affairs Jenkins
Weapon please detective
what
or do you want me to arrest you here
Arrest her for what
that
on what evidence
Eyewitness
Open the gate
so i am thinking i distract the guards and you start digging
you got a spoon on you
Well we got some place here
or you could tell me the truth about Farr huh
i will get you out that way
Look Farr did not kill Prince John
you and i lifted him an hour later he is back on the street that is why he is dead
you do not believe that
so i bit my lip
Give me a break
if one of those gangbangers think you killed Prince John this is the worst possible place you could be love
Mind if i speak with my partner now
i will get you that spoon
what took you so long
she is never gonna rat out her partner
i mean you can offer any deal you like it is not gonna happen
uh huh
so that is your science speaking is it
you need me
Badly
Ha ha
this is a department investigation Dr Lightman
do you wanna look good or do you wanna get this right and look even better
if you are gaming me i will flush you down the toilet
you and Wallowski
Bollocks
you got an innocent cop sitting in jail with a target on her back
Wallowski is there because we have an eyewitness motive and no alibi
you look me in the eye and you tell me you do not have skeletons
because you know if i start looking i will find them
what do you want
Detective Farr
but not here
at my place
my comfort zone not his
when you find dirt on that woman Wallowski which i know there is
that woman
is that your science talking now
then you will give her to me too
i just saw a boy shot 95th and Chalmers
White lady cop threw him out her car then started shooting
and you said an officer was involved
Wachowski Willinski
something like that
Works the gangs up here
i thought i took your desk away
this is the 911 tape of the eyewitness
has an evasive vocal tic
the throat clearing she did it when she was making statements about Wallowski
Did you come up with this all by yourself
and if you listen to the tape in its entirety
it was definitely her
she gives unnecessary details
not answering questions directly
she is lying
Maybe she is just old
Look you keep doing that
and it just gets funnier and funnier
where did you get the 911 tape from then eh
you are not the only one with contacts
what Loker
Afraid so
next time however will you run it by me first
that throat clearing it is phlegm
she is a smoker
African coffee best on the planet

West station by South

Your partner has got an alibi this time her being in jail

he is not smiling
Calm down

Disperse those clowns

i mean they know the dead guy
they are all in the same gang together
now Luis
how you doing mate
who is that one over there
oh
he is that dangerous is he
how does Detective Farr know him
Hit me in the stomach
Back off man
is he one of the ones grabbing for power
is he
Hey if you hit me in the stomach i will pay you 50 with a smile
which one is gonna make you look better
you are crazy
Look whoever killed Prince John killed your friend over there
Right
who was it
not that lady cop
Thanks for that
all right stomach not face all right
Ha ha
that is really cool
Did you see that
you okay
oh no i am fine
Yup
you tell your IA friend i wanna talk to that one there
all right
this is not a gang war
it is more like a gang at war with itself
and he knows it
he is part of it he is
he is even picked sides
two 9 6s in two days Suarez
Busy man
first off he is not a man so try boy
See what i mean
you call this science
Well it sells books you know
Ask him why he is so happy his own gang members are dead
Speak
you got nothing on me
the lady cop killed Prince John and set him up
Why are you lying about her
you need her out of the way
you need her where she is easier to get to right
inside
you know i am with you
Killing cops
Serious business
Lawyer
no need
you are free to go
Get out of here
all right
you know him do you
i work Gangs
he is in a gang
you seem exceptionally relieved to see him walking out of here a free man
Let me guess
he asked for a lawyer
you interviewed him have you
a few times
Always with Wallowski
i got one for you
Tell Wallowski you were on the IA payroll when you started doing her
Why have you kept me waiting out here
no reason
you can go now
i want interrogation tape on him and Wallowski and any other 9 6s
Get out of here
i would but i got work to do
Let me ask you something
is this about catching corrupt cops or is this about saving your friend
because i still have an eyewitness
so you were two blocks away when you heard the shots
is that right
Why do not you let him tell us where he was
i was two blocks away
so in this one Farr is controlling the interrogation
he is warning Suarez
and the next one
we put you there
we got witnesses
we know J T has a beef with you
we just wanna hear your side of the story
i need a break
you finish this
Wallowski walks out before the interrogation is over
they have been in there for hours
she needed a tinkle
Maybe she was letting Farr blow the interrogation
is there anything here you agree on
yes
there is definitely some kind of relationship between Detective Farr and Suarez
Agreed
Farr does sound compromised at times
Well if Farr's dirty Wallowski is dirty
what is that
what is that
Guilt by association
may i remind you
yeah you may
you have got an eyewitness
i haven't forgotten
Wallowski is arraigned in the morning
my hands are tied
if she goes to County that is a death sentence
Well she either gives up her partner or she is on her own
Thanks for your help
oh you wanted me to lie
i see now
and Mrs Phillips are you comfortable
i saw what i saw
Let's just get on with it shall we
we have a quick video we'd like you to take a look at
and when i turn that off just give us as much detail about it as you can
there were three people
a couple holding hands an old man in a ball cap and a blue car parked
do you know what change blindness is Mrs Phillips
Changed what
Change blindness
we see what we anticipate we are gonna see even if it changes
the brain doesn't react to the change
Right
Like Charles here
this was actually Loker just a minute ago
so you saw Wallowski drop Prince John off but did you look away for any time before the shooting started
i
i think i was brewing coffee
and then when the shooting started you saw the shooter right
who you thought was the same person you saw with Prince John just moments earlier
i was about to bring you that spoon
how did you get me out
Change blindness
what you looking at Flaco
Lovely weather we are having
i am not talking about Farr
Balmy for this time of year
you want me to talk about Farr because you are working with IA right
that is how you got me out of jail
you are working some kind of deal
Right
Well that is that out of the way then
where do we go now
Straight to sex
Look you know he is dirty right
it is not exactly breaking his heart selling you out by the way
what if he was
and i am not saying that he is
is what
Dirty
you just said it
there are two types of dirty
one is who you are and one happens to you
oh Farr is a victim
do me a favor
Wanna know how it happens
how what happens
Corruption
you did it again
i am too tired for this
Well humor me
i bought the wine
so we isolated some of her reactions during the Suarez interrogation
first interview
after a softball from Farr she purses her lips barely noticeable
Five months later she looks away brow furrows much more intense reaction
in an interrogation last year you see disgust around her nose around her mouth
and finally six weeks ago her entire body shifts away from Farr and she leaves the room
so in terms of intensity her disgust with Farr rises from a to E in lockstep with Suarez's crimes
as he went from joyriding to homicide
she is known all along that Suarez and Farr had some kind of deal
Lightman's watched all of these interviews
how could he miss this
Change blindness
that is not bad for 7 bucks eh
you know about wine
it is made from grapes
what do you do when your partner busts a 14 year old with a few grams of heroin
you send them to juvie for a Ph D in Criminology or cut them a break
i do not know
you tell me
you start small
you just fudge some paperwork here and there
Knock a banger around a bit get a shooter out of him
you know that is all very interesting
but not one mention of Detective Farr
i am trying to tell you you get deep enough in you can not get back out
you know two dead bodies is a world away from fudging a bit of paperwork darling
Really
so get on with it then
Candles
Cabinet
Top left of the stove
Sexy music
on it
Lube
Just kidding
you got a light
i am in the mood
yeah
Home invasion 85 North Pershing
i am in the mood i am in the mood
Baby i am in the mood for love
Bloody hell
Untraceable right
my dad said Always have options
i said night time is the right time
to be with the one you love
you know where night come Baby God know
you are so far away
i am in the mood
i am in the mood
i am in the mood for love
yeah
Come back to
Baby i am in the mood for love
Hey
what is that
oh man he is hit
he is down
what is going on
who is next
Get him
you got 10 seconds to get your friend out of here or we are done talking
all right
all right
all right do not shoot
i am in the mood baby
i am in the mood for love
Glad you met me yet
i think it is time to lose those
Baby i am in the move for love
Just saying
how long are you gonna pretend there is nothing going on
oh you wanna talk about this now
the IA leaned on my partner to lean on me to give you up
now i am being disloyal to my partner because you are being loyal to a man who is up to his neck in it
you are saying Dr Foster is wrong about me
Like she is wrong about me sometimes
it comes from a good place
you ever hear of off duty booty
Suarez is Farr's son
i would not do that if i were you mate
you
it raises the blood pressure you know
i mean if you want a get out of jail free pass from the IA you might wanna get it under control mate
all right suit yourself
but it does make your neck blob out a bit you know
oh really
Wallowski
Well you can stick a fork in her and all because she is cooked
you both are
Did you know that someone shot up her house last night
oh first you have heard of it
Well that is a good sign i suppose
you wanna know who it was
it was your boy Suarez
and when i say your boy what i mean is your son
Nineteen years old
Mowing his way through his own gang while you look the other way
you okay
i am good
and so is Suarez
it starts simple
Right
you are just trying to do the right thing like any real dad would
you can not protect him anymore
he tried killing you last night
Choose
Your partner or your son
Detective Farr
Get me Lightman
now
he is not in yet
Well he bends Farr's ear before the hearing Farr comes in and spills
Suarez is his son
he is been in the kid's pocket for years
so you got your dirty cop
Congratulations
Farr's son killed Prince John and Stomper
he knew they were blackmailing Farr
and Wallowski knew it too
she is dirty
i mean eight hour days with Farr for five years
that doesn't sound like proof
Farr takes the heat says Wallowski knows nothing
Lying through his teeth and Lightman put him up to it
oh this is not about Wallowski anymore is it
it is about Lightman
you can choose Wallowski or your partner
because i will bring down this whole circus act if i have to
Understand
do you need that in writing
her contempt for Farr's choices is getting harder to contain
she knew about Suarez
and you are sure about that
Put her in the cube for long enough and if she is guilty she will betray herself
the muscles in your cheek relax them
no no
Hands down
if you cover your mouth you give yourself away
you know if you teach me how to lie you might never be able to trust me
all right
Pay attention
Focus on what we are doing
you are not helping me
you are just trying to save yourself now
that was good
you hid the contempt
there are four key emotions displayed here
Disappointment frustration disgust outrage
and just like contempt any of these would expose Wallowski's role in covering up Farr's crimes
and you can show me what to look for
and what to ask
Ask her a question she doesn't expect
that is where you will find unfiltered emotion something she won't be able to hide
you knew there was a relationship between Farr and Suarez
they were friendly
Part of our work with Gang Unit is to connect with these kids
but i had no idea until yesterday they were father and son
oh that is good
Nice
Lying comes naturally to you
Good teacher
Just part your lips a little for surprise you know
they will be looking for that
i do not know if i can do this
of course you can
i can not lose the one cop i can squeeze on the street
Tell me a lie
anything you like
i hate you
now that is brilliant
you are ready
you knew Detective Farr had a relationship with Marco Suarez
we are meant to form relationships with street level dealers
Did you know he was helping Suarez
no
i did not know anything about that
but you do know that he beat Prince John to cover his relationship with Suarez to support Suarez's move to control the 9 6s
now that he has confessed sure i guess
is Detective Farr a good father to his children
which ones
to his regular family ones
you mean his white ones
do not deflect the question detective
i am sorry
what was the question again
oh yeah

Dr Lightman

ANNOUNCER
you are listening to Jim Dawkins in the Morning
DAVE
Wake up Washington
this is Dave sitting in for Jim Dawkins
we got a lot on the topic today
so why do not you get your phones ready and give us a call
they say that Washingtonians are apathetic and various broadcasts overlap then fade out
 
 
ESTES
last night at 2300 GMT one of our ground assets produced a live lead on an enemy operating base in the Korengal Valley
Nice of you to join us Carrie
how is it you are the only analyst in this section that can not get to a briefing on time
i wanted the whole group to hear this
within the hour
Delta Team was on site where they identified multiple insurgents on our hit list
Minutes later two UH 60 Blackhawk gunships
lit the target with over 8 000 rounds
all 13 hostiles were confirmed kills
but during the sweep one of the deltas found something else a padlocked door to an interior room
i wanted you to see for yourselves
Get the fuck down
Get him on his feet
man speaking Arabic
what did you say
raspy
i am an American
analysts gasp murmur
Turns out he is one of ours
Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody
MlA since early 2003 and presumed dead until now
CARRlE
what happened to his partner
Brody was a scout sniper
they work in pairs
Corporal Thomas Walker also went missing that day
According to Sergeant Brody
Walker was killed during their captivity
but that should not dampen what is a major win for the agency and for everyone in this room
you should all take a moment give yourselves a big hand
because of you an American hero is coming home
Good job
what were his exact words please
CARRlE
an American prisoner of war has been turned
he said this in English
yes
he whispered it into my ear right before the guards pulled me away
and when he used the expression turned
he meant turned working for Abu Nazir
Why am i just hearing about this now
because until ten minutes ago
i did not know there were any P O W' s still alive in Iraq or Afghanistan
so you are suggesting that Abu Nazir men conversing indistinctly conversation fades
you are suggesting that Abu Nazir planted intelligence in his own safe house just so we could recover Sergeant Brody
i realize it sounds like a reach
to say the least
Why not just drop him near a checkpoint and make it look like he escaped
Why would you sacrifice 13 trained fighters
because Abu Nazir is playing the long game
this way no one suspects a thing
Except you
yeah except me
yeah
and Sergeant Brody's due home from Germany tomorrow morning which gives us just under 22 hours
to do what
to authorize a surveillance package
to tap his phones wire his house follow him wherever he goes
David will never sign off on that and you know it
of course he won't
the White House needs a poster boy for the war and David just served him up on a platter
that is why i am coming to you
i am not going over his head not on a hunch
but if i am right if he is a terrorist we need eyes and ears on Brody from the minute he steps off the plane
never happen
but
Out of the question
Carrie
all right fine
what do i have to do
sighs heavily
Prove that the safe house leak was planted
or at least give me a reason to doubt its authenticity
i am in the penalty box Saul
i am 5 000 miles away from my contacts
i can not collect intelligence from behind a desk
Find a way
no do not look at me that way
we are all fighting the same enemy here
jet aircraft taking off
we are ready for you Sergeant Brody

REPORTER
the turnout is overwhelming here at Andrews Air Force Base where Sergeant Nicholas Brody is scheduled to land in just under two hours
now a White House spokesman confirms that the Vice President will be on hand
do you even remember him
not really
as we reported Sergeant Brody is one of two marines who went missing in action eight years ago during a mission into Iraq near the Syrian border
a former marine scout sniper Sergeant Brody was operating in hostile territory when his spotter
hi Brody
the soldiers were then separated
you coming or not Mom
' Cause i do not think it'd appropriate if we were late
yeah let me just get my coat

but after the announcement that Sergeant Brody in fact survived the eight year ordeal and was greeted by a wave of enthusiasm from an American public eager to greet a true hero
more details on Sergeant Brody's captivity are expected to come out over the coming days but a military spokesman

Did a number pop up on a tracer

no not without a subpoena
Look Virgil if somebody's trying to make contact with Brody it will only happen once
and when it does we will be there
all right
it is all good
Relax
all right
i have got to get dressed
ESTES
many of the men and women in this room are involved in the operation which resulted in your rescue so we take an extra measure of pride in welcoming you
Thank you sir
now we have all read your debrief from Germany so today we just have a few more questions clarifications really that might help us in our ongoing fight against Al Qaeda
i understand
Good
Good
we will uh start with Stuart Strickland
lead analyst in our Iraq section
STRlCKLAND
Sergeant Brody it is a pleasure
a few weeks after your capture Special Forces conducted a direct action mission against a former police HQ in Garma
WOMAN
According to your debrief most of your incarceration was spent at a secret military facility outside Damascus
what landmarks or structural details can you give us to help pinpoint
Eight months you were smuggled overland to an enemy operating base in Afghanistan
now after so many years what prompted
Sergeant Brody my name is Carrie Mathison
i served as a case officer in Iraq
Your picture was on our MlA wall
i saw it every day for five years
it is good to meet you in person
Thank you ma'am
i am sorry we were unable to find you sooner
i appreciate that
I'd like to start with the first few days of your captivity if you do not mind
not at all
how soon after you were taken did the interrogations begin
Pretty much right away
what did they want to know
anything i could tell'em about U S ground operations supply routes communication codes rules of engagement
when you were debriefed in Germany you said you gave up no such information
my SERE training was excellent
and Corporal Walker
Ma'am
Did he give anything up
we were never interrogated together so i do not know
but still you must have wondered especially after you learned of his death
i am assuming there is a point to all this Carrie
there is sir
as you know the first 72 hours after a soldier's capture are critical
what he knows can be used by the enemy during that period to devastating effect
the point is Sergeant Brody stopped being a source of actionable intelligence fairly quickly and yet he was kept alive for eight more years
I'd like to ask him if he knows why
i often wondered that myself
who was your interrogator
an Al Qaeda commander
his name was Zayadi
Zayadi
that is what he told me his name was anyway
was this him
no
but you know who this man is
of course
every marine in country was briefed on high value targets
Did you ever meet him
Abu Nazir
was he ever present during any of your interrogations
no
Look again
man speaks Farsi
Sergeant Brody
no i never met him
what what what about Walker
Did he ever mention Abu Nazir
no
you sure
Carrie how many times does the man have to answer the question
it is just i am just a little surprised sir
Abu Nazir was in charge of coordinating attacks against coalition forces at the time
no one had more reason to sit down with the only two American P O W' s in his custody
Well apparently he did not
is there anything else Carrie
no sir that is it
Thank you Sergeant Brody
Thank you
Moving on Sergeant Brody
I'd like to turn your attention to anything you may have witnessed or overheard when in captivity
CHRlS
Remember Mrs Base
DANA
the math teacher
yeah
yeah she was like my least favorite teacher of all time
she is so annoying
Hey can you guys come in here a second
Hey i need help getting ready for tonight
what is tonight
some of your father's buddies from Bravo Company are coming over for a barbecue
there is a bag of corn that needs to be shucked and the grill needs to be cleaned
i will do the corn
so do i have to be here
Why is everything always a problem with you
i was just asking a question
i know things haven't been easy between you and me
but we all have to find a way to be there for each other now okay
phone ringing yeah okay
Clean the grill
hello
BRODY
Hey Jess
Hey
how did it go
i am actually still here at Langley
i am stuck in this debrief and it is taking a little longer than i expected
how much longer
oh only an hour or two maybe
Well do not forget everybody's coming at 5 00
BRODY
Sure
i won't be late
okay
Bye honey
Sergeant Brody you are a man who is endured a terrible ordeal
BRODY
Thank you Mr Vice President
phone buzzes
anything
as a matter of fact yeah
Brody just lied to his wife
Tell me
VlRGlL
Max is tailing his town car
Brody just said he was still at Langley but he told his driver to drop him off at Bluemont Park
this is it
he is making contact
all right i will meet you there
where is where is Bluemont Park
elevator bell dings
Saul
Hey
Late for a meeting off campus
how many boards can one man sit on
you kissed Carrie Mathison into my debrief this morning
i am curious if that was her request or yours
hers
Frankly i am surprised you did not assign her yourself since she is the only one in the section who is ever been to Iraq
it is not her resume i have a problem with
it is her temperament
what happened
she turned a routine follow up into a cross examination
Kept trying to connect Brody to Abu Nazir
it is always Nazir with her
i won't deny she can be a little obsessive on the subject
is there something i should know Saul
not that i am aware of
because the last time
i heard her like this she bribed her way into an Iraqi prison caused an international crisis
i appreciate your concern
Carrie has learned her lesson
and we both know how good she is
what did i tell you when i agreed to give her one more chance
you said only if i agreed to do the babysitting
i said it would end badly
for both of you
you have got a big blind spot where she is concerned
Trust me
i did too
now my wife lives in Palm Beach and i only see my kids twice a year
ducks squawking
ducks quacking
indistinct chatter
Did you fix the audio
Well we will know soon enough
i set up a directional mic near the band shell
Max switch to channel three
Somebody's approaching Brody from 1 00 a female dark red coat
sniffles
static crackling whining
WOMAN
i did not think you'd be able to make it
i do not understand why you had to go through Mike
Why did not you just call me yourself
i did
twice
are you recording this
WOMAN
but your wife answered
she did not give me any messages
WOMAN
because i hung up
she hates me Brody
Hates you
Why
because i got remarried
Jessica reacted like it was a personal insult
Like i was publicly giving up hope that you and Tom were still alive
what the
who the hell is she
Helen Walker
it is the wife of the other missing marine
Ah well then she is not Brody's contact
Just keep listening
annoyed sigh
HELEN
the Pentagon said you both were dead
and now they are refusing to give me any information about what happened to Tom
what do you want to know
how he died
he is gone
does it really matter how it happened
it does to me
he was beaten to death
were you there
grunting
no
Thank you for telling me
i am going home
Want to be there in time for this barbecue
Hold on a second
Max will you give us a minute
Max step out of the van
i did not think that this was any of my business
now i am thinking that it is
Clozapine
i am sorry
was i supposed to say something
Just tell me i am not out here risking federal prison on behalf of a crazy person
i am crazy
it is not funny
if anybody at the Agency finds out about this
i have got a mood disorder okay
i looked it up Carrie
Clozapine's an anti psychotic
i am dealing with it
i have i have been dealing with it since i was 22
does Saul know
laughing
God no
no
Nobody does
do not act so shocked
i mean it can not come as a complete surprise
you know i love you Carrie but i got to be honest
None of this is making me feel any better
what are you saying
that i am making this shit up
Well maybe i am you know maybe it is all in my head but you are in it now Virgil up to your fucking neck and so is your weird little brother so do not even think about bailing on me
you think for one minute you get away with this
i thought that once i had some proof
do you have any
sighs
anything
Even suggesting that Sergeant Brody's what you think he is
no
then get a lawyer
' Cause you are gonna need one when you report to the IG first thing in the morning
Saul please
there is not anything to say
i i am just making sure we do not get hit again
Well i am glad someone's looking out for the country Carrie
i am serious
i missed something once before
i won't
i can not let that happen again
it was ten years ago
everyone missed something that day
yeah everyone's not me
i understand that
i doubt a grand jury will
Come on you recruited me Saul
you trained me
you put me in the field
Tell me what i can do to make this right between us
whispers

Come on you can not be all that bad
chuckles

Four of my men have disappeared two on a fishing trip two in town

Rubbish
Blackbeard Island is owned by Professor Sanborn
Why should he blackmaiI a nobody Iike Taylor
it is a good question
Why do not we go take a Iook
Impossible
Professor Sanborn is a man of impeccable character
i would require a warrant from the governor to search the place and he would be outraged at such a suggestion
would he
he certainly would Captain
Please remember you people are guests here

These slime buckets have dug themselves in this thing together

OK come on in
gristly crunch
he screams
whistles

Thank you Toto

Three bucks
who is he
my friend Toto
i am Joe Armstrong
i am Alicia Sanborn
what do you want from me
i need to get to Blackbeard Island
WeIl then turn round
you are going the wrong way
Make for Point Piper
a friend of mine's got a boat there
Hey Joe
Alicia Look out
you son of a bitch
Joe
Armstrong Jump
Go Toto
Jump
screams
it is not that far from here
we can walk
Come
i need you to do me a favour
this is very important
TeII Sergeant Jackson that we are going to Blackbeard Island
Five bucks
I'II pay you Iater
Come on
Let's go
it should be here
there it is
we can use this one
the island's about 20 miles from here
Let's go
Wait
we can not go now
they have got patrols
We'II have to wait untiI it is dark
he is escaped Leo
the man's inhuman
we gotta get back to the island
we got some business to finish
now Iook i want you to caII that American ambassador and you teII him to get some Ieashes on his men or he is gonna find himself in the middle of World War ill
Armstrong so what about the Lion
one of the most powerfuI drug dealers in the world
Everybody knows it
and your father
my mother died of cancer and my father's a scientist
after she died he clung to this dream
he was going to find a cure for cancer
he sold everything bought the island and set up a research Iaboratory
he worked hard
the British and American governments invested money
everything was going so weIl
Dad was on the verge of a big breakthrough and
WeIl they simply withdrew
Dad was devastated
i was away at schooI at that time
when Dad caIled me
anyway then the Lion turned up and he offered Dad money Iots enough to finish his project
Dad jumped at the chance did not ask questions
he was so close to finding his cure
the Lion had other ideas and instead of finding his cure for cancer
Dad ended up producing these attacking monsters these ninjas
Producing
something to do with biologicaI engineering
Reorganising a person's genetic code
they used those marines for their experiments
and you
where do you fit into aII this
Bait
as Iong as they have got me they can blackmaiI my father
if they harm me he'II stop working for them
they won't Iet me near him though in case i try to influence him
i guess we'd better see what we can do about it huh
Come on Iet's go
the ambassador won't give us permission to go in untiI he hears from Washington
That'II take another year
what are we going to do
Apparently the governor won't Iet us visit the island
Wild Bill we got a tricky politicaI situation
we got politicaI red tape Captain
you heard Toto
Joe and Alicia are stuck in that island
They'II have to improvise tiII we get the go ahead
i am sorry but that is not good enough
Years ago we started out on the streets
Iow down and dirty
we soon realised to have it aIl to reaIly naiI it down we had to controI the source
so we moved out into the jungles
we took over the plantations and factories untiI we built the biggest drug empire the world has ever known
but success brings jealousy and we Iaid out miIlions with pay offs but the greed only grew
so you came to me and you asked me to find a foolproof way to protect ourselves and our investment
so with the help of Professor Sanborn here
i think i have achieved that objective
so there you are the super ninja the ultimate fighting machine
Strong obedient heartless and as many of them as we want
Enjoy yourselves now and Iet's see what they can do
it is this way
Come on
this is it
where do they make these things
at the far end of the complex
it is on the third floor
whispers Wait here
Ninja Ssh
what is the matter
how d'you make them Leo
what are they
Miracles of genetic engineering
Professor Sanborn wiII show us how it is done
Right Professor
if we wait for the ambassador it is gonna be too Iate
Watch your mouth
ChiII out motor mouth
this unit's Iost five marines
do you wanna Iose Joe and the girl
no i thought not
i am boogieing baby
anyone coming with me
Alicia this is it
gasps it is my father
he Iooks sick
Gentlemen this is it
Professor we are aII ears
These flasks contain frozen ceIls in a solution of amino acids
what are those men doing
Microinjecting DNA hereditary information into a single ceIl
by this method we can controI the building blocks of Iife
we can make the human being anything we want it to be
he keeps most of what is Ieft of his human inteIligence but his knowledge of attack and survivaI
he wiII be cunning inteIligent and devious Iike a predatory tiger
he wiII feeI no pain and know no emotion but hate
his muscles and sinews wiII be replaced with the strongest Iightest high tensile steeI known to man
he wiII run faster than the finest Olympic athlete be stronger than a ten ton crane
and in this next generation you wiII witness the most IethaI assassin the world has ever known
and the best part he wiII foIlow my every order to the Ietter
Right Professor
i think the professor needs his vitamins
Take him away
and now gentlemen for another treat
i am going to show you something that you never dreamed possible
Dad
Alicia
i thought I'd Iost you for ever
it is aII right
there is no time to Iose
the Lion is shipping five biIlion doIlars' worth of heroin to the US tomorrow
if that gets through nothing wiII stop him
where are the marines
in the basement
CeII block a
Alicia take your father to the boat
if i am not back in an hour Ieave
Go
These symbols will focus the ultimate power of purpose

Demonstrative evidence
like Freck skipping out on the Clippers game
Court side seats
who does that
Right
and motive
you killed your roommate thinking he was having sex with your fiance then stuffed his body in your trunk and buried him in the Angeles forest
she is kind of scary
but hot right
yeah very hot
Mostly kind of busy
you are in trouble
she doesn't believe me
you are right
it is hard for me to believe that to keep you from marrying his old girlfriend
Freck's willing to send you to prison for murder and then go into hiding for the rest of his life
Well Freck is a trust fund kid
he can afford the infrastructure to survive
Man Freck has raised the bar on this one
there is no way i could top this
no forget about pranking for a sec
Did it occur to anyone that someone else may have killed him
he did piss a lot of people off
that is why i got out of pranking
Nancy said she would not marry me unless i quit
how are you gonna defend this
all the evidence points to Robbie but
Prosecution doesn't have a body
so highlight Freck's prank history and that he'd do anything to keep Nancy from marrying this guy
okay
but color inside the lines
Did she say something
Nope
so how did you and Nancy hook up
Freck introduced me to her at an S C Tailgate 10 years after they broke up
but how do you not fall in love with someone
Just happens
i do not know
Just like Hailey Moore
all right can we not talk about Hailey Moore
Eighth grade she danced with him once
first of all it was a slow dance a very slow dance
he takes out a page in the yearbook and he writes a poem using the first letter of every word spelling out Hailey Moore
i do not want to talk about Hailey Moore anymore
okay
we need to talk to your fiance though
Alone
Go ahead
Call her
Just
i hate what this is doing to her
we need to also put together a reel of your greatest hits
Nancy's got them all
so in this one prank
Freck had a fake lottery ticket made and gave it to our friend who manages a cigar store
i just won 100 grand
Look at him
he is so happy
you keep that
Keep the change
oh
Whoo
Whoo hoo hoo
Robbie
Nice move
so Freck forged a fake lottery ticket
yes and of course Robbie could not wait to tell me
so he started to text me
oh
oh my
Wow
which almost got him killed
Wow
i told him not to text and walk
you fell in love with these guys
and like you two take life so seriously
Hey
we have grown up
do it again
do it again
do it again
yeah you guys still live together and your fridge is a kegerator
you two have evolved
oh
here we go
Hey
See if we ever invite you to one of our parties again
no do not do that
i may be single
but Nancy why did not you marry Freck
i was just out of college but Freck wanted to settle down
he had no family growing up and he wanted to start one
Freck seemed fine when i started dating Robbie but he changed when we got engaged
Freck is emotionally compulsive
that is code for cuckoo
Nancy we have to ask this because prosecution's gonna ask in court but is there any chance that Robbie was jealous of your relationship with Freck and
Killed him
no
no Robbie would not do this
okay
Fair enough
we will need you to testify and say just that
Name the time and place
Thanks Nancy
all right
if Freck is alive he will know you are Robbie's lawyers
he probably already knows your strengths and weaknesses
Luckily we do not have any weaknesses
that is the garage
Bathroom
Bathroom
Closet
Closet
yeah that is a closet
yeah
all right the grill is lit
she doesn't eat red meat
do we have chicken
we got chicken in the fridge
Relax
she is gonna smell the fear on you
Beverages
Blue moon on ice and juice boxes
Company
Seashells or the seashells
uh seashells
hi
i am Peter
i am Tess
hi Tess
Come on in
and you are
Thirsty
hi
hi
Welcome
Thanks
i have apple slices and raisins juice boxes
we also have Winnie the Pooh on blu ray
no thank you
okay
Well I'd like you to meet some friends of mine
this is Pindar and that is Jared
hi
Up top
Ah i am taller
is he your life partner
he
she is seen you guys take sunset walks along the beach
and Tess it is a little early for uh personal questions
See sometimes Tess grown ups take walks in order to
Excuse me for one sec
hello
Beer
yeah sure
Coming right up
Boba
she is a big Star Wars fan
Well then we will get along great
Hey Pindy
no playing with matches
he burned our last house down to the ground
on purpose
she is adorable
Thank you
Prosecution added another witness
this is a big murder case that we are working on
Ah okay
i will let you guys talk about it
Just a second
Dr McKinney Freck's therapist
Cops talked to her right after Freck disappeared
yeah a therapist can break privilege if their clients are in imminent danger
how bad do you think it is gonna be
According to Dr McKinney's statement to the police she is gonna testify that Freck feared for his life
he said you threatened him
of course he did
i told you Freck played the long game
he says you threatened him with bodily harm if he even so much as looked at your fiance
Come on
Really
Guys does that sound like me
all right Robbie Robbie
if if you and Freck are pranking us
Seriously dude
i can not speak for Freck but i am not
Swear to you this is real
so what are we gonna do
before we can highlight the pranking wars we got to keep that therapist from testifying
Dr McKinney hoped her intimate knowledge of Mr Hildebrandt's personal life might help investigators to find him
therefore Dr McKinney's testimony to police should be admissible
Your Honor first let me just say it is awesome to be in front of a judge who can pull off a goatee like that'cause most can not
i remember i tried it back in the'90s
i looked like my own evil twin
you finished
where does it say that we can not exchange pleasantries
before beginning a respectful discourse
yeah
i do not know
but i was thinking of having a sign made up says just that
Gentlemen i am a busy man
yes Your Honor
Freck was presumed missing at the time so his next of kin holds the right to waive doctor patient privilege
Freck
Mr Hildebrandt's nickname Your Honor
uh yeah the next of kin is Freck's
Mr Hildebrandt's mother
Well your honor Freck's mother
lost touch with him 10 years ago
if in fact she waived privilege we'd like to know how Dr McKinney or the police contacted her
i am sure i can find that out easily enough
Well when you do we would love to call her onto the stand
uh she lives in Belgium
yeah so we will need an interpreter
she only speaks east Flemish
yeah
Ah
all right
the prosecution's request to have Dr McKinney as a witness is approved
Thank you Your Honor
Right after Freck's mother is located and opposing counsel has a chance to question her
Until then gentlemen this train is leaving the station
Thank you Your Honor
and also once again i just
Big big sign
Right over there
yeah
i am starting to see it
so we should go
got it
all right
so this whole operation started with just muffins and cheese sticks
that is why we can not lose the contract with Brockmore
if we are blacklisted there our name will be worthless
no one else will sell them
we think a simple legal demand letter to Brockmore explaining that their anticipatory breach of the agreement should really
Did you go to law school
University of San Quentin
Hey
some guys worked out
i read
anyway they stopped all communication with us then immediately the new shaker farms muffins were on the shelves
oh you try spreading jam evenly on those cratered pucks of manure
Shaker must offer more money for their space
Brockmore took their money and pushed us out
yeah but what about this
Brockmore Foods claims you tagged the Culver City store that carries your muffins as a way of endorsing the store to the neighborhood
not true
i bet that tag goes back five years
they are just using that as an excuse
Perhaps but unfortunately article 12 of your deal states
States that it is void if there is signs of any current gang affiliation but we haven't run with the 32's in years
we do not see any of those guys anymore
Well it is very difficult to prove
Hey we found out Brockmore Foods does this crap all the time
they put out expired product go back on their contracts do bait and switch kind of stuff too
Look we can lean on their lack of communication
Hopefully they will pay off the rest of the contract
no
Man any one of our guys can make more money in a week pumping the streets than you guys make in a year
we are here to prove ourselves legitimately
yes but under the circumstances
i think a payout might be the best deal
Best deal for who
so Danny you are not only aware of Freck's pranks you were once a victim correct
that is right Peter
a couple of years ago me and Freck had lunch
Afterward i had to go to the bank
what i did not notice is that while i was in the bathroom
Freck had gotten into my backpack
Wait you left your stuff alone with Freck
what were you thinking
yeah
there might have been some shots consumed
anyway i give the teller my deposit slip she gets this weird look on her face bends over and hands me a thick envelope
i thought it was my withdrawal
Well i get outside
i am heading to my car
Suddenly there is cops everywhere
oh man
what did Freck do
he put a note into my banking slip saying i had a gun in my backpack and for the teller to hand over 1 000 bucks
Freck
he even put a toy gun and a Nixon mask in there for good measure
Cops were not amused
a Nixon mask
that is a great touch'cause i will tell you
Point Break one of my top five
yeah
i can laugh now
yeah
Your honor are you aware of what is happening right now
Well besides you speaking when a witness is still on the stand
yes Your Honor besides that
Mr Kirk had just been handed photos of his wife in a compromising position with another man
yeah the act is the noun for the Latin verb fellare which means
should i be adjourning
uh no Your Honor because these photos have been digitally manipulated by my partner and i using a laptop
Your Honor it is really good
the bottom one is the best
and see right about now Mr Kirk is being told that the photos are a fake
so we are gonna need to position two bailiffs right about here
yeah in four three two
Think that is funny
you think this is funny
Order
Mr Kirk stand down
little pricks
oh whoa
you gonna let him use that language Your Honor
Your honor he could not even speak Latin and he can say little pricks in court
i am holding you both in contempt
Thank you
Proves our point Your Honor
Jealousy leads to irrational anger
and people will prank one another even if it means risking their own personal freedom
i had fun guys
this was fun Danny
yeah
we are adjourned
the food is very underrated in lockup
the lasagna at county is delicious
Bologna melt at wayside
Three stars at least
i tell you we should start a zagat guide for jail food
Trademark it
Hey
how is everything going at Fresh Slice
you need anything
we like those guys
Well if you liked them you would not have dumped them on me
Well we had a friend who was being charged with murder so we had to prioritize
and again we are asking if you need anything so we do care
Well yes i do actually
Perhaps you could tell the boys in the hood to keep it real and listen to their lawyer and not mad dog me every time that i give them premium legal advice at 50 a word
Word
we are not gonna do that
' Cause maybe you are not giving them primo legal advice and maybe it is because you are scared of Brockmore
you smell
Good
no
okay
you know some of us can actually win cases without going to jail
some of us but not you
Please it is you actually you smell awful
i think i am gonna throw up
no here
Just take my 27 year old scotch and get out of here
Go
all right
Thanks
okay
Well if you need anything
Well if i need anything i will follow you by just using this
are you looking for buried treasure
Actually i am looking for buried health hazards
like beer caps shrapnel disposed hypodermic needles
Maybe gold
oh there is something right here
something no wait
no you are not wearing gloves
you will cut your finger off
do you know how many heroin addicts just
Whoa
it is a Canadian loonie
that is worth 92 American cents
i can sterilize that
can i have it
what
no
i have the equipment
you just dug your hand
Sure
you can have it
Thank you
Thank you
Hey
they are saying online that after yesterday we have made this a dogfight
Odds for acquittal were 15 to 1
now they are 3 to 1
Why are you sitting on the floor
you can relate better to a child if you get on their level
that is why they invented
Indian style seating in kindergarten
Pretty sure the Indians invented that for sitting
Tess
Pindar found a loonie for me
oh Pindy's the best is not he
he is great
you ready for our guitar lesson
so i am gonna teach you an a chord
this is an a chord
that is the open a chord
Right
the barre a chord is way better
the ba
W where'd you learn that
Mom's old boyfriend taught me
we went out
i would not say he was my boyfriend
oh yeah
what is his name
Richie Sambora
Tess
what
Bon Jovi Crocodile Dundee hat on a steel horse he rides Richie Sambora
you know Peter does a pretty good rendition of Bed of Roses if you get him drunk
some say better than the original
Nobody says that
can i get up
Sure honey
Richie Sambora
that is that is awesome
it did not work out
you are getting killed on every front with Charlie
i am not
Pindar is crushing you
who is Pindar
yes
no
what is this
i come in peace
who are you
hello Pindar
it is been way too long
Freck
the reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated
what
Freck
Freck
Freck
i saw his eyes
i looked right into them
it was Freck
i told you he was alive
what else was he wearing
a speedo
that is a brave man to get out of the ocean wearing a speedo
Freck fears nothing
that is why he is Freck
so what are we gonna do
are we gonna we gonna call the cops
Pindy
Pindy
Pindy
huh
you sure it was this guy
yeah
i could be surer if he had his name tattooed on his forehead which he did
W what
he had Freck tattooed on his forehead
Pindy Freck has no tattoos
okay wait a minute
how close were you Pindy
he walked right up to me and he took off his diving helmet and he says
the reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated
Pindy are you high
what
okay i am on 72 different prescribed medications but i know what i saw okay
Look Pindy is a lot of things claustrophobic agoraphobic neurotic with Epstein Barr and irritable bowel syndrome but he is not a liar
Thank you Jared
Hey hey
got a second
not really
Great
i need you back on Fresh Slice
it is very difficult to prove that rehabbed gang members are no longer in a gang
We'd love to but we got a break in our murder case
Well obviously i am the only one who cares about people
Damien
Whoa careful
it could be a Replicant
now
Steady
Hold still
huh
Dilation of the pupils appear normal
Let him go
Continue
Proceed Damien
Brockmore has made screwing people corporate policy
they send out these discount coupons with gotcha fine print and they have got vendor contracts with trap doors so Brockmore can get out at the last minute
and the guys at Fresh Slice they are just trying to turn their lives around
is this really about helping the little guy
do you want us to get our hands dirty so you do not have to
both
Look
Greg Harrell the counsel at Fresh Slice is a Mason
and so is a member of the judicial selection committee
they talk
Mason
so they are tight right
Like in Da Vinci code
it is real
you afraid of the albino
i need your help please
i need your h
i need your help please
what did he say
Michael Phelps
i need your help please
i do not know
and he likes
Just give me some damn help
okay
Fine
Easy
Geez
Negative cyborg
then let's put him on the stand
he is our only eyewitness
our eyewitness is a lawyer for the defense
the prosecution will hammer us
yeah let's listen to Pindar's testimony out loud
i saw a man rise from the ocean wearing a Jules Verne diving helmet speedo and the name'Freck' tattooed on his forehead
Quoting Mark Twain
we will look desperate and crazy
on top of that it is Pindy
i do not know this Pindy
oh he is a lovely human being
one of the most decent
lucid men i think i have ever known
anyway
we got to stop being reactive and start being proactive
we have to think like Freck and bring the war to him
Like you did in court
Like what we did in court
Exactly
Why did Freck show his face this way
Why does the arsonist return to where he set the fire
to watch it burn
Freck knows we scored points by blocking the therapist's testimony and the prank we pulled on the D a that made our point with the jury
Suddenly we have made this a horse race
so he reveals himself to our weakest link hoping that we put Pindy on the stand and he has a meltdown of an eyewitness account
an eyewitness is an eyewitness
we can not beat Freck with this kind of caveman lawyering
Quit making this guy out to be Keyser Soze
he is a punk
Look
Pindar's sanity aside
i
i agree with the boys on this one
it is just too risky to put him on the stand
so stay the course
all right
Thanks
Well do not thank me
Just get it right
oh you are smooth
yeah well you won't come inside so i have to work with what i have got
i have to get the sitter home
okay
i will walk you home
I'd like that
you know i am i am curious um how long was it before Richie met Tess
Really
you are gonna ask me about that now
you have already met Tess
as a neighbor
i
i
i just want like a marker or something when you want to start taking this seriously
' cause then i will know when to bail
i do not think there is a rule book or a timeline
every situation is different
Ah situation okay
okay
yeah that works for me
Whatever this is i like it
i like it too
i just got out of a relationship not too long ago so you know i do not want to rush into anything
oh really
Define uh rushing
Really
you want to talk about that now
Richie Sambora
Please
yeah what does he got
Rock star status platinum records private jet pfft
Surprised the guy's not a virgin
oh
it is Pindy
Hey Pindy what is up
Did you get the e mail i sent you
Pindy if it is another photo of fat people bowling
i am gonna come through the phone
Surveillance footage
Shared discovery from the prosecution
so you bought a shovel rope and tarp
where did they get this
it was sent anonymously to the prosecution
Freck
is what we are saying
so what is so bad about it
Well the prosecution's saying that you killed Freck and buried the body
no no
i
i bought that shovel and tarp to bury a pig
we were gonna throw a luau for Nancy's birthday
what
a luau
yeah
Dude that is crazy
you can not piggyback a birthday party onto a theme party
yeah it is either a casino night or Margarita Monday or a birthday party
no mixing
that is a rookie move
it was Freck's idea
okay it is okay'cause Nancy can back us up
she knew about the luau right
what luau
it was a surprise party
she did not know about it because i was arrested before we had a chance to throw it
okay a surprise luau birthday party
Right
Stick to pranking
Freck told me to buy that shovel and that tarp
he knew a police investigation would bring this stuff out
he is kind of awesome
yeah he should be terrorizing Gotham
Guys
i am on trial for murder here
Look who just realized this is not a joke
okay look none of the items you purchased have shown up on any evidentiary reports
which means they do not have it
which means if you can find those items it goes towards proving you did not ditch evidence
they are in the garage
i swear this stuff is here
i am sure the police already looked
this is why the items weren't on the evidence report
you weren't a little suspicious when Freck wanted to throw a surprise luau party
i am sorry Nancy
i do not blame you for not wanting to marry me but i did not kill Freck
you do not want to marry me do you
i
i do not know
uh conjugal sex is not exactly on my bucket list
uh should we step outside
no
this is exactly what Freck wants you know that
he wants to blow us up
if you do not marry me Freck will have won
is that what you want
i do not care who wins
this is not about winning
i am sorry Robbie
i love you
i think you are innocent but i did not sign up for this
i am not having a prison wedding
Well what about having the wedding before he is sentenced
you mean i am gonna say i am guilty
Sort of
yeah
Freck is competitive and compulsive right
Right
but i bet he loves Nancy more than he hates Robbie
you said he is trying to blow you guys up
what would happen if you guys got married
He'd explode
You'd see the fireball on earth from deep space
there is a way to bring Freck back from the dead
how
by giving up
yeah
we want to throw in the towel
we want to cop a plea
that is your version of being proactive and thinking like Freck
yep
if you want to crash and burn
if that is a yes we will take it
Great
25 years second degree
uh huh
can Robbie take us to the body
Ah he says he dumped it in the ocean
but he stole a skiff and he will put it all in the written confession
Well what happened to
Freck is alive and crawled out of the ocean
Word around town is you guys have a witness who saw him
Pindar
yeah turns out he mixed Ativan with sake
i ever meet Pindar i will punch him out
W we told you the photos are not real
he is never met your wife
Still the images are seared in my brain
we are sorry
Go ahead and just punch us
by us i mean him
you got to admit though it was pretty funny
Pindar and your wife
Mean mugging
one more thing
Conjugal visits
Robbie's not married
two more things
we also want the judge who sentences Robbie to officiate the wedding
are you out of your mind
Judge will never go for that
okay well we will just call this whole thing off you take your chance with the jury
with no murder weapon and no body but ah you will be fine
yeah
i will make it work
okay
Well if you excuse us we have a wedding to plan
Good work Pindy
this really has to get media traction
i have sent the link to TMZ
there you go
Hey what does one wear to a wedding prison sentencing
i do not know
uh business attire
Well the appropriate attire for a day wedding would be a morning suit unless the groom is wearing the same
Go with that
Jared the
i bet mine still fits
do not get me wrong i like her
but she is no Mrs Smucker's
Betty Crocker give me a slice of that
Hey hey
Right there in the kitchen
Sure
they are both nice but you know which one i like
the Quaker Oats lady eh
Quaker Oats lady
yeah yeah
you know that is a that is a
she got the hat
Gentlemen
that is actually a
a what
Gentlemen
can we start
yeah uh you guys have no proof that our clients had anything to do with the tagging
you are using the tagging as an excuse to sell shaker farms
Excuse me
Gentlemen let's work this out amicably
Tagging our store was a hostile act not an amicable one Mr Karp
all right then
you want a street fight
what is going on
Did you leave your balls in the glove compartment
i probably should go get them
in California a criminal street gang is defined as an ongoing organization of a group of three or more persons whether formal or informal that commits crimes as one of its primary activities
we are familiar with the legal definition of a gang
you were sued in 2009 by Manchester Doughnuts for contract violation and in 2013 part of a class action for false advertising
you also have a common name and an identifying symbol
it is another part of the California code
and there are five six board members
which means by legal definition
you are the gang
not Fresh Slice
are you out of your mind
this meeting is over
a actually Greg gang charges are criminal which would lead to a grand jury investigation
i am sure they'd love to hear how Brockmore Foods goes after a charity that helps men and women put their lives back together
those allegations would have to be brought by a district attorney
no D a in this town would touch these charges
Nice try
Being a judge is overrated
you did good Karp
yeah
God knows you need the karma
and eligible for parole in the year 2038
is there anything you'd like to say to the family of the deceased
Well uh Freck really doesn't have any family unless you count his mom who sent me a nice thank you note
but i
i am truly sorry for what i did because
i could use a best man
that it
Pretty much
okay then
the second part of today's hearing
you sure this is gonna work
we try not to be sure about anything
we support their decision
what does that even mean
to commit themselves to each other we are never surprised
for the rest of their lives which is an honorable estate not to be entered into lightly but reverently
that being said do you Mr Ambriano
i
i am sorry
what happened to the if anyone here feels these two should not be wed let them speak now or forever hold your peace
we do not do that in California
Really
yeah
oh
Sorry
Go on
okay
Thanks
do you Robbie Ambriano take Nancy Denuff for your lawfully wedded wife
i do
and do you Nancy Denuff take Mr Ambriano for your lawfully wedded husband
i do
not
Sorry
what
i do not take you as my husband
i
i can not marry you knowing what you did
i can not marry you because i still love Freck
i am sorry
oh that was unexpected
no i knew it
i knew it
you knew it
yeah
Hey uh fellas you still want me to mention the uh refreshments down the hall
i would not
yeah
okay
Bailiff
Lock him up
Congratulations
you look great in blue Robbie
yeah
it is always darkest before the dawn
Robbie Ambriano has pleaded guilty to murder
and shockingly his would be bride Nancy Denuff has professed her love for Freck Hildebrandt
the man ambriano has confessed to killing
Hey baby
Freck
i told everyone the reports of my death were greatly exaggerated
you did all this for me
no i just wanted to break you two up
live on the down low
i would have come forward in a couple of years but then when you said you loved me
i just could not let you suffer any longer
Let's get out of here
not the face
Ohh that was a ginger slap
you are a monster
you bastards
Detectives may i present Roderick Freckles Hildebrandt
it is a pleasure to meet the legend
Cuff him
Sorry Freck
but i am flattered
do not be too mad
he looks mad
a little bit
Best case you will be charged with a false emergency
but we are hoping for worst case
you do not want to get in the cage with me boys
is that a threat
you want a piece of this
i think you should uh leave that alone
Come on
Let's go
Fella's sharp
yeah you better walk away
all right guys
Get the freck out of here
Really frecked him up
so uh you are free tonight i am guessing
yeah
Let's go to your place
i do
Please take a seat
Unfortunately Harrell was right
no district attorney in Beverly Hills would take this case on
but fortunately for muffin lovers everywhere
Brockmore opened a new store in Lynwood
that happens to be the home of the newly elected district attorney who is willing to fight for people of all walks of life
yeah Brockmore caved immediately when he agreed to spearhead a grand jury investigation into their practices
now here is the new contract with Brockmore Foods
i think it is most agreeable in the opinion of your counsel
Thank you
anything you need
yeah man
you have our card
Actually c could i get a picture with you guys
yeah
Totally
Cool
Great
all right
yeah okay
everyone in there
okay
on three
one two three
Well this life ain't half bad
no
Well if we ever get married we can do it like Stanton marry four times keep it fresh
not me man
i am like an emperor penguin
Mate for life
you are like an emperor penguin
or the schistosoma mansoni worm
the mansoni worm reproduces within the human body and forms loyal monogamous pair bonds
Stuff of Shakespeare
Well except when it causes snail fever which triggers vomiting and fever and uncontrollable defecation
you get that
Sorry
what is up guys
what is going on
um more guests are arriving

Always with the mother jokes
my mother is a Saint and you would be lucky to
Talking to Tess
Sorry

she needs to be alone with Billy
Billy
Billy

Congrats
i was looking forward to those conjugal visits
i have no problem with that
we can still role play
do you have a sister
who is Billy
what are you doing
uh we have a boss who wanted us to finish a lot of work but we are done
who is Billy
my mom says you ask a lot of questions
i am a lawyer
it is my job

Fair enough
one last question

Pindy she sees you as a baby brother
Hey Tess
how would you like to keep Boba
because Pindy just whispered in my ear and he would like you to keep Boba
Really
Aww are you sure Pindar
yeah
uh you know what
on second thought Boba doesn't travel well plus you know his wife Sintas Vel is gonna be so upset if he hangs out with another woman
Remember when i gave you a loonie
that was like 92 American cents
i do not want to give her too much and spoil her
it is for her own good
S so you are saying she is spoiled
Pindy
no
Just that a role model for a girl should not be a bounty hunter
i could get you a Barbie doll
i have one in like a flight attendant outfit
that is just sexist
Wow
a all right you can keep him
okay
we will borrow him
Pindy you are gonna make an amazing father someday
Hey Tess you want to play a game Pindy loves to play called let's bury Boba in the ocean
you know what we should do
we should introduce Boba to our balloon launcher
oh he'd love that
no he no he can not swim
he will sink
Hi's armor's too heavy
Hey
Let's play another game
uh it is called take care of the rare collectible synced and corrected by chamallow www addic7ed comi do not think he wanted to be a star but
i think he'd got this feeling that he'd got something to say to the people of his own generation a feeling that he could make them happier
and he did not feel that he did that
it is great that people have been discovering Nick
Once you discover Nick you are going to tell other people
if you met a girl and you took her back to her room and if there were some Nick Drake records there you would probably want to marry her
i feel a bit of affinity with him
i think if if like Nick makes you think of home
i think that one of his great tragedies
i think he said to someone
i have got no more songs
there were moments when it was very sad working with him
later on
Well i came to Nick Drake's music very late
and he is got some sort of magical quality you know
there is a lot of mysticism no mystique attached to Nick Drake because he only made three records
and not much is known about him there is no film of him
Very little recorded words
but there is still a kind of magic about his music i think
a kind of fragility which a lot of people indentify with
my parents were both wonderful
they had an idyilic early marriage out in Burma
because life was wonderful for colonials at that time
we were very typical i suppose of a certain class
of a middle class
my father as a young man had gone out east and was an engineer
my mother was very much Nick's mother
she was very beautiful and she was very creative
and i think really would have been a troubled soul if it hadn't been for having married my father
my father made living possible for my mother
but he did not destroy her creative ability either
she flourished as a songwriter
we came back to England
Nicky was four
and our very earliest school was together
and i always remember
i remember Nick's first day at school
and i was by that time head girl of this school
and i remember being absolutely beastly to him him running into my class for a bit of comfort
i almost denied the fact that he was my brother
it was something i felt so deeply ashamed of afterwards
i put it him and he'd completely forgotten about it in later years
but i never forgot it
he was captain of various games and things when at his first school and when he went to the next school he became the head boy of his first house
but it did not really seem to mean very much to him
the Headmaster gave him a very good report but said at the end
None of us seem to know him very well
and i think that was it all the way through with Nick
People did not know him very much
Music was very much a part of my life
as i said my mother and my father were both composing songs from my earliest youth
i remember it happening particularly my mother who wrote songs about both of us
from my earliest childhood
i think that Nick was unconsciously very influenced by her
he may be horrified at the time to have heard this
but i am quite certain he was influenced by her whole chord structure and by her way of composing
Perhaps the best way of showing this is to actually play one of her songs
and you can see somewhere the similarity and the influence
i met Nick Drake when i was here in Cambridge and he was up in Fitzwilliam College reading English
there was an element of us feeling slightly superior to other students who were cycling to lectures on their bicycles
we would get up late we would smoke dope we would not go to lectures
i think we felt we were sort of superior
i was the guy who smoked more dope than anybody else and i am the guy who went on to have drug problems later on
but there was this it was really a three year holiday and Nick would go off and just play his guitar
I'd sometimes go and see him up in Fitzwilliam
and he'd be just playing the same riff over and over again
he always made it look effortless
i was always struck by his guitar playing because i would sort of strum Beatles songs or something
he was playing this folky bluesy style
it was always very clean and with great precision and he could repeat it over and over again
and just go on and on for hours playing this amazing riff
with interesting finger picking and stuff
it just amazed me
we never actually did a whole lot
i can read you a bit
i have to say that i am afraid that this letter got eaten by mice
in the drawer where it was kept
so there are bits that are missing but not not too badly
yes here we are
it may surprise you to hear that during the last few weeks
i have been extraordinarily happy with life
and i haven't a clue why
it seems that Cambridge can in fact do nice things to one if one lets it
and i am not sure that i did let it before
i think i have thrown off one or two useless and restrictive complexes
that i picked up before coming here
the work is not too bad at the moment
i am doing seventeenth and eighteenth century poets
People like Swift Pope Blake etc
who have quite a lot to offer in their way
but they seem to be very difficult to write about
must stop now and go to bed
both of us were very keen on him staying at Cambridge
Whatever else you did in life if you managed to get a degree at least you'd have something to fall back on
his replies were that a safety net was the one thing he did not want
so that rather cut the ground from under my feet
he used to look back on Cambridge days with a certain amount of nostalgia
anyway that is another story
we were actually sharing a flat together in London
Until one day Nick came into my room and he was a man of few words my brother
and said
here you are
and he threw onto the bed the complete record of Five Leaves Left
i was absolutely astonished
i could not believe
this is my brother my little brother had produced a full long playing record as it was then
it was amazing
he was great to work with
all you needed to worry about was the other people
because Nick's guitar would always be right
Nick's voice would always be right
Nick was just there and i think
when you listen back to the records one of the things that is most extraordinary is the guitar because
it is so clean and so strong and all the notes are equally balanced
it is very unusual to have such complicated finger picking parts played in such a clear strong way
every note
so that you really can construct the whole recording around the guitar
Nick and i were living in London then
and i think at the Chime of the City Clock
i am just going before the studio not how i worked on it
but very much tried to capture the mood of it and it was bleak lonely wet
October evening trotting around some street in London
there is several songs like that that Nick does
Parasite on Pink Moon
i think it is a similar sort of mood
so we decided to put like counter melodies but no chords
so most of it is another tune to make it lonely and bleak
and basically there is either the fiddles an octave apart or the cellos doing the low line
it is similar on Fruit Tree the way the oboe and the cor anglais are they are all just playing one long tune and one takes off after the other
' Cause i did not want to take over from the guitar playing which is really sort of well you will notice when you hear it it is
it is like a machine i do not want to take the art out of it
' cause it is beautiful and very spiritual but it is all demanding you must not go against the rhythm
' cause Nick's always going to keep that rhythm perfectly
we were looking for a bleak lonely sound and i think
John did it perfectly again
there was the guitar strings and the woodwinds overdub is not it
so here in one track you have the guitar
and that is the rock that the whole thing's built on
that is his voice coming down the guitar microphone
and there is the singing
that is Dave
that is probably Dave playing the guitar
Bass guitar
and that is the drums
what you are hearing now is just the raw product put down
at the time when we sat in the control room it sounded like this
but we would then put a perspective on the sound
for which we'd start using echo
and you can just hear the playing again out there
i thought that it all would be fine
we are gonna send Nick out on the road and it is all gonna be great
and so we sent him out on a tour of colleges and clubs you know
and it did not work at all because of the situation where you have a bar or you have people drinking and talking
he could not get anybody to stop talking
he did not know what to say to them he took a long time tuning his guitar because every song has a different tuning
and eventually he got so discouraged by the fact that people would not shut up
you know he was not like Keith Jarret
he would not stop and say shut up i am not gonna play until you be quiet
and he just called up one day and said
i am coming home
and we cancelled the rest of the dates
and he never really did another show
a friend of mine went to see him and he hammered on the door and there was no reply
so he went round the back of the house and looked through the window and there was Nick
Just looking at the wall
he was just looking at the wall
he did not want to tap on the window and disturb him but
he just left
he said you know he is a really strange guy sometimes
Nick just seemed to become more isolated you'd go and see him and the conversation would become uncomfortable and i would leave
and then he wound up going back to his parents' place where
i think he felt quite embarrassed about that quite ashamed that he hadn't been able to cope in London and pay the rent and do all the stuff that we all have to do and wound up in his parents' place
and he did go into hospital while he was there and he was treated with anti depressant drugs
i do not think the psychiatrist could have done anything else
if you are presented with somebody like this from a privileged background done well at school got to Cambridge what else are you going to diagnose
Doctors think in terms of diagnosis
i see it more as an existential thing that the world was becoming a rather heartless and a rather futile place
Home Again
he said once
i do not like it at home but i can not bear it anywhere else
i think he felt it was a kind of refuge
he had to come back here
he tried many times to go away
often
he used to stay away for several nights
we never knew where he was
we used to ring up his friends and wonder if they'd seen Nick
in case he was in trouble you know
i think he had rejected the world
nothing made him happy
Well i never really did begin to see a change none of us did
it was something that sort of crept up on Nick
and the great difficulty for my parents who were extraordinarily tried so hard you know
as understanding as they could be
they tried to get to grips with his illness and tried to understand it but it was very difficult because they felt that everything they did was wrong
and in a funny way everything everybody did was wrong
but they were much more there and present
he sort of retreated into his home environment
but he so wanted to break away from it and felt separate from it i think
i do not believe that he really felt a part of his home background
but he could not escape from it towards the end
he saw more
and that is expressed in his songs and almost nowhere else
i think he became more silent as he saw more
he said to me once
i have failed in everything i have tried to do
i said
oh Nick how can you and then i
i elaborated all the things he had so patently done
that did not make any difference
he felt that he had failed to get through to the people he wanted to talk to
his mother called me and she said they wanted him to see a psychiatrist
and that he felt people would judge him
but that was a kind of a sign of weakness
Typical English point of view about it
and would i speak to him
so i talked to him and just said nobody's going to think any worse of you for getting help if you need help
it is normal
but he did sound bad
he came to see me looking very bad very dirty etc etc
in a way what he said to me there he had this outburst of anger about everything
Everybody tells me i am great but i am broke
Why
in a way it was a manifestation in the conversation of the lyrics of Hanging on a Star
if you deem me so high why am i so low
what is the story
Why do not i understand it
Everybody says i am a genius
and i do not have any money i do not have a career
it is all a mess
you have to remember that although i saw Nick occasionally socially mainly i saw him when he had an album to work so by the time the last album came out the last one of the three
then he was seriously withdrawn
it was quite dramatic everyone will tell you this
everyone that saw him then will tell you it was a dramatic departure of the Nick that we knew
he did not speak much the odd muttered word
he had quite a down appearance
his sister once said that the pictures down on the house in Heath which was this particular album where the most honest she'd seen
i am not sure i buy that entirely but i know what she means
it did reflect what he was like at that time
you will meet people that tell you he was depressed at other times
i was there at the times the session times and nothing was quite like that final session
Whereas before you bounced ideas and you talked and made things work there he just basically sat or stood and i ran around and eventually
i ran out of things to say
i just clicked
it was like doing a still life
i always say that Nick was born with a skin too few
but i think it is better summed up by a poem that my mother wrote
and it is a poem that is called the Shell
which goes
Living grows round us like a skin
to shut away the outer desolation
for if we clearly mark the furthest deep
we should be dead long years before the grave
but turning around within the homely shell of worry discontent and narrow joy we grow and flourish and rarely see
the outside dark that would confound our eyes
some break the shell
i think that there are those who push their fingers through the brittle walls
and make a hole and through this cruel slit
stare out across the cinders of the world with naked eyes
they look both out and in
Knowing themselves and too much else beside
John Wood and i did the final recording session
he was in such a state that he could not sing and play the guitar at the same time
those last four tracks
Black eyed Dog and all those are recorded with the guitar and then voice singing over the guitar
because he was just too nervous
i do not know how to describe the way he was but it was very agonizing seeing him trying to do those recordings
they were extraordinary recordings but they were the combination the lyric and the music and the state of Nick at the time of doing it was a very distressing experience
he went up to bed rather early
i remember him standing by that door and i said
you off to bed Nick
i can just see him now
Apparently he'd been down he'd been downstairs during the night
i heard some corn flakes or something like that
and he often did that when he could not sleep
more often than not Molly would hear him
Goodness knows how many nights this happened
she would hear him passing our bedroom door and she'd get up put her dressing gown on go down and talk to him
this occasion she did not hear him
but he'd obviously had been down
then he went back and he took this extra strong dose of these pills that had been prescribed for him called Tryptizol which he thought were anti depressants
he told us he was supposed to be taking three a day or something
they were prescribed
you were always worried about Nick being so depressed and when he used to hide away the aspirin and the sleeping pills and things like that
These particular things we did not think were in anyway dangerous
and that was it
the next morning
he often did not get up at all early
he sometimes had very bad nights
and i never used to disturb him at all but it was about
it was about twelve o'clock and i went in
because it seemed it was time he'd got up and he was lying across the bed
the first thing i saw was his long long legs
i was playing in a comedy at the time at the Bristol Old Vic
it was my opening night
i rang my parents after the show which i always did after the first night to tell them how it had gone
and i remember the phone was engaged
it was continually engaged and i thought that it must be out of order or something
of course they'd taken the phone off the hook that was the day Nick had died
and they did not want to tell me over the phone at that precise moment
but what happened was that they drove down to Bristol the next day
but they sent a telegram to say they were coming
and for some extraordinary reason i thought it must be that they were on their way to visit my grandmother
i had no idea why they were coming
None at all
and then they turned up and they told me
and although i had no idea why they were coming
i remember putting my head in my hands and saying
i knew
and of course they thought that Nick had sent me a card or something
it was nothing to do with that
on one level i did not know at all
but on a deep level
i knew
i do not really know for sure whether Nick wanted to take his life
my feeling is that what happened was that he had all these pills it certainly was not premeditated
that he just tipped them out to into his hand and threw them into his mouth and swallowed them and thought
what the hell
Either i die or i live and things will be changed
something different will happen
when you have the very great good fortune to come from a very loving family
the price you have to pay for that good fortune is the death of the people in that family
that is the tragedy which is always there
it changes your life forever
but you grow around it
i was quite shocked actually
People say we must have seen it coming but as i said Nick had always had those spells
but it was a shock
i hadn't heard from him for two or three months
i was just terribly sad
i suppose i was not surprised
but it was it seemed a great loss
for somebody I'd enjoyed working with so much
i am afraid that at this stage my voice began to fail me rather badly
i will just do one more song
of course the only thing that makes sense of his death is his fame that is now coming about
i think above all it is not his fame it is more the fact that a lot of young people have found his music such a help
that i thing would have pleased him so very very much
he once said to my mother
if only i could feel my music had done anything to help one single person
it would have made it worth it

what do you want from me
i did not do anything
Shut the fuck up you little piece of shit
Listen
you are making a big mistake
i have got a wife and two children
their names are Miriam and Benjamin
Stop this psychological shit
i do not give a damn
not even if you had twenty kids
i used to have a child too
his name
his name was
you fucking whore
Take this
Go to hell you son of a bitch
what did you have to suffer my beloved child
Why
Why me
Why did i have to go through all this
is it finally over
it is over
it was very important for you to experience that
Your soul should mature to carry away the collected guilt
i do not understand
Suffering is a solution
if you accept it you will grow with it
if you deny it you will experience the same situation over and over and over again
what do you mean by that
you have taken your test of life
if your life appears perfect to you would you be prepared to face your past
if you have to realize that you are not living your dreams but dreaming your life what would you do to find salvation
Good morning my dear
did not you want to get up at 9 00 am
yes
what time is it
Almost 10 00 am
i fed Nico changed his diapers and cleaned the bathroom
Why did you clean the bathroom
Well changing a diaper was not as easy as i thought
it got a little messy
if the neighbors ask for me tell them i am on a business trip
and when i am back i am going to take care of our new home
no
Just tell them i will write an email
or even better i will send a postcard from the Carribean which says that all of these wiseguys can kiss my ass
Sebastian
it had to be said
Wait
does this mean that i have to do the whole moving and the annoying farewell orgy with the neighbors
do i have this right
you still have Joe and Michael
they will bring some friends and it will all be done before you even know it
Give them some beer and they will be happy
but what about the neighbors
you know what i mean
Come on
Put on your famous Garfield grin
Exactly
Honey i am late

Sooner or later we are all going to die

Maybe
but i know how it is to die
last summer i was drowning in that sea over there
at some point you stop fighting against it
then there was this bright white light
an absolutely amazing trip

he got overwhelmed by greed and made love to me between the sheets
Bitch

okay
okay okay okay
you have to keep calm
you have to make a plan
you can not act from rage
you have to be sure about what you are going to do and how you are going to do it
that is the only way to be successful
i am going to take a relaxing bath now
and then i will go and get Nico even if i have to kick in this old hags door
Fuck

Children are so full of innocence until they grow up
and their mind gets poisoned by our society and our twisted values
the child is already enlightened
he waits for you in the light
he already forgave you
if you have lay a finger on him i swear to God i will kill you
no
what did you do to him
what do you think
who could be interested to do you harm
Please
Please
i will do anything you want
but please do not hurt my child
Please
you did not answer my question
Irina

Look on my computer
the window with the photomontage is still up

Why are you doing this to me
i am here to help you
what you are doing to yourself you are doing by yourself
my help is unconditional
i do not need your help
i was getting along pretty good without your help
Your soul has drifted from the right path and your mind is confused
Your thoughts are so full of opportunism when you are enlightened you are going to realize that you are not standing in your real life
and where do i stand
in your mental dreamworld from which you will never return
Thank you for this dream
that is a fucking nightmare
that one dream certainly is
he will bring you back into your normal life
but you have to understand that you are the one who is doing all of this
the other dream shows the life that you would love to live but never could
i do not want to see those abnormal cruelties anymore
Please understand
it is breaking my heart
Good
we are one little step further
now push key 2
what are you doing with me you hog

the values of symbols can be different in several cultures though there are always combined elements
for example the color white stands in Western cultures for absolute purity and truth
in Eastern cultures it stands for sorrow and death
Back in the antiquity the four temperaments got assigned with colors
Afterwards the color especially found access to the chronography and the heraldry
Blue sky loyalty pureness Maria
Yellow sun eternity but also envy
Green hope immortality
Red love blood and the blood of Christ
Black sorrow
Just one simple question
which of these colors would describe your current feelings
Red
and black
i will guide you to white
and then you have to make your final decision
but you have a long way to go
a very long way
now it is about time for the second layer
LAYER 2 LEVEL GREEN
where am i
you are at the'Torture End Time'
Jennifer someone's waiting for you in the darkroom
Why am i here
and what have you done with my eye
you just see one half and do not want to see the other
now i need to force your way
i am in your inside
my appearance arises from your dark side
Please please please
i can not take this anymore
if you won't give me my child back why do not you kill me right away
Go ahead
what the hell are you waiting for
do it
i did not take your child from you
you took children away
i am trying to get you back to reality
on a physical level there will be a sympathectomy after that
but for that your conscience has to be pure
you want to torture me to death right
you are expecting euthanasia
Basically you have to thank yourself for it
now i want you to start reading chapter two of the book
i won't do shit
you motherfucker mutilated me
i have already told you to kill me
Come on
do it
Mommy
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
i will do anything you want from me
Please forgive me
i did not mean it
but you have to promise me that you won't hurt him okay
okay
okay okay
i will continue reading now
Additive and substractive color mixing
i do not know why i have to read this
what did you learn from reading chapter one
the symbols of various colors
and now
this means that the color of blue red and green in front of a black background appears white
Additive color mixing
the other way around
the color mixing of red blue and yellow in front of a white background appears black
Substractive color mixing
which way do you want to go
White stands for absolute purity
the eternal light
that sounds good
Sounds like enlightenment and peace to me
i am going to choose white
would you be willing to die for it
Listen
my son needs me
if i died he would not have anybody left
Mommy
no
no
Give me back my child
i want my child back
Please
Please
i will go to the church and i will pray
i will become a whole new person
i will do everything
Please
Please
Please
Give him back to me
when is your son's birthday
when is your husband's birthday
where did you give birth to your child
on the maternity ward at the hospital or private
Did you deliver it at home
was a midwife present
where was your husband at that time
where did you meet him
on vacation
at a bar or at the dentist
on a shopping spree or even at work
i can not remember
you had a dream of life
but you acted self destructive
Your amnesia displaces your dark doings
all there is left is your little dreamworld
Jennifer you do not have a husband
and you do not have a child
you fucking bastard
you are lying
you are lying
you are lying
what was in that injection you gave me
i want the child
no
no
Mommy
LAYER 3 LEVEL BLUE
no matter what i have done i do not want to die
Poor suffering creature
if i were you i would watch out
it is very dangerous here
how do we get out of here
Out of here
there is no way out of here
here is neither a beginning nor an end
you are here
nothing else exists
what is it you are looking for
i am looking for the bogeyman
he killed my child
i have to kill him
oh a child
an innocent soul
Tender soft skin
Tender meat
Fuck off you freak
if i do not get your child's soul then maybe i could get yours
Go away
i warned you
it is dangerous to walk around here alone
you are going to end up as food for the beasts
i do not care
Go away
Go away
Leave me alone
Hey sexy lady
what is up
i will tell you
i have everything that you need
the finest shit
Acid speed coke ecstasy poppers weed crystal crack and ketamine
so what would you like
nothing
Leave me alone
Hey cunt
i know you
you do not have to act like Saint Mary here
i know for a fact that you need something
and down here i am the only one who can give you what you need
where is above
what
you have just said you are the only one down here who has what i need
so where is above
how do i get there
there is no above
Wrong question
never mind
it is funny
you are not the first one who asked me that today
Really
yes
an old frump came by carrying a little boy in her arms
she was totally confused
Always saying something like she has to bring the little boy back
where did she go
what did the boy look like
what did he look like
Three heads horn on the chest
the way those little poopers always look like
you are asking too much
Thank you
you helped me a lot
See you
no
Go away
Jennifer
i know it is hard for you to articulate but still you found the right way to go
in my dining room everything was red enlightened
in the club everything was green
here everything's blue
Up next and last i am going to be in the white light
i am enlightened
Well done
Still one little step's missing
which one
do you know what you have done
i do not remember anything
who is Joe and Michael
two beloved friends
Irina
my neighbor
she lives in the same building
and Willy
he also lives there
Elisabeth
the old lady next door
she babysits Nico every now and then if i need to go someplace
the postman
he brings you the mail
and Nico
what
what kind of question is that
he is my son
i love him to death
Sebastian
of course
he is my husband
you called all of them by names
are you really sure
yes
i am sure
Well the last step is to get your memory back
are you ready for it
yes
now i know who you are
you are me
you are the good part of me and i am the bad one
i did bad things to people
and now i will have to pay for it
my grief should be a lot worse than what i have done to other people
they sow the wind and reap the whirlwind
Right
you had to undergo what you did to others
it was your karma
i have chosen the physique of a men that you wished for in your dreams
but see for yourself
Sebastian
Sebastian
Jennifer
i am only exisiting in your imagination
Just like Nico
now you will see what you are going to expect
Keep your prophecies for yourself
Why did you do this
you are going to stay in the darkness forever
LAYER 4 LEVEL YELLOW
Substractive color mixing blue yellow red
the result is black
Allegory for the void the sorrow the hell
she is in a coma
no one knows when she will wake up again
anyway she is so pumped full of drugs
i have never seen something like that
it is almost a miracle that she is alive
it would be better if that bitch died
she killed seven people
Life penalty would be too expensive for the taxpayers
it is doubtful if she will ever get a normal mental condition again
in such cases the brain often remains permanently damaged
then we will commit her to a crazy house
this woman spared no one
she even killed an infant
i will definitely stay here
and keep my eyes glued to that bitch
i am coming
Fuck you
i am coming
can you babysit my son for a moment
i need to get some groceries
Si si si
Really
Si si
Hey
hello

that is crazy
and it won't work
yes right
you think so
Come on
Open the fucking door i want to leave
Hurry
and which dealer do you want to see
Wow
that little asshole has a great sense of humor huh
what about your storeroom
i bet there is a whole lot of stuff right
we already splitted the stuff among each other
by the way the doc said you are going to have a screw loose if you wake up again
that is funny because i do not behave like a lunatic so he was wrong
Well i guess you are right
the party is over
i want to know what happened and where my money is
okay okay
200 meter near the bank you were found unconscious the bag with the money was next to you
but obviously your special cocktail knocked you out
Fuck
what are you looking at
never seen a naked woman before
or do you want to fuck
Get out
what are you planning to do
you will find out soon enough
Please do not do anything you will regret later
do not worry
i never regretted anything
Get out
Go ahead
Move it
Come on
there are two things i hate about this job
and that is
if children lie here or if people throw their lifes away
then maybe you should try to get over it
Let's just do our work
can you already tell if it was suicide
yes definitely
11 45 am
in front of us lies the body of a 45 year old woman
5 feet 65 inches tall
132 pounds well nourished
on her back are some red and violet death marks which were caused by light pressure of fingertips
the area of her left and right thighs are covered with plenty of bruises
the body also shows several fractures
the area of the right parietal lobe shows a 5 mm entry wound
the edges of the wound are not adaptable
the edge of the entry wound is circled by 1 mm gunshot residues
and in the gunshot residues ring is a 3 mm graze
Externally you see the exit wound
the gunshot injury still shows some half pieces of the bullet
in the area of the left parietal lobe there is a 5 cm exit wound
the edges of the wound are adaptable
at the end when you die there is no tunnel no white bright light
there is neither the black nor the void
you feel exactly the same way you felt before
you feel pain fear hunger and thirst
Except that you can not make yourself felt anymore
you have to accept everything that is happening to you
that is the real hell
if only there was the eternal nothing the eternal sleep without dreams then this would be the paradise for me
i am Jennifer Goettler i am happily married and have a little son
his name is Nicoyou are not scared are you
Scared
Why should i be scared
we are next to a cemetery
so
if anything were to happen no one would hear a thing
what could possibly happen
Remember the guy they caught the one who was killing kids
yeah
and what
Wanna know the worst
what is that
Chocolate milk
he ate them
Carried parts around in a cooler
Making that up
Am not
my sister knows a newspaper guy
he told her
when they caught him know what was in the cooler
their fingers
oh gross
it is a sheep's eye
from the butcher shop
when you die the last thing you see is on your retina
like a photograph
Grandma says souls live in the eyes
the soul is an invention of witch doctors
there is someone out there
there is no one here
there was
i heard him
Howie
Howie is that you
Howie no more games you hear me
Howie
you forgot to close it
no
you were the last one
Jesus
Why you guys sneaking around
we weren't sneaking
you were
Like a pair of rats
no
Let me go
in the house
Halt
Emily
Wake up Emily
Come back
Let me go
Stay in there
Let me go
what did you do to that thing
you have no right
Thirteen years later
West
what you got there
that some kind of animal
Why Moncho
are you hungry
is that a rat
Your powers of observation are dubious at best
Dubious
Dubious
you wanted me
yes
here
New work assignment
Dubious
oh and it is Sergeant Moncho
Ratty
what did you do to Ratty
Mother of God i ain't seen him i swear
i am sick
Leave me alone
where is Ratty
what is wrong Cabrera
Lose you stinky little pal
Ask West if he is seen him
West likes animals
what do you mean
Think about it dubious
Line up
Let's move
West you seen my Ratty
is he missing
you better tell me Einstein
any identifiable characteristics
Markings
who took him is gonna get markings
you the new doctor
that is right
that way to the Clinic
Warden wants to see you
in films this is the Death House
you would not call it that
what do you call it
the Death House
Prisoners here are
Condemned to death
do not talk until he talks to you first are sex criminals
as a woman that should repulse you
it is very disturbing as a person
but as a reporter it' s an interesting statistic
Good answer Laura
can i call you Laura
Certainly
so you do not believe in rehabilitation
do not be naive Laura
i believe in what works
two thousand volts of raw power from a stand alone generator
this works
when a man sits in it and i make every new prisoner sit in it they submit to my power
Fascinating
you are just saying that
Doctor Phillips
yes sir
Howard Phillips
it is a pleasure Warden Brando
you graduated in the top five per cent of your class
you could have your pick ofjobs
Why here
Institutional medicine interests me
Really
Well
yeah
hi
i am Laura Olney
i am with Arkham Record
anything you say to me will be quoted out of context
Well in that case let me just say hi
hi
we have a fully equipped medical facility
i am sure you do but these are mine
do all doctors have such a relationship with their tools
you requested to have a particular inmate working in the infirmary
we are understaffed and he has a medical background
Keep an eye on him
Sir
he thinks he is smarter than everyone else but he is not
his attitude could infect others
Infect
an idea can be like a disease
if you discover a minor anomaly do you ignore it
Fuck
no Doctor
no
you cut it
some growths are benign
not inside these walls
Sir
there is a situation
0ut of the way
it is the doctor
Forgive me Father for i have sinned
Hear my confession
Just calm down
the blood the flesh the beating heart
i had to eat it
i had to eat it
do not send me to Hell
Get the drop cloth
Keep his back perfectly straight
Sorry
Keep your hands off me
on three okay
one two three lift
this way doctor
0ut of the way
Get the case
are you okay
i am fine
Thanks
i am fine
where do we go
what happened
Heart attack
are you the new doctor
Cute
Get him on the table
Nurse set up the IV
Hurry up
yes doctor
Get me amiodarone

Amiodarone
we have none
you have none
it did not come
what have you got
Try Sotalol
it is similar
Go get it
Come on Nurse
Coming
i can not
could you help her please
Nurse take these guys out of the way
Everybody out
and stay out there
but
Stay with them
Clear
you are wasting time
Clear
Come on
Clear
he was dead before he got here
Goddammit
he was my patient
for five minutes
you are the new doctor
what is the meaning of this
Doctor Herbert West
i know all about you
Really
i know what you did
they tried to cover it up
Your experiments
do not believe what you hear
i did not hear it
i saw
that night they arrested you
i was that kid
i want to work with you
Thirteen years
there is bound to be some deterioration
the reactive base may have destabilized
but maybe not
what are you doing
Seeing if it still works
no
someone could come in
we are treating a patient
the top of the spinal cord
0f course
Hold his head
Hold it
Quickly
how long will it take
i do not think it is going to take
we can increase the dosage
no no
it is not going to work
it might on something else
Thanks for bringing me back my Reagent such as it is
oh well
Wait a minute
Listen
Think about it
Come on
we can make more
in here
this place doesn't have basic first aid as you just found out
but this is my clinic now
what do you need
it still works
you are not dying
how do you feel
you hear me
Stay away
can you hear me
no
we must sedate him
Get the Thorazine
50 cc
no
no
Forgive me please
Forgive me
Dr Phillips
what the fuck's going
he went crazy sir
Severe cardiac arrhythmia
a reaction to medication
what medication
we administered 10 cc of Sotalol but it provoked an unexpected effect
you call this an unexpected effect
the patient suffered arterial fibrillation
his heart was beating too fast
Allergic reaction is not unusual
West you have just added twelve months to your sentence
it is swollen
Doctor Phillips one of my men is hurt
i will see to him
Sergeant that is an immediate Lock down
yes Sir
the rest of your visit will be outside of the security areas
Warden
West the lockdown includes you
Doctor Phillips asked me for a list of the supplies we need
Right
i need that list
Clean him up and get him to the Hole
Come on
Get up
West get to your cell
my last partner turned State's evidence on me
i expect better of you
and watch out for her
she is trouble
hi there
hi
Just organizing my notes
you were right about my ankle
i should stay off it
Hard to push in the clutch
how about i drive you home
are you sure
i am putting you to trouble
on a day like this it is no trouble
had yourself a big day Moses
Beat the hell out of 4 grown men while having a heart attack
how did you do that
they gave you some medication
what was it
i know why i am here
yes
i am dead and this is Hell
i will show you what Hell is
West
you and me have got to talk man
West
West
Sorry about the tofu
i should know
this pizza's great
i have had a great time
Great
the way you handled that interview impressed me
i did such a great job i was thrown out
State Penitentiary Progressive Educational is so stupid
Come on do not give up
Anything's possible
See the possibilities and seize the moment
Go for it
Go for it
yeah
okay i will go for it
what are you really doing here
Institutional medicine
Tell me about your secret i M research
of course
i am investigating the effects of institutionalization on life and death
yes
yeah
Why do your residency in the joint
Really
Why Howard
as a kid i saw my sister die
i am so sorry
i never want to feel helpless again
i tried to resuscitate her
i wanted to bring her back
who was helping you today
Doctor Herbert West
he is a prisoner but he worked at a university hospital
he researched death as a disease
one of his reanimation experiments lost control
the man went crazy violent
Like the man today
and escaped from the Morgue
the morgue
he broke into our house
that expression reminds me of Emily
Your sister
you are going
it is been a long day
yeah
Looks like your ankle is better
yeah
Seize the moment
Go for it
you got everything
Moses is not doing so good
we need lab
Space somewhere private
he doesn't seem human
i think this will do
he is a monster
he was the freshest specimen we could find
it is a problem
it is a problem
i want to help people not create mindless freaks
Having second thoughts
all medical research requires risks
if you do not see you should not be here
Soon i will find a force to bring order to that chaotic organism
Away to restore rational behaviour
i can now accelerate the testing phase of my current work
with your help
this work requires commitment and full confidentiality
you must tell no one
i will walk
Lipstick on your collar
Doctor Phillips i am going to be leaving now
what is that for
Doctor Phillips
do you need anything
are you there
i was afraid you weren't coming
i was working late
on what
nothing
Just clinic stuff
what are you doing investigating me
no
yeah
i was wondering how the man was doing
he is fine
Really
Doesn't seem human anymore
we should not have
you should not have what
what is the matter
the story i am on
i figured out some stuff but it is just speculation
you need hard facts
yeah
but to get them i will have to take some risks
what do i do
Play it safe or go for it
you have got to go for it
Really
you got to take some chances
that is what you are doing is not it
what is your new story about
can not tell you yet
Secrets
every girl needs a few secrets
it hurts so much
i can not even spit Doc
i do not see anything
Once they gave me little red pills
Vicodin made me feel better
little red pills
little red tits
Take two at bedtime
how about now
can i have more
Today's the day cabrn
Today's the day
i will see you in the yard
you are a dead man
Adead man
Today's the day
it worked
Reschedule the afternoon
but doctor
now
to test it
on who
my story is not working it is too impersonal
Something's missing
and it is you
you are the key
the key
to what
to understanding how this prison works
everything is an extension of your philosophy
I'd like another look around
Afterwards i will need you for an in depth interview
I'd be happy to do the interview if
lf
if we do it over dinner tonight
you get to know the man behind the office
after my tour
Consider Miss Olney my personal guest
yes sir
and give her the tour again
Why did you come back
to finish a profile on you
Really
you are a fascinating man
you are just saying that
Tonight then
Did you know the human body loses 3 to 4 grms
of weight at the moment of death
i heard about that
a rodent loses much less but the ratio is the same
the cerebral cortex is the site of an extraordinary neuro electric phenomenon
Hold him
Hold him
Tightly
Ratty is not going to be very happy
this phenomenon
NPE Nano Plasmic Energy is not just in the brain
it moves throughout the nervous system and is present in every cell of the body
Hold him a little
Classic post reanimation
Confused violent
Like all my other subjects to date
this brought him back from the dead
but this will give him true life
what is that
the Nanoplasm from a living donor rat
Donor rat
now hold him
Completely still
this is the catalyst
this is the force that tells the cells how to grow
it works
Laura
Doctor Phillips how are you
Why are you here
Just going for it
that the way to the hole
Certainly is
i would really like to talk to him
not a chance
my Editor gives expenses for stories
how much are we talking here
the cell door has to be locked
i will be back in ten minutes
what if i need you
do i call
not a sound
no one can know you are in there
he can not hurt you in that straight jacket
Look who is coming
she is going to see Moses
Why else would she do there
all right give him to me
any last words pendejo
Ratty
what happened
i gave him his pet back
are you gonna let him go
Give Daddy a kiss
what is wrong Ratty
hi
i am Laura Olney i am a journalist
i want to talk about what happened the other day
do you remember what Dr West did to you
Did you die from that heart attack
can i check your pulse
Mother of God forgive me
what happened to you
Hungry
Sergeant Moncho
Thank God you are here
you must think i am an idiot
no i do not
Really
you are a very intelligent man
Fascinating
i do not like people lying to me
i was not lying
Explain
Give me that
he attacked me
he is dead
you are right
what are you doing
i murdered him
that is what they will say
you know the cretins out there
it was self defence
you had no choice
i will swear to it
Get down
you are going to have to convince me
Lower
Bark
what
you heard me
Bark
Am i the most fascinating man you have met
yes
and you'd do anything for me
yes sir
Show me
you bribed a guard came in and freed a dangerous prisoner
he got excited
i wanna get Moses up here
Why
to put this in him
you have got more
no
this is Ratty's NPE
i gave Ratty the nanoplasm of a different rodent
are not they different
not at all
Nanoplasm is a completely neutral energy
it is the same in rats dogs human beings
you want to put this in Moses
yes
Going from rat to rat is okay but from species to species is not right
not right
all this is the result of years and years of painstaking research under incomprehensible conditions
how dare you say my work is wrong
you can not transfer the soul
the soul
this is science not superstition
this is a human being
was human
and will be again with this
Dr Phillips
1 2 3 up
Dr Phillips
there is been an incident
no
no
Moses killed her in the Hole
he is dead too
Dead
the Warden needs Death Certificates
now
Get rid of the nurse
Nurse help the officers
but
Get out
what if she ends up like Moses
she is not getting fresher
Come on
Top of the spinal cord right
Right
Thorazine
do not want her getting too excited
Hurry up
what is her name
Remember
Leave her
this is not a good idea
what is she doing
we can not leave her like this
Let's get her to the lab
Stop here
where did he go
he is got to be here somewhere
Look everywhere
Everywhere
Poor little thing
Come on go get your food
Let go you freak
what is going on
Give it back
you little
no
and why not
it is cross species
then she will stay like this
you can not experimenting on her
now look Rat NPE
Dr Phillips
Get her down
where is the body
she
what is going on in here
Mr West and i we
you have set up a Lab
you are doing illegal research
you will lose your job for this and your medical license
Move
this is what you gave Moses
you are never going to see the outside of these walls again
no
no
you are dead
no
Hold it there
Come back here
Back in your cell
it is party time
what are you doing
Wait
Just a second
two thousand volts of electric current will concentrate the nanoplasm to the brain so we can pull it off
you will electrocute him
that is the idea
Only through electrocution can you drive the nanoplasm to the hypothalamus where we can extract it at the moment of death
you wanna put his nanoplasm into Laura
Rodent to rodent no problem
but human to human
do you want Laura to stay like that
Sit him up
Head down on his chest
Move
Hold his head still
Hold his head still
he is not dying
he is not dying
Clear
that is enough
Stop it
he has to die
Go to the infirmary
Let's go
Ratty
Ratty
Give daddy a kiss
Howard
where am i
you are okay now
something happened to me
you could say that
Why are you looking at me
Warden Brando strangled you
you were dead
Doctor Phillips and i brought you back

Stay away

Stop
Howard
Howard please
Please help me
Howard
West

Hiding is not gonna do you
Listen Ratty's acting really weird

Contagious

Well maybe i did
or maybe they killed themselves
they could not stand living with their crimes
they could not stand looking in the mirror one more day
me i like what i see in the mirror
the Death House was built for one purpose
Punishment
the problem with execution is it happens too fast
one moment of pain and you are dead
you are off the hook
Today's criminals are not scared any more
he looks scared to me
Just acting
they are all actors here
Execution is the kindest thing we could do for them
but what if the agony of Death did not end in an instant
but instead was prolonged indefinitely
Move out
Quick
Quick

Mother of God
Forgive me for i have sinned

who
my bank
a guy from my bank
my bank sent some guy over
God i can not be that far overdrawn
all right
yeah tell him i will be right down
Ned Lewis
yeah
Lenny Brown
can we talk in your office
so you are from Manufacturer's Hanover Trust
no where did you get that idea
i thought you told Johnny
i told him i am with Equity Appreciation Associates
if he got the idea i was a banker
i am no banker Ned
i want to talk to you about saving 250 000 on your income tax this year
is this a joke
Cattle feed is highly leveraged
the write off this year is four to one
it is all done blue sky
it is perfectly kosher
Look i made 28 200 last year
i am just a working stiff
i am talking about the interest income
from that money your father gave you
my father did not give me any money
Your father is Edward Lewis at Dreyfus right
Where'd you get an idea like that
my father's a professor at CUNY
this girl you went out with she works with my wife
she mentioned you
what girl
she said your father was a famous guy about money and i put two and two together
Teaches Economics
Hardly famous
you do not know anybody who could use a 250 000 tax shelter do you
not personally
i am such a schmuck
Sorry
Wrong me i guess
Thanks for not jerking me around
i leave a piece of my soul on the floor every time i do this song and dance
no problem
Go out like a battleship come back like a raft
Thanks
you have really got a four to one write off
that is what they tell me
can i buy you lunch as my way of apologizing
no that is okay really
Please I'd like the company
yeah
okay
i could never be in sales
it hurts your feelings too much when you get turned down
sometimes i get discouraged depressed but you got to shrug it off
i could let it get to me go around fractured but thank God i got somebody at home
she won't ask Did you make the sale
she will just hug and kiss me and i am whole again
Len you are a lucky man
i know that
i keep reminding myself
you got a wife or anything
no nothing
You'd have to take second best anyhow
if you saw Lin and me at a restaurant like this you'd say there is a mismatch
i have seen it in people's eyes
how did a guy like that get a girl like her
he must be rich
not that i am not trying
here is the funny part
Money doesn't mean a thing to Linda
it is nice to hear somebody talk about his wife that way
most of the guys i know they put their wives down all the time
would you like to meet her
Sure
Sometime
you could come to dinner
here is my card
so what do you think
Tonight
Tonight
Dinner at our place
you do not want to check with your wife
i will tell her i met a guy invited him
she will say Great no sweat
you will wonder how a schmuck like me wound up with a beauty like Linda
Funny way to start a friendship me thinking you were someone else
Back to the salt mines
got to catch a cab
Thanks for lunch
Anytime
See you tonight
Right
Bye bye
Linda Ned is here
Welcome to Casa Brown
Let me take your coat
Linda Ned is here
it is still raining
this is Ned Lewis of the Financial Journal
hello Ned
Pleased to meet you
was i right
you were right
is she like the most beautiful girl you ever met
no question
he loves me
what do you do
i am a paralegal at a corporate law firm
Sounds interesting
Dull as dishwater
Lenny's the talent in the family
she is being modest
you should see her dance
do you dance
does she dance
she dances like a dream
i wanted to be a ballerina
i guess most little girls do but
no buts about it
you will have whatever you want
that is a promise
i am happy just taking classes
i am a little too old to be a professional
now i bet you never heard a beautiful girl admit to that
so how long have you been with Equity
oh Equity Appreciation Associates
Well i am not really with them
i am freelancing
i do P R work some favors here and there
the problem is the E a a Won't give me decent leads
that is how i wound up barking up your tree this morning
Lenny told me about the mistake
i did not know whether to laugh or cry
he was sort of counting on that sale to break into the business
that thing doesn't mean anything to Ned
does it
what kind of thing
Hustling for money
you are above all that
i worry about money just like everybody else
but you got some backstops
you start falling down that well you got some slats across to catch yourself all right
i saw a funny thing on the bus today
a man got on with a French horn
you got your professor father
you got an education
you got the Financial Journal
you can not fall too far
the bus driver wanted the man with the French horn to pay an extra fare because the French horn took up so much room
because the French horn took up so much room
my old man's an ex printer on disability
my mother is a secretary for the Ladies Garment Workers Union
so the man with the French horn he said that he would play a concert for everybody instead and he did
i got a high school education all the way across 86th Street
it was beautiful
i cried
i drank too much wine
you only had two glasses
you are just tired
you work too hard
i am a little tired i guess
what do you think of Ned
he seems very nice
i wonder if we could get a little blurb in the Journal about Manny's Pizza Parlor
you know how he started
it is a great success story
Lenny you can not ask him
it is the Financial Journal
it would be worth 1 000
my heart falls in on itself when you look at me like that
i love you
it hurts me to see you belittle yourself
i know
you are right
sometimes i think i can not cut it
no matter how hard i try like i am in quicksand
and the more i struggle the deeper i sink
it will be all right
do not ever leave me
Silly I'd never leave you
i know things look bleak
Things are not bleak Lenny
i am very happy
do not you know that
Just stick with me please
Till i fall off the earth
Come to bed
Make love to me
Good morning
Hallis Richardson
may i say who is calling
one moment please
Mr Rogers on seven
Good morning
Hallis Richardson
Please hold
Reception
yes Mr Hallis
they are ready for you Mr Brown
Thank you
Call me Lenny
Gentlemen Mr Brown has applied to be our sales rep on the Connecticut project
Tell us a little bit about yourself Mr Brown
Gentlemen i won't bore you with the reading of my resume some of which is even true
i assume you all know how to read
besides we are born again with each new project
and all your past successes do not cut much ice when it comes to the big question
will it sell
then tell us Mr Brown
will it sell
Sure it will sell
over the life of the partnership everyone will enjoy some small tax benefits realize a nice safe though modest return on their investment
you do not need me for that
but will it soar
that is another question
and i am afraid the answer is no
when your aunt and cousins visit you won't rush them to this mall because you do not really identify with it
Sure it is quaint i guess
but it is also boring
People struggle against smallness all their lives
Let them identify with something big
you got a duplex theater here
Show a or Show B that is it
you know there is a place in Toronto that has 17 screens
there is one in Beverly Hills
Connecticut is not Beverly Hills
Everybody wants a taste of Beverly Hills even in Connecticut
Especially in Connecticut believe me
you want people coming to your mall not because they can buy things here they could get cheaper somewhere else
you want them to have an experience
you know what i mean
you did not stand a chance kid
Thanks
Excuse me for breathing
nothing personal
you had vision talked a kind of poetry
it scared them
These guys wear suspenders and belts
i should've told them what they wanted to hear give less than i got but
i can not give less than i got
i do not know how
my name is Max Sherman
Let me buy you a drink
Thank you
Cheers
Family
a wife
we haven't had time to have children yet
yeah me neither
so where are you from
i got a couple things out here some stuff in Texas
my major operations are in southern California
you live out there
i live where the money is
you do not think this New York crowd would have anything to do with me unless i could move millions of bucks around do you
Your wife work
yeah she has a great job
yeah lucky for you
i do all right
everything i do is just a lot chancier that is all
yeah you just probably haven't found the right products yet the right territory
got any suggestions
L a southern California
Real estate that won't ever go bad
every year in L a there is this whole crop of people who never had money
and this year they made a ton of it
and then they find out that the government wants half
what is this
yeah that is where i come in
you got to know a little about taxes and limited partnerships but most of all you got to know how to sell
you are describing me Mr Sherman
Did you ever take a vow to stay in New York
Los Angeles is a great place
we do not have any friends there
we do not have friends here
we have each other
we will still have each other you and me
Linda this is my big chance
what about my job
you are not gonna work in L a
for a change i will be supporting you
you can dance
no maybe we are going too fast
we should just take this a step at a time
the hell with that
you do not step through life
Teacher may i
it goes too quick for that
you got to leap through life
what about our apartment and all our stuff
this dump
this junk
you think i will take this crap to L a
we will get new furniture that is right for L a
you think a successful man in L a
Asks his wife to sit on junk like this
Forget about it
Come and get it
we are out of here
are you crazy
Come on
are you with me
Let me see you leap
Lenny look
i am Lenny Brown
yes sir
Mr Sherman arranged for your car
may i carry your bags
Thank you
Coat
Thank you
Come this way please
Just follow me
Mr Brown would you hit the play button on the cassette machine please
Thank you
Welcome to L a
Sorry i could not pick you up myself kids but business is business
i had my girl fix you up in a little place in the Hollywood hills
i think it will be comfortable for you
she is laid in some food and vino
so you should celebrate if you feel like it
Tomorrow at 9 00 in the morning we work
in the meantime unpack relax have a swim
have a swim
there you are
you thought you were gonna be next to an air shaft
i wonder what they are all doing tonight
who
the poor people of the world
it is like a dream is not it
Want to wake up
no never
me neither
last one to the other side loses
Lf everything works out
which it will there is only one thing i want
anything
i want a baby
Take two they are small
i mean it
can we
if everything works out
you would make such a terrific mother
are you serious really
would you want to
we can go through the motions
she is a heartbreaker kid
did not i tell you
can you see her with me
my mother used to say there is a lid for every pot
down to business
Did you do your homework
i am ready
this is it
the appreciation on this building because of the proximity to the harbor the good air quality and ample parking will outstrip most comparable properties
the write off for the purchase and the conversion of the offices should run two to one over the seven year investment
we have had a ruling from the IRS classifying us a limited partnership but for tax purposes as most of your deductible losses count towards this tax year it is a question of giving money to Uncle Sam
or owning a percentage of prime property
what is the price per 20 000 a unit Dr Shapiro
all right Lenny i will take five units
you are in
Dr Bishop
i will talk it over with my wife
it is going to be a very popular offering
we can not guarantee there will be any left
all right five
Great
by Friday the partnership should be fully invested
a two to one write off this early in the year
you already sold it
do not buy it back
Bonjour
this way please
Enjoy your lunch Mr Sherman
yes thank you
you are welcome
been here before
this is my table
any guest comes with me he knows where i will sit
Look around you
a lot of tables right
Wrong
Five tables
all the rest of the people come here to eat
Food's pretty good
those tables strictly for Michigan
the people have probably read about the place from the hotel magazine
These tables
Ray Tucker manages the money for half the Rams all the Raiders everybody you ever saw on TV
Five percent off the top
Carter Davis oil
Ricky Holtz builds airports
Doc Gertz used to be a chiropractor now he produces movies
and me
we do not come here to eat
so what are you saying Max
i should not order any food
Eat
Just do not look hungry
George
i have Mrs Brown on the phone sir
Thank you
hello
hi
you still love me
who was that
my secretary
you ready for that
i do not know how to act around her
i am afraid she will tell me i am doing something wrong
how is your office
we could live in it
Guess how much money i made in the first hour today how much i earned for us
i do not know
Just guess 100
Try 5 000
that is impossible
i swear to God people here they can not wait to lay off their money
two doctors went for my pitch
they were in a hurry to go back and generate more money
it is not to be believed
God why did we take so long to find this place
we are gonna be rich you hear me
Rich
i like what you did in there kid
you put in a good day made a good dollar
Go home and have a drink
Like the house
Beautiful Max
Thanks a lot
it is only rented by the week
Out here you got to start scoring baskets right off the bench
or you are out of the game
do not worry
this is the work i was meant to do
you can sell no question
you got an instinct about that
Selling's more important to me than money
' Cause every time i sell it means somebody believes in me
Right
first month build a little bank account
then after that i expect you to pay your fair share of the rent okay
okay Max no problem
this is not your car
no it is yours
you need a car in L a
you expect me to be your chauffeur
Go on get behind the wheel
Jesus
Max this is a Mercedes
do not have a coronary

down the road if you want to buy it i will make you a good deal
in the meantime enjoy it
i do not know what to say Max
that is a first for me
Get behind the wheel
yes sir
you can find your way home
yeah i think so
he thinks so
Go on get out of here
Tomorrow morning 9 00 a m we will make some more money together

and his charming wife
Linda
Eat drink make contacts
where did you say you met him
he bought into a deal
he is the young guy with 42 carwashes and mega tax problems
Want to eat something
there is a little buffet
he throws a nice party
what is really nice is Uncle Sam pays for half
and he was not even invited
i will call you tomorrow
i just made a sale
that is good Lenny
Good
my commission's going to be 26 000 while you were sipping a glass of wine while i was munching like a handful of macadamia nuts
he is talking to a friend of his
Suppose the friend wants in
do not look
you okay
i feel a little out of place
you are
you are the best looking woman here
People here are a little strange
Talented people can be strange
the discretionary spending power at this party is enormous
then maybe that is it
Come on
you are not enjoying yourself
Come on
I'd rather be home with you
is that so terrible
Lenny
Michael
have you met Rochelle yet
she lives with Joel
i am not living with Joel
i am a stewardess for a major airline mister
sometimes i stay here when i am in town but i do not live here
Excuse me my mistake
you think i have to depend on people like Joel
Listen i have been on planes with people who took me out to dinner and then i let them take me back to their hotels and the next morning they took me to Cartier's and told me to pick anything
and i am gonna live with Joel who thinks he is a rajah because he is got a couple of carwashes
Give me a small fucking break
i think Lenny and Linda were on their way home Rochelle
Say good night princess
Good
Go home
Goodbye
Good night
Get fucked
Call me a schmuck but i love the little bitch
it is the coke talking guys
you would not know her when she is straight
i got to keep her away from the coke got to keep her away from Michael
Life a continuous struggle huh
Good night Joel
Take care kids
Thank you
i did not know she was high on coke
they were all on something
Thank you
i did not see anything did you
you did not have to see anything
Money's the real drug around here okay
Thank you
Nice house though
so i thought the old lady was lost
she was wearing this babushka and this thing you would throw over an old sofa
she wrote a check for 150 000 i got the message
i sent over to Berlitz for some guy who could speak Farsi
an hour later she is a partner all handshakes and smiles
i got the printers working overtime because of you turning out brochures
Nobody reads them
they read them
Come on in
you are late
hi Max
hi sweetheart
what is going on
what are you doing here
what is going on
that is the problem with the younger generation
no sentiment
one year ago today you started here
to my best salesman and his beautiful wife
it is been a wonderful year
you do not miss New York
Maybe someday we will go back for a visit if i can ever find the time
Find time to play kids
Find time to play
it is funny you should mention that
i bought a plane today
a fly in the sky plane
it is a good tax write off
we finance it and i can write off the interest as well
a man needs his toys Linda
it is just a prop job
who is gonna fly this plane
i will hire a guy
i am just trying it out to see if i like having my own plane
then i will go on to a jet
it is fine Lenny
okay Cabo San Lucas
Ole
some Mexican food maybe a little business
Let's fly
Taxi
Por favor
Bueno
all right
how are you doing pal
Hasta porta por favor
the port
it takes 100 000 to get in on the bidding
no problem
i think this place could be a gold mine
it is nonrefundable Lenny if you back out
Joel i do not back out of things
i know
i just feel i got to tell you
i am in
Gracias
i got a hunch we can get our money out of that joint in the first year
you never know Lenny there is a risk
i do not think we are looking for a passbook savings account kind of investment
i am looking for a free toaster
Cabo San Lucas is gonna be bigger than Puerta Vallarta
the big bucks will roll in the winter
Let me ask you this
Why are we taking in partners
what is wrong with just you and me
Michael's put in 150 000 there is a few shortstops who have signed
i guess you could buy them out but they will want a little profit
so
Fair enough
so
Fair enough
500 000 ought to cure it for you 500 000
not a bad idea
Spread the risk
that is the smart move
Joel i can swing it man
i just got to rearrange a few things
you are about a mover
yeah
we should've stayed over
the whole idea of going to Cabo San Lucas for dinner is to come back the same night
any postal worker can go to Cabo on a weekend excursion
Caramba
i find it
God i am so tired
hi Mitzi
Lenny
yeah
about that nightclub
yeah how about that
we can have our own joint
everyone wants to own a nightclub but we are actually gonna do it
it is great
i know and i think i know what it means to you but we are behind on the American Express bill
Linda please
i mean even after all this you think i am a bum
i am making money so fast over at Max's they can not keep track of it
Everybody in town thinks i am a firecracker
and my own wife still thinks i am a bum
i think you are a genius
i just do not want you to feel like you are on a treadmill having to make more and more money to pay for things we bought but do not need
the way things are going the money going out won't be missed if it never comes back
when you get to where we are nothing can touch you
and you are with me
we are together
we are like a team
you think i would ever let anything hurt you
Ever
Good morning Veronica
Pat
Good morning Alice
how are you
hi Max
okay so who died around here
so when do you show up at 10 00 like a banker
Max what happened
a deal fell through
we are getting audited
what
you do not read the Journal
you ought to read the Journal
so the lawyers will find a way around it
it is not even close to passage
this may never happen
you do not get it
what is to get
i have been on the phone for an hour and no one's returning my calls
to get is so far this morning while you are playing banker
Shirley has taken 11 calls from investors who want out
Three other lawyers have called saying they got to have their deposits back by this afternoon or they are gonna find any angle to sue on
we are in deep shit
it is starting to sink in
Mr Michures we made a deal
Your client is committed
Even if they did not allow a deduction for dollar one it'd be a great investment
Believe me you are gonna get the write off
some asshole in Washington is just trying to start a panic that is all
do not tell me about your lawyers because
Sorry to call so late but i had a chance
how is it going world beater
any takers
can i just put you on hold for a second please
yeah
Thank you
Man people are spooked Max
they do not know how to handle rumors
they will come around
they have got to
Why is that
because everybody wants California real estate do not they
Sure they do but they do not want it from us with us taking 20 percent off the top unless it is got that tax break
without that why should they want to buy a shithouse from us
do not take it so hard
this is the first scare we have had in this business
if nothing else happens in the next couple of months maybe six months we could be back to speed
it is going to be six months before we have any money coming in
Worse
we will have to dig into the piggy bank
Save that option on the La Cienega property
Ought to kick in for the overhead here
Think of it as a vacation
Take a trip
Spend some of that heavy money you have been making
and me i am gonna go home
and i am gonna have me a drink
and then i am gonna have a hot tub
all right so we got us a rainy day
can not go on forever
Good night kid
do not forget the lights
Good night Max
hi Doctor
i am sorry i kept you on hold
hello
Lenny Brown speaking
Lenny have you forgotten the party
what party
have you had a bad day
Joel's party
Shit
we do not have to go
we have to go
i will be home in half an hour
Earth calling Lenny
Linda do not try to be cute not tonight
you like it when i am cute
is it business
yeah it is business
Whatever it is we are gonna be all right
it must be nice
if it is money we can cut back
i can go back to work
I'd like to anyway
it is boring doing nothing all day
Boring
i am busting my balls off so you can live like a queen and now you tell me it is been boring
it must be bad
you hardly ever start a fight
it is bad
we are several hundred thousand dollars in debt and we got no more income
how
Let's not go
Let's go home
Let's hold each other
that is what they expect us to do lie in the shadows and lick our wounds
they will know i have been beaten
Even if they have to take everything if we have to go bankrupt
we still have each other
Linda i am scared
Baby we will make it as long as we have each other
i wanted you to have everything
Come on
Lenny
Linda
i am glad you came
Buddy can you spare a dime
Seriously Joel could you lend me a little something until my brother straightens out
he is a hunchback
See
did not i tell you
you can not keep a good man down
this guy doesn't cave in because of the fucking media
he is already into something else
Incredible
so do we party
yeah absolutely
Talk to me Lenny
i am your pal
it is closed down
Nobody's doing any business Joel
i am in deep shit
you do not sell real estate deals
you sell Lenny Brown right
that means you can sell anything
Airplanes computers this shit
Help yourself
i never touch the stuff
it will take you off your ass
Joel i do not know anything about computers or airplanes man
I'd have to start all over again
what is this negative talk
you are killing the old fireball
you need a boost kid
you need to clear away the cobwebs
i got enough problems all right
what
do you think it will be habit forming
do you think you will have a monkey on your back
it is a boost
Come on
it is a tough track we are on boychick
the winners always have an edge
it is 90 percent mental out there
you accomplish what you trick your brain into believing you can accomplish
you accomplish what you trick your brain into believing you can accomplish
Faith may move mountains
this stuff makes them fly
if you have never tried it you are the last one in town
what is the problem
See this guy here
you know that park in Beverly Hills
i am gonna build a statue in that park with a plaque that says
to my best friend Joel who saved my life
what are friends for
must have been some pep talk
was there a problem
you do not have to know the product only the people
who knows people better than Lenny Brown
i am going to sell 747 s internationally
Look
that is wonderful
how do you get started
can you imagine the commission on a 747
you will wonder what was Lenny doing pissing away his time
on petty real estate scams
wondering what some bureaucrat would leak to the papers in Washington
Cocktails
Want another drink
yeah come on
Dance ballerina dance
what
Sweetheart i am exhausted
Let's go to bed
one more dance
the neighbors
i can not keep my eyes open
they have discovered a cure for that
Lenny is that what i think it is
do not turn little old lady on me okay
it is Joel's
i needed a boost
you saw me before the party right
i wanted to be dead
now i got my old energy and confidence back
i got plans to get us out of this mess
but cocaine we never needed that before
Come on
you know what it is like
it is like good champagne that is all
what is it do to you
it bumps up your natural energy level
Look
Look at that see
i have watched Rochelle
all it does for her is turn her into a real bitch
that is Rochelle
she started as a real bitch
here
you sniff this up
if you do not like it throw the rest in the pool
hi honey
i got it nailed down
i have got the greatest idea for a medical and dental leaseback plan
it is fail safe
no matter what happens to the new tax law the crisis is over
Great
you want to sell helicopters
it is not the money Max you know
i just got to keep working
i will go stale
what about that leaseback idea you had
Nobody liked it
okay
we are not selling buildings now but we sold a lot of buildings
they all need maintenance which happens to be done by a company called Century West Maintenance Company
Yours
mine
Want to manage that
Get a small salary keep using the car
Once in a while a free lunch on the account
Things will pick up here
we will be back where we were
you do not want to sell helicopters
that is for losers
Mr Brown how nice to see you
Nice to see you
Right this way please
Thank you
it was a period of reorganization
now it is time to come out and play
is not that sweet
we owe our friends a nice meal and the pleasure of our company
Always a pleasure
i love you guys
Good table
Thank you
Enjoy your evening
could we have a bottle of Taittinger
Make it a magnum
Certainly sir
and after dinner a little surprise
i love surprises
i am like a child
he is a child
we are all children
we are going to fly to fabulous Las Vegas for Steve Martin's midnight show
Well excuse me
i knew you would not cool off for long
what is the deal
something new you will have to explain to a dummy like me
something maybe real
Let's just say
Thank you very much
it involves plays of Eurodollars against oil shipments
Holy shit you have left me behind buddy
Eurodollars
you got to give the impression you are in motion
he knows what you are doing but you must make him think you are doing something
something mysterious complex
yeah
Big bucks something
Just keep in motion
one small question
who is paying for all this
i dipped into Max's maintenance account for about 20 000
do not worry
it is nothing
he is not going to hold it against his best salesman
so i took a little cash for a few months
i left a check in his safety deposit box
Believe me this is not a problem
a worthless goddamn check
what are you getting hysterical about
it was a loan
in all my life i never treated anyone like i treated you
you were poor i made you rich
you were drowning i gave you a yacht
you stole from me
i treated you like a son 20 000
you want another check
i will write you
Your check is no damn good
you want to be a liar as well as a thief
Tell me what to do
Just tell me Max
you got to go
i can not have you around here anymore
hi Tony
Mr Brown
i am sorry
the leasing company took away your car
i cleaned out your personal stuff
i have got it in the office
Thank you Mr Brown
Thanks
Mitzi
Did you see a little black and white dog
no ma'am
Put it anywhere
is it ready yet
Come and get it
i miss my puppy
i was thinking what a great
he is going to be all right
Your husband's had a phase 2 reaction to cocaine
how long has he been using the drug
Cocaine
do you know how much he took
my husband doesn't use drugs
he doesn't even drink anything stronger than wine
He'd been at a party
Somebody must've slipped him something
Thank you
i was so scared but i did not tell them anything
Did you use any of that stuff
no
Did you throw it out
i did
i had to buy it off the street
that is what happens
and i am supposed to be smart
what about the hospital bill
i put it on the American Express card
you got any
yeah
where did you get it
from Michael
Good
Great
he wanted to fuck me for it
Son of a bitch
i will kill him man
do not look at me like that
I'd never do anything like that
so how did you pay for it
i hocked my ring
what time is it
12 30
he is not here
he said he'd be here at 12 00
i know he said he'd be here at 12 00
i was the one who talked to him remember
i wonder when it was you started talking to me that way
you want to wait
do you
Maybe we should try someplace else
Let's go
we do not even know him
he is a total stranger to us
we got to go they are going to call the cops
they say somebody dumped him on the back porch
i am not going to live like this
i do not care if Joel is rich and i am poor
it doesn't matter that everybody else has money
I'd rather be a field hand than live in this cesspool
what is happened to us
we got to get out of this goddamn town
Out of the hustles deals the Joels and the coke and the goddamn pain
this is not just talk is it
you saw that kid back there
that could have been us like that
then i can tell you
what
i am pregnant
i thought i was going to have to get an abortion the way things were going
but we can have this baby can not we
if we go to a regular town and clean up and be good parents
everything changes
as of today i won't fail you again
Morning Lenny
Morning Mary
Looks like a good one
yeah
we were the first store here to stock that board
Really
yeah 4 ounce glass
Light as a feather
Feel it
that goes through waves like it is got a mind of its own
State of the art kid
this is one bad fucking rail
the baddest
you buying
you finance
i made a mistake when i left my wife he told a pal
i wanted the good life
i thought that meant wild parties and fancy living
it doesn't
Did you ever go to any movie star parties when you were in L a
no we traveled in different circles
had some wild times
not like here
yeah
what kind of job did you have
i did not work
what did you do
i took dancing lessons
Shitfire we are gonna be late
Hurry up Linda
it is great
yeah it is great
i told Mr Hendricks you'd be hard to replace
Why Australia
they got really good beer there
i ought to keep moving
i know you got to work to live but if you play it right you can work a lot less and live a lot more
besides chicks dig my accent
how did you get to be so smart so soon
no thanks
i forgot you do not ever touch the stuff
never
does Linda
how is she doing
she is doing great
it was my problem
she got into it because of me
so i go to the meetings
they help me i help her
it all works out
i got a going away present for you
you are kidding
no
you sell them so well it is time you learned how to ride one
what is the problem
with the exception of my wife nobody gave me anything without working an angle for themselves
Thanks Tim
i am going to treasure this
Sure
i gotta go
i will send you a postcard from down Under
when i am back we will ride some waves
Take it easy Lenny
Thanks Tim
Look at this
you going to surf
Tim gave it to me
hi
Dolores has a boyfriend
what
his name is Richard
he has a brother who lives in Sequoia
yeah
where is that
every couple of weeks he drives a pickup truck in the window of his brother's house
Dolores says it is because he is always fucked up on Maui Wowie
we talk about it all the time
would you like to go out tonight instead
yeah
I'd like to go to that little Italian place near second Avenue on 72nd Street
God you are homesick
i am not complaining
i did not realize
i thought it was perfect here
it is
it is perfect
if we go back to New York it will be the rat race all over again
i might just as well go back to L a
i just miss
i do not know what i miss
Just interesting people
Dancing
at least we had friends
it is all a smoke screen right
you are building some huge ass development with Aetna or somebody right
Like a new city
i manage a small sporting goods store
i make 400 a week and i work hard for it
do not kid me Slick
i am going to grab Rochelle and come up and check you out
any time
i will book you a room at the Howard Johnson's
all we got is a small one bedroom apartment
you are an original kid
Take it easy
Give my love to Rochelle
Hey give it yourself
we are on our way
Adios amigo
i did not know he'd invite himself up
Well you know Joel
Odds are he will never make it
the way you make your money is you go short against the soybean but long on the soybean oil or maybe it is the other way around
anyway it is called a straddle
Protects the downside
Listen i will catch you later Ron
do not lose the pulse rate man
a little TLC he will be as good as new
do you know anyone who might want him
i can not have a dog in my apartment
not offhand
you could put a note on my bulletin board
you think just for tonight you might know somebody who could keep him
Just so he is nice and taken care of
i do not believe it
you got knocked up
it agrees with you
you look more beautiful
Lenny's not back yet
Same old Lenny
Too busy to stop
and that is Baxter and Miss Porter
and this guy's Milton McNeil
Once they have all had a good sniff of each other they will all get along famously with your poor friend
okay but only one line because of the baby
this late in pregnancy coke doesn't make any difference
who told you that
a mother of three
i have been real real good in Santa Cruz
here lies Linda Brown
she was real real good
not even wine or coffee
you can be our designated drag

Seems like old times

i apologize
Shut up
both of you
i am sorry
i better get going
the next few days i will find somebody to take care of this little guy
Want to talk about it
i am a super listener
Mini crisis

Good clean fun
Even Rochelle's being nice
Dolores and her Maui Wowie boyfriend and Helen and her
Joel now what about your cock

Smell that air

it is my big day
Lenny could i go
Lenny could i go

Long dinner
he is so excited
i helped him make his acceptance speech for the Academy Award

he hopes
i brought you half a steak and fries
i thought you'd be hungry
in a doggy bag
you were invited
you could have come too
you would've loved that would not you
i wanted you to come
so did you fuck him
Lenny do not
you fucked him for dinner and then brought me the leftovers
Stop it
what are you trying to do
Get even
for what
no
i swear i am sorry
i do not know what happened
Coke
i was freebasing with Barbara
i had to get back to work
i was so miserable
i just wanted to make it right again make it like it used to be
Linda
i will never hit you again
i did not mean it
Linda i love you
i know you did not mean it
i love you more than i have ever loved anyone
i feel the same way
do not you know that
I'd never do anything to humiliate you
i am going to make it right again
Sweetheart i really am working on something this time
i was not gonna surprise you
i wanted to tell you
some really big guys guys who think big you know like i do guys from New York who want to set up the right thing in California
i found out from an old contact
you do not know him but i am telling the truth
i did some research on them
it turns out they are in bed with the Saudis
they are buying office buildings shopping centers
i start doing my work i start thinking like
what is their biggest problem
Looking for an angle then it comes to me
a way to structure their deal so it won't look like the Arabs are buying up the country making sure they wind up with the money
here is my idea
i structure this mess of partnerships in which the average American are limited partners with the Saudis who put up lots of money so that mom and pop are at less risk and look like the good guys sharing the opportunities of this great land with the Americans
it is a great great idea
so i got a call in to this main guy
this is my big chance
it is my second chance
i am just a little tense
Sounds like a good idea Lenny
it is going to put me on top again
Come on Tucker
Come on just do it okay
Good boy come on
do it
the phone
Come on
can not you hear the phone
Linda
Advantage Equities
Good morning
Mr Brown

Morning

what did you think
when you do come to town my wife and i would like to take you and your associate Mr Zimmer to be our guests for dinner

it will be great
Well good i will look forward to seeing you then
Thank you Mr McConnell
Billy
Great okay bye bye
they went for it
yeah
they are going to come out
they will drill me for some details then it is business

that is my department
all you got to do is be your beautiful self
Roland
Mr Brown how nice to see you again
how have you been
i need something for tomorrow
it is important
I'd like my old table

i want everything to be perfect
8 00
Right
oh thank you very much
Thank you
we will see you then
Come on
what are you trying to do sabotage me
i want to look pretty
i am trying to make a good impression
should you be doing that
i am just honing the edge a little
i will be fine
my God you are a beautiful woman
Too good for me
Always were and always will be
Even if i owned the world
i will tell you a little secret
i always needed you more than you needed me
Thank you for the lie
i thought you were late
Let's go
Let's rock'n' roll
Good luck you guys
i will take all i can get
Linda you look great
Thanks Mark
when i sold my script
i took a couple of ludes before the meeting to show them i did not rattle
you got to look cool man
you got to give the impression nothing can touch you
Thanks anyway but i do not rattle
all the bad stuff that happened to us it is going to be like it happened to somebody else after tonight
Mrs Brown i heard your husband was a very smart man but until meeting you i had no idea how smart
Why thank you Mr McConnell
you are a lucky man Lenny
what can i say
I'd rather be lucky than smart
yes sir
Good evening
may i help you
yes please
where is Roland
Roland is out sick tonight
may i help you
i am sure he left instructions
my name is Lenny Brown
you made a reservation
this way please
Thank you
here we go
Sir
Sir
Excuse me
is this one of Roland's little jokes
he promised me my usual table
Your usual table
this is where you stick the tourists
do not take me for some asshole
okay
Come on
Sir this is the only table we have available
now if you'd like to wait perhaps an hour
no this is fine
Thanks
Very good
Well here we are
Enjoy your evening
i was a paralegal in New York for 11 years
we have ordered you a martini
Fine
i was telling your lovely wife that i think your concept is brilliant
although i know your focus was on California
i think there is no reason why something like this could not be implemented nationwide
is not that wonderful Lenny
Provided we can minimize the risk to our Saudi friends tax wise especially
if you put enough lawyers and secretaries in a room
i will come up with whatever you need
to the project
we haven't been back to New York since we came out here
Lenny's been so busy
but we do miss it
i suspect you will be getting back there shortly
we have to find a suitable place to celebrate
Lenny have you determined if this is a Section 355 transaction under the new code
what they do not have any lawyers left in New York
yes indeed
i happen to be one myself
Mr Zimmer you are asking Lenny about things that should properly be a part of the fine tuning
Why
we know you are a smart guy
we are talking about staking a lot of money and our reputations on your husband's plan
and everybody knows Lenny's a smart guy too but he is had some problems
i am sorry
Mike's timing's a little off
you want to blame me for an IRS upheaval that decimated the tax shelter business across the country
Fine
i can take this plan to Genstar
we love the idea in its broad strokes but we did a quick background check and there were some rumors
when we all get around the big table and somebody waltzes in starts telling stories about you we'd like to be able to tell him he is full of shit
do not go back to the Arabs who wipe their asses with bare hands have them get the wrong idea
you sit there on your MBA figuring out how to try to steal my idea because maybe i won't fit in your club of Arab fucks
this is not my table
this is his first night
he will be fired
what are you talking about
the table's fine
we are just here to do some business
you have been creaming over my wife while this schmuck humiliates me
i do not need you
i can get plenty of action on this idea
Check
Get me out of this dump
Lenny is not feeling well
they think i am a junkie
i will act like a junkie for them
we may want to come back here
Why do not you go home
we will take a cab
i will drive you
i am your servant
i am supposed to be nice to people like you
his idea is good
do not hold this against
Goddamn it Linda do not grovel
my idea's going to be on the cover of Fortune
you know what these guys will be doing
Carrying around some Arab's dick
you had a deal made
you could've been on your way on your way to New York and something real but you threw it down a rat hole because you can not think anymore
you can not feel
my God you are so fucked up you do not even know the disaster you have caused
i am sorry i lost the baby but you can not punish me any more than i have already punished myself
for God's sakes
Let's call it even
i can not live like this anymore
i am going back to work full time and you are going back into a rehab program
i am not going to watch you kill yourself one minute longer
do you even hear me
Goddamn cunt
i will kill you
Listen I'd like to put a guard on your door
no extra charge
okay
i promised him
i promised him I'd be there
i am sure he made a few promises to you too but you do not want him around right now
it is dangerous for you
are you listening to me
it is dangerous
it is not good for Lenny either
if only we could talk like we used to
i love him so much
i know
God Lenny
who are you
Lenny Brown
my wife's
i want to see her
Please Linda
i am so sorry
who is the guy
Svengali yeah
from day one this airy fairy doctor had this Svengali control over her
Kept me away got her to move in with him
but you know what
she still loves me
she calls me up on the phone asks me how i am says to me Lenny
in that way she used to
i beg her to come back but she says she can not
it is the doctor
he is got this hold on her like Svengali
but Lenny Brown does not give up
one good maneuver and Lenny Brown is back in business
Clean up
Buy a house on the hill with cash
Get some decent wheels and get my girl back
it will be like it all happened to somebody else
i do not know
a couple of years ago i never even thought about tables at Morton's
and then i lose my prospects my girl my wife and God knows what all because i went crazy because i did not get the right table
now what the hell does it mean when you lose everything over nothing
i do not know Lenny
i got to get some capital together
it takes money to make money
which is why i will ask you to leave now
i got a customer coming
is there anything i can do for you
can you bring Linda back
i am just kidding
oh Jesus
it is so nice to see a face from the old days Ned
i won't lie to you
it is hard to concentrate because i kind of miss having her around
i keep turning to her you know to say things
and she is not there
i am sorry
yeah right
i knew from the first time i saw her that if i could ever have her i could never keep her
i always knew
that i would lose her
and i was right was not i
Good bye Lenny
Why the long face
now that you are writing for the Times we will run into each other
L a is a small town
Stick with me
Please
Till i fall off the earth
Napisy pobrane z http napisy org nowa wizja napiswOUR PRlVATE LlVES
i was so worried
Why did not you let me pick you up at the station
Pigheaded
i am here
Calm down
i am so happy
i never thought we would meet in person
me neither
Look
it is right over there
so how was your trip
i am exhausted
i slept in a noisy hotel near the bus station in Montral
i could not sleep for thinking about you so much
you poor boy
you are crazy you live in a forest
Luckily the driver knew the place
Welcome to America bd boy
the house is completely isolated
Perfect for us
now you are my prisoner
should i be afraid
i do not know
Look what i brought you from Bulgaria
for me
are you nervous
i do not know are you
a little
Seeing each other for the first time
you are even more beautiful in person
Thank you
3 weeks alone with me will you tough it out
do you like the merchandise
i regret it already
where can i get a refund
you are ridiculous with your Bulgarian flag on your luggage
i am a proud globe trotter
do you still feel Bulgarian
of course
but watch out i am becoming more of a Quebecker
should i be wary of people from Quebec
Definitely
they bite they swear they can surprise you and devour you
they hide in this lake be careful
should not we kiss

yes
Open up
we are completely alone here

yes
Really
Thanks for inviting me
are there wild animals in this forest
i will protect you
she was so obese i was afraid she would sit next to me
so naturally that is what happened
a real motor mouth
she tried speaking French then English
i pretended not to understand
she carried a box with her cat in it
you could tell she was terrified of flying
the plane took off and i hear her start vomiting
Threw up in the sick bag without being able to stop
when the bag overflowed she threw up in the cat's box
the cabin crew had to take care of her and clean off the cat
there are no curtains in the room
i will put some up
he has many talents
have any others
Picking up girls on the internet
Interesting
what do you offer them
this magnificent body
Planning on falling in love this week
with who
you are killing me with your questions
what did you think when you first saw me
what did you think when you first saw me
i am not going back to Bulgaria
Alright
Later i will introduce you to Ste Mlanie
Beg your pardon
the village
Very well
i will trade Sofia for Slmini
i can not find my camera
Get up
i want to photograph you
do some poses like Kate Moss
this is the best i can do
okay then do Zinedine Zidane
is it true you speak French
but of course
French is so sexy
Keep going i am getting a nosebleed
i love your little hand
i love your little mouth
i love your little cock
Wait
what did you say you witch
i will tell everyone what a bad lover you are that you are impotent
Wait
Wait
Go slowly
Teach me
okay
the mouth
the eyes
the arms
the hands
the feet
the brain
the balls
the pussy
the poetry
French is a magical language
Why are you laughing
it is funny
hello mom
i am with Isabelle
we rented a house near Sherbrooke
with Isabelle
i told you
we are spending 3 weeks in the countryside
it is not isolated
there are neighbours
the town is nearby
do not worry about us
it is not that i do not want to see you
we stay up late
we sleep in late
you would not enjoy it
3 weeks
it is not that long
i will call you back
Promise
and you
how are you
Good
Good
Perfect
i will phone you
you lie to your mother
she doesn't need to know that i am crazy enough to stay alone in the forest with a crazy Bulgarian photographer
i met in an online chat room
that is none of her business
what did i say to catch your attention in the chat room
i do not know
you were so silly and perverted
you only talked about your cock
and you
Sure but i must have said something you liked
Probably 6 months later here we are
i was floored when i first saw you on webcam
i thought you were gorgeous
i sent you a pic before no
no
i remember you asked me why i would need to use a chat room to meet men
i did not know what to answer but was thinking the same thing
i really fell in love with you when i saw you cry on your cam 2 months ago
oh please
that is the truth
those are just internet games
do not use big words like Love
we are still strangers do not you think
i do not
we are here together it must mean something
Maybe
Maybe
Please do not complicate things
do you have your bathing suit
yes
you
yes
Get undressed
Why
Come on i want to see
you first
Remember the first time you showed me your breasts on camera
Why are not you undressing
i do not have my bathing suit
Poetry poetry
i love Ste Mlanie the view is amazing
i thought the sky was blue but it is definitely pink
Pervert
Perverts are dangerous i am not
Perverts do not like pink skies as much as i do
do you see any clouds in those pink skies
no
it is a magnificent sky
the weather is perfectly clear
do not you think we should do something
Like what
i am perfectly happy doing nothing
i am relaxing
i am falling in love
we are here all cooped up
i thought photographers were curious
there is a museum near here
a museum
the Museum of Natural Wonders is free and open 24H a day
do not be so sure
there could be a strike at any given moment
not a chance
the employees are satisfied
how much for this museum
it is free for hotties who are Fine Arts students
oh
it is the rear end of Philip's brain
hello Philip
how are you today
Lovely day is not it
i can not believe you are speaking French to my butt and drawing things on it
can we really do nothing with all this time
are you bored
you miss your mom and your big city
no not at all
so
where is the problem
what an idea to fall in love with some guy on the internet
one who lives on the other side of the planet
Recently i have been having the same strange dream
i am with a very pretty girl
Young
15 ou 16
we are in a big department store very luxurious
5 or 6 floors
we are in a long corridor our eyes meet
she starts walking away
i follow her mesmerized
she goes into the men's room
i often dream of this
and then
i follow her and we screw
that is what you dream about
Maybe 2 or 3 times in the past month
was it difficult to pay for your trip here
Photographers are not rich
but i managed
Thanks
Why
Thanks for being here
how is Sofia
Still the same
more people
more cars
more gas stations
more murders
i am sure you heard about them
the Dimitrov Mausoleum was demolished
i know
it is better that way
how many times did you try to meet girls in chat
that is a bit of a cruel question
i have a right to ask
so
Why do you want to know
what does it change
do you feel betrayed
no
i am happy you showed up
i do not regret a thing
i told you you'd like it here
i like these kinds of places
and you
not so much as before
you do not have many friends in Montral
not really
i go out with museum colleagues
i think they are my only friends
i am a loner
i read a lot
Mom is happy and i am happy for her
she sees a rich old guy in secret
she thinks i do not know
I'd love to meet her
Sorry
when will you introduce her
have you travelled much
yes
i lived a month in Chicago in 1998
i had a big contract there
so what is Chicago like
Big
Big
that is all you can say
and the girls in Chicago
they are okay
Entertaining
Entertaining
they are candid with strong personalities but are not sexy
and clearly you like them sexy
Chicago is surely no different than Montral
i know
i was just curious
you would enchant them
who
all of Chicago
Like a witch
yes
Like a Bulgarian witch with your long black hair naked on your broom casting curses on passersby
Ste Perptue Pig Festival

Kiss a girl

how did i let you talk me into seeing Return of Astro Mutt
Space Dog of the Future and like twice
he is my hero
Hey the Mystery Machine
i guess Fred is coming to give us a ride home
Hey Fred
i wonder why he is not stopping
there is no Fred
in fact there is no driver
Like the Mystery Machine it is after us
my van
yeah
Scoob and i were walking along minding our own business when it tried to run us over and there was no one driving
Come on Shaggy that could not happen
i do not know Velma
Maybe i left the parking brake off
Parking brake
no way man
that thing was alive
and there was this creepy green glow and scary music playing
Come on i will show you
but
but it was alive
what a joker
Very funny Shaggy
Come on you two
it is getting late
what the heck
the steering wheel won't budge
Hit the brakes Freddy
they are not working either
Zoinks
Like look
what are you pointing at Scooby
Good idea
the Mystery Machine parachute
one more tenth of a second and
Cement City
did not you just take the Mystery Machine in for a tune up
i sure did
Well i think Murph the mechanic could use a refresher course
first thing in the morning we are gonna pay him a visit
i am sorry but when your van left here it was in perfect condition
i even checked the brakes myself
they were fine
Well they weren't fine last night
Well i will tell you what i will do
the Mystery Machine is getting up there in miles
how about i take it off your hands
i will give you 5000 for it
we are not here to sell it
besides what would we ever do without the Mystery Machine
Get a Mystery SUV
what is up Scooby Doo
the Mystery Machine
oh no
the Mystery Machine was stolen
Like stolen by a ghost
yeah
Quit it with that ghost nonsense
this is serious
Luckily for us it started leaking oil after that near miss we had last night
Just follow the gooey drip road
the trail ends right here
and not a haunted van in sight
we need to find out who lives at this house
no problem
Using my wireless Internet connection i will do a reverse search on the address
Hey wait for me
Well i am always happy to talk to the press but i am in the middle of a piano lesson
Why do not you wait in there
okay
Keep playing doll
the keyboard's just a little out of tune that is all
the Mystery Kids
Whatever happened to that band
they sure were popular
and they are going to be again
you must be the Mystery Kids' biggest fan Susan
i am not a fan
i am their mother and i am a very busy woman
this interview can not take too long
we are not reporters
we are actually here about our van the Mystery Machine
you own the Mystery Machine
Well that used to be our tour bus when we were first starting out
since they were the Mystery Kids we called the van the Mystery Machine
what are you kids doing
Tennis tryouts are next week
hello
i am looking for my prom dress
what
we have got an album to finish and a concert at City Park tomorrow night
oh Mom
do not you give me that lip
now sit up straight
we have guests
Andy and Mandy meet the new owners of the Mystery Machine
i thought Mom sold it for scrap parts
is that thing still running
yeah except now it is running on ghost power
Shaggy likes to exaggerate
Let's just say some strange things have been happening that we can not yet explain
is there anything you can tell us about it that might help
Well technically the van was owned by our keyboard player Flash Flannigan
do you think we could talk to Flash
not unless you have got a Ouija board
Andrew
Flash
Well Flash had an accident after one of the concerts
and now he is in rock'n' roll heaven
Rock'n' Roll Heaven that could be a song
Write it down
Man
Like now i know what is wrong with the Mystery Machine
the ghost of Flash Flannigan is haunting it
it was like his home away from home
he even painted it to remind him of the flowers in his garden
so Flash Flannigan painted the Mystery Machine
i thought the flower pattern was your idea Fred
Nope
i always wanted to paint it red
Why do not you watch where you are going
who are you
i am Randy
Randy Dinwiddie
Andy and Mandy's brother
oh
a Flight Engineering
Sixth Edition
this is a great book
where do you study
at Defries Technical Academy and now you have made me late for class
that is strange
Susan did not even mention that Andy and Mandy have a brother
Like we have got to find some alternate means of transport
this walking is for the birds
Gotta think fast
the whole box Scooby all for you
now go get it
Like i hate to say we told you so but
we told you so
Jeepers
the Mystery Machine really is haunted
the way i see it there is only one way to solve this mystery
Follow that van
Darn
Looks like we lost it
Defries Technical Academy
Hey that is the school Randy Dinwiddie attends
i wonder if he is here
then we lost its trail right around here
Why would it come to this school Randy
how should i know
i never had anything to do with the Mystery Kids
i am just their tone deaf brother
i do not count
These robotic appendages are quite remarkable but where are the control panels
Control panels
with wireless Internet technology i can make the robots execute a complex sequence of commands from right here
Great work
Your mother must be very proud
yeah right
she pretends to take an interest helps me with my homework or whatever but it is just a show
i will never make the charts like her precious Mystery Kids
you are a smart guy Randy
what would you do if your van started driving itself all over town
I'd find myself a good mechanic
Murph
Murph you here
it was not until we got the Mystery Machine back that it acted funny
if you think this is funny I'd hate to see what your idea of hilarious is
and why did he try and buy it from us when we were at the garage
that is obvious
because it is a sweet ride
Wow
Murph is a secret Mystery Kids fan
i will say
Looks like he cornered the Mystery Kids collectibles market
Look at this stuff
Hey check it out
Andy and Mandy make dandy candy
that is handy
we now return to Rewind the Music
Rise and Fall of the Mystery Kids
it was there at the infamous City Park concert that Flash Flannigan stormed off stage and vanished into rock'n' roll legend
but behind he left one final mystery
each week a wild daisy appears on Flash's headstone the gift of an obsessed fan or a calling card from Flash himself
Sounds like strange things are happening at Flash Flannigan's grave
Let's check it out
but how are we going to get there
we are almost to Flash Flannigan's grave now
Hold up
Someone's there
Andy and Mandy
but what are they doing here
Come on gang
Let's follow them
i do not suppose that could be some other van that plays Mystery Kids hits could it
the Mystery Machine's got Shaggy
here goes
be careful Freddy
i am coming Shag
Hang in there
Stop
Wait
Zoinks
Shaggy
yes
what is going on buddy
Where'd you get your license clown school
we weren't driving officer
Come on fellows
that van can not drive itself
you can believe him officer
the van has been acting weird all week
Well looks like no one got hurt
we will call it a malfunction let you off with a warning
but we will have to impound your vehicle
you might consider keeping it in solitary
Pick up the pace kids
it is not a lullaby and i am snoozing
Hey
Like we did not think we'd see you here tonight
Mom said if i did not set up a controlled lighting display for the show she'd stop paying my tuition
Excuse me
there is a rehearsal going on here
Authorized personnel only
Murph
oh
Hey
we know why you are here Murph
Well yeah looking for you
so all i have gotta say is 2500 plus impound and towing fees
Take it or leave it
and we know why you want it
we happened to see your shrine
what
you saw it
we sure did
okay i admit it
i have been into them for years
it is not something i am proud of
Promise you won't tell anybody cool
what the heck happened Randy
i do not know
i was not even near that light
i am so sure
Mom Randy's trying to wreck our show
there could have been a fire
no way
that is a fireproof curtain
it is lined with lead
i said i did not do it
Well if Randy did not then who did
Maybe it was the ghost of Flash Flannigan
i doubt that very highly
but that gives me an idea
Why do not we let Flash himself clear up this mystery
how
Daphne's going to hold a sance
Like what is a sance and is it catered
a sance is where you contact spirits from beyond the grave
Grave
now we are going to find out who is really haunting the Mystery Machine
Thank you all for coming
we are gathered tonight to contact the spirit of Flash Flannigan
i am the great Madame Daphne
where did you learn to contact spirits
an informercial on the Psychic Channel
Watch this
Spirits make this table rise
Thank you spirits
you are welcome
the spirit of Flash Flannigan is near
where
Like i am deep in the ground
but i am also in the air and maybe even in the cosmos
Flash we need your help
Tell us who has corrupted the Mystery Machine
was it Andy or Mandy to hype the Mystery Kids
Randy to get revenge on his ungrateful siblings
Murph to get us to sell
Wow i am good
Like everybody run
it stopped
how come
that lead lined curtain is keeping wireless commands from getting to its computers
and my guess is the person sending those commands is sitting right at this table
Susan Dinwiddie
Mom
Susan wanted the Mystery Kids to be back on top of the music world
so she came up with this publicity stunt to get attention for their concert
that is why she helped Randy with his homework
so she could learn to control the Mystery Machine with wireless commands
when the Mystery Machine was at Murph's for repairs Susan planted a web cam and receiver in the dashboard
that meant she could control it from anywhere
Scooby why do not you show us how it is done
okay
Like it is that ghoulie greenish glow
Relax Shaggy
they are just green Christmas tree lights hooked into the battery
but Andy and Mandy why were you hanging out at Flash Flannigan's grave
Flash was our hero and with our upcoming comeback we missed him
we were just visiting the grave
but my favorite clue is that sour note that came from the van
it is the same out of tune sound that came from Susan Dinwiddie's keyboard
that means she must have recorded that eerie score and not Flash Flannigan
Well i never meant for the van to get so out of control but you kids would not stop meddling
it doesn't matter though
the Mystery Kids are still gonna be bigger than ever
Sorry Mom but the Mystery Kids are calling it quits
what
Lf being famous again means having to go through all this we are totally happy being has beens
Sorry we were so hard on you Randy
from now on all of us kids are so sticking together
it is nice having the good old Mystery Machine back on our side 8000 and that is my final offer
it is not for sale Murph
no way
i wonder if they still want those instruments
Like great way to celebrate getting our Mystery Machine back by taking it to the movies
the Mystery Machine is alive

Scoob and i will catch up with you guys later
where did you come up with the idea for a combination roller coaster and all you can eat buffet
it just came to me man
Well all you can Hurl is gonna be a great ride
this is as cool as anything my sister's ever designed
Chris comes up with all the ideas
i figure out how to build them make them safe and publicize them
the buffet line will be the entrance to the ride and the tracks start here
Up there is the Pizza Pie Peak
and that is the Deviled Egg Drop
it is okay
i like saved the sandwich
what do you mean you have to be at least this tall to ride
yeah i do not make the rules kid
Sorry

Well at least we do not have to wait in long lines
so what happens now
you will see
yes

Skydiving just rocks
Jinkies

the fan's slowing down
we are falling
we have got to jam the fan
but how
Good thinking Daphne
that belt did not work with this outfit anyway
you kids all right
Barely
the ride broke down
i can not believe it happened again
Again
first it was the parasail then the cliff diving simulator now this
Sir
Sorry call me Sam
i am the safety engineer
when the rides are not up to snuff i shut them down
that is been happening a lot lately
yeah since that gremlin of a ghost started showing up
Ghost
Well folks call it the Roller Ghoster
never seen it myself
Whatever did this was not a ghost
i never cared for these new fangled extreme rides anyway
Bungee jumping thrashing skydiving
now what is fun about that
because skydiving is awesome
Until the fan breaks
that is the problem
they are too dangerous too high tech
the old classic rides were better
oh i used to enjoy seeing the kids on Mr Snail's Brisk Walk
Well girls looks like we have got a mystery on our hands
i will say
Let's split up
Velma you go and see if the sisters know about this Roller Ghoster
Right
and Fred and i will take a closer look at some of these rides
Strange things have been happening here
if you are not careful the next ride could be your last
Terry
Chris
Looks like they ditched us Scoob
Wanna hit some rides until they show up again
okay
what do you mean i am too short
how tall do you have to be to stand in a ball
Sorry kid
not as sorry as you are gonna be

Well i
this is Harry Harrison crusading reporter for this ride stinks
Com
i am webcasting from the Thrill Rides theme park talking to Chris about persistent rumors that the park is haunted
Chris
it is not haunted you muckraking loser
how do you explain the so called accidents
we are very sorry about that
we are doing everything we can to make the rides safe
how do we know you are not responsible
would not a big expos about a haunted park increase traffic on your website
Sure blame the media
Keep running

Think you could run faster for a Scooby snack
yeah
two Scooby snacks
yeah yeah yeah
what happened to you guys
Monster

Wasting time

yeah
Give me that it is mine
i did not do it
it is just my wrench
you do not have to say another word
but
Come on
where are we going
to get some answers
Remember the piece of green fur i found
it proves something very important
what is that
Easy
it is artificial fur
which proves the Roller Ghoster is just someone in a costume
someone like Harry
someone like scary
i need one last thing to confirm my theory
Chris
yeah
where do you have the broken rides fixed
Sam
now this was a good ride
it was real fun for the kids
Safe too if they did not jump around too much
they do not make them like this anymore
that is why you did it is not it
what
you hate new rides
it would be easy for you to sabotage them
it is not him Fred
i know it
it is not
oh my bad
the rides weren't really sabotaged
they were just gimmicked to look sabotaged
Right Sam
Right
they looked broken but when i went to fix them they were completely safe
that means my theory is probably right
we will need to catch our ghost red handed to be sure
i have got just the plan
all i need is for someone to be the bait
Hey why is everybody looking at us
Really is there anything we won't do for Scooby snacks
Well Scoob i guess that wraps up the case
now that we know who the Roller Ghoster is there is nothing left to do but call the police from the pay phones near the skate park
Like how'd i do
so so
Stay alert Scoob
now that the Roller Ghoster thinks we are onto him he will be after us
it is all over Roller Ghoster
Time to unmask your monstrous mayhem
you lost your wrench at the Rocket Coaster
that is not all
it was not green fur we found at the Sky Ride it was hair from a green wig
all of which proves that the Roller Ghoster is really Chris
Terry
Just as i suspected
but why would my own sister frame me
Maybe because she was jealous
it is true
i always did all the work bringing your crazy designs to life never getting to build any of my own
Did i ever get any credit or even a thank you
i never thought about it like that
you never thought at all
you were easy to frame
Too easy
that is what tripped you up
the wrench was way too obvious a clue
and the green fur green hair thing
Please
Sort of a green herring
never go for green herring man
it is not fresh
Once Sam confirmed that the sabotaged rides were still safe everything pointed to Terry who wanted to make sure no one really got hurt
and after her sister was blamed Terry would control the park
she could build whatever she wanted
i would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids
Technically you did get away with it
Velma's right
you did not do anything illegal
Just rude
i am very disappointed in you Terry
i am telling Mom
no wait a minute
Let's not be hasty
Mom doesn't need to know about this
Chris wait
so how come i was not a suspect
you are too short to wear the costume
oh man
but you know what you are not too short for
Thanks Shaggy
no problem pal
Hold on tight
yeah
Hey we are landing in a giant hot fudge sundae
yeah the best rides today are like interactive
we have to eat our way out
Scooby Dooby Doo
Subtitles by SDI Media Group
what in the world's that sound
it is not of this world
it is the demons
Great Scott they are stalking us
Run
so this is Africa
Looks more like Cincinnati
there are modern cities all over Africa Shaggy
Zomba's airport is near the Hatari Game Preserve
and that is where our video safari begins
Imagine
Real lions elephants cheetahs zebras
Up until now i have only met the animal cracker kind
many species are vanishing from this part of Africa
and not just the endangered ones
i wanted to go on this trip and put them on tape while we still can
and cut
okay try another take girls
with a little more sincerity
Freddy please save your video vrit for the animals
Sorry
Guess i am eager to try out the new attachments
Letterbox panoramic framing
Sweet
Too bad it cuts off your heads
Like Fred at least i won't have to worry about smiling with my mouth full
there will be plenty of time to tape us at the safari
Excuse me you are on the safari
yep
we are gonna video the big game
Except for maybe the taller giraffes
Well we are on it too
it is a thrilling trip
we have done it three times before
you could call this our fourth honeymoon
i am Honey Hunsecker and this is my husband Henry
hi
Henry and Honey Hunsecker
Like i just had to say that myself
we are Fred Velma Daphne Shaggy and Scooby Doo
Documentarians extraordinaire
have you heard the rumors that there might be trouble with the animals vanishing
Trouble
not a word
the worst you have to worry about might be the instant changes in weather
Hatari that is an interesting word
it means danger in Swahili
Zoinks
Why did not we pick a place that means teens eat free
which reminds me i packed a sandwich
Hey fellas back off
Wait
this is my only pre lunch snack
Wow
Animals already
Except i did not realize there'd be so many bugs
and the humidity's totaled my hair
Better get used to it
it is 800 miles to the next salon
Good thing i brought my own
Provides a firm hold and kills insects
Jocko
where are you Jocko
have you seen Jocko
he is about this high fuzzy
oh there you are
we will be joining your safari
Name's Lloyd Mbuku
i am in the souvenir T shirt game
and of course that is Jocko
Jocko
Mr and Mrs Hunsecker
hi Cap N'
Folks meet Cap N' Robbie Kumbazi from Capetown College
Ahoy Cap N'
so you will take us down the river
i plan to but you guys have come at kind of a bad time
i thought we beat the monsoons
Lf only it were just that
the animals on the preserve seem to be thinning out
yes we have heard about your endangered species
it is stranger than that
Dr Goodfew traveled out here to try and figure out what is going on
Joan Goodfew
the famous zoologist
i have been tagging the animals to track their habits
but lately all i am finding are the tags and no animals
it is awful
Good thing you are here
Wish i could say the same about you
i believe that civilization is frightening creatures away
i frown on video safaris
Frown
no smile
Guess she hasn't heard about the demon warnings
what demon warnings
i haven't listened to the news today
Stories have come from the Ocuzi River about shape shifting jungle demons
Supposedly angered by the animals' disappearance they attack in the form of mysterious ferocious beasts
Mysterious
Who'd have thought we'd find a mystery as far away as Africa
i guess leaving is out of the question
the animals are in trouble
Maybe our documentary could help in some way
i am happy to take you downriver
i just can not promise you what to expect
Well we are going too
i have my big strong fella to protect me
no need to worry
me and my boat never go west of the Ocuzi
Oops
much better
okay look lazy
no problem
this is not so bad
Snacks cool breezes and the CD i burned of my favorite tunes
and like best of all no dangerous jungle beasts
Sunset on the Ocuzi River
nothing like it eh Henry
Makes me feel warm and fuzzy
Let's hope the animals stay that way too
i have been searching the shore for animal populations
so far nothing
they were thriving a few months ago
where could they have gone
Wish i knew
we will reach a veldt in the morning that attracts creatures from miles around
Nice hat Daph
now your outfit's complete
Sure is
Look what i came up with
Bug blinds
Yikes
Double yikes
Great fear reaction guys
Let's go for the reverse angle
i got some great shots with this infrared night scope feature
Hey wait a minute
Look at this
do you think that is a shape shifting jungle demon
Hard to tell
what is that
Like whatever that is it is from the scary side of the river
Keep calm
i am steering away
the rapids
they are too strong
we are off course
we are heading for Kamahara Falls
i need help
we did it
we are safe
yes
we are safe we are safe
do you realize where we are
we are stranded
on land west of the Ocuzi River
Like we are not so safe
Hey
you made it
so did you
Great
yeah
Great
what about the Hunseckers
Haven't seen them
Hope they are all right
i found them
we just wanted a moment to reminisce
that catastrophe reminded us of our wedding night at Niagara Falls
those people are so darn chipper
i found this wallet
Belongs to Mr Mbuku
Hey
i am glad we all survived the river
Normally we'd be eaten by crocodiles
Like that is one meal i can live without
Animals
but there is something strange
Why are they glowing
they are demons
Let's get out of here
do we have a map
we lost the maps in the rapids
if we follow the river back we should get to the preserve
there are more and more things that need to be explained
Well here is another one
that T shirt salesman Mbuku
inside his wallet there is a police badge
are we there yet
we have only been walking for 15 minutes
Seems like forever
this place needs a c
it is too hot
yeah
Too hot
there is a watering hole
with animals
oh look dear
Showtime
Let's keep our distance
do not frighten them
yeah
but how do we keep them from frightening us
do not worry
they are herbivores
you know vegetarians
not Shagatarians
Looks like they are pretty friendly
we finally found some wildlife
but at a big watering hole like this there should be lots more than two
there certainly should
Dr Goodfew
how did you get here
i am following the river searching for any remaining animals
at least these two are all right
but their herds are drastically thin
do you believe this demon story
i believe that animals are shrinking from the invasion of modern life
Your serve
i frown on fraternization between man and beast
Just once she could smile
Kind of a coincidence that she'd be here in the lands of the demon legend
it is too hot to proceed any further
Let's rest and resume walking after it cools off tonight
and cut
Very real
Very convincing
and a good idea
Game called on account of demons
Hanging our things from vines
Great idea Daphne
i remembered it from Bonfire Girls
Keeps everything safe from mud moisture and soldier ants
not to mention lions leopards and snakes
oh my
that is not what we have to worry about here
but for a place that is scarce on animals it is odd there are so many bugs
if there were this many bugs where i lived like I'd be scarce too
Yikes
the demons of the jungle are back
everyone split up
Jinkies
if anyone asks whether demon animals are shape shifting here i have the answer
i am not so sure that is what is happening
one thing i am sure of is that we are lost in the middle of a huge thick jungle
Excuse me Cap N'
i thought you said we did not have a map
i was saving it for an emergency
so i guess this emergency tops all our other emergencies
Why did not you tell us you had it
okay it is a map of this side of the river
i have a claim to a secret uranium field on this land
you own uranium and you are still piloting a riverboat
one feeds the pocket the other feeds the soul
now that we are hopelessly lost i guess we will be using your secret map
you can put your thumb over the uranium part
i can not find Jocko anywhere
my monkey's missing
Zoinks
so is Scooby
Scooby
Scooby Doo where are you
Jocko
Jocko
Perhaps now would be a good time to tell us why a T shirt salesman is carrying a police badge
you know
yes and now we need to know why
i am actually Sergeant Inspector Mbuku Malawi Police
i am investigating the animals disappearing
Why did not you just tell us that
i am undercover
Look
Jocko
down down boy
Ten little monkeys jumping on the bed
Like this is no time for joking around
we have gotta find Scooby
he is my best friend
I'd hardly call that joking
i have an idea
Good going Velma
when he can not hear that weird music he is back to normal
Why is he still glowing
Complexion glow with aloe
a great makeup base on Halloween
Scooby
he wants you to follow him
he can lead us to Scooby
where are you old buddy old pal old friend
the shape shifters we were warned about are real animals covered with makeup
and hyped up by that weird music
who would perform such dastardly deeds
Look we are back at the river
Hey what is that boat doing here
Good question
Dr Goodfew
is that your cargo boat
i was about to ask you the same thing
it gives me the willies
i think we should just leave it be
is Scooby on that boat
could be
i think we should go aboard and explore
Scoob is that you
they are here
and the animals from the watering hole
Help
Coming Scoob
Scooby
Shaggy
i have a feeling i know who is behind all this
them
Just stand still Henry
you both are under arrest
a monkey family reunion
Why would this nice couple take all the animals
Stealing innocent animals out of the jungle
it must be for their own gain
that is it
they are poachers
we do not harm any of them
there are lots of rich people in the States who want exotic pets
Treating these beautiful beasts as pets would harm them all
Thanks to you we won't have to worry about that any longer
Velma and i figured out why there were so many bugs and no animals
Bugs are impervious to sound and this sound controlled the animals
oh get away from him you floozy
These two were a little too lovey dovey
that is because Honey operated a remote transmitter on Henry's shoulder which activated broadcasting equipment on that boat
the flute music fed into that demon's myth and covered that buzzing sound which was geared to hypnotize animals
so that is how they could attract animals and make them act strange and scary
yeah and even shy snooty and silly
Come on you two
See how you like being stuck in the hold
i told you those kids were meddling
no i told you
we should have gone back to Niagara Falls
the only thing we can poach there is eggs
we should be upriver by nightfall
Well Fred once again you are our hero
we should have a great documentary about saving animals
no you are the hero Daphne
Nabbing the Hunseckers
Why did you think they were the culprits
with all the bugs snakes blistering heat humidity and flesh eating plants it is great for adventure but not for romantic honeymoons
Yikes
not again
Hey man would you look at that
they are performing for our video
that is it
Energy
Energy
Act natural
do you know what they are saying

Subtitles by SDI Media Group
from making the city of Pacoima California disappear to being encased for a week in a giant cube of gelatin Rufus Raucous has made magic crazy fresh for a new generation of fans
now strapped to the Wheel of Misfortune by his lovely assistant Phylidia he will attempt a daring escape from inside this historic Las Vegas hotel as it is demolished by a 10 ton wrecking ball
i am Nancy Chang with the exclusive live report
Rufus Raucous is still inside
this is horrible
Stop the camera
Stop the camera
here we are gang
Las Vegas Nevada
we get to see the Eiffel Tower the Venice canals and ancient Rome without going to Europe
Like i have never seen so many all you can eat buffets
Viva Las Vegas
yeah viva Las Vegas
Look at all the shops
there is a world class art collection a Broadway style theater
Hey it is Rats
the Musical
Vegas has some of the best Elvis impersonators in the world
Hey thank you ma'am
Thank you very much
my sunglasses
but i can not do my Elvis without them
Really
Darn these fragile imported sunglasses
Hey there is our destination
Newark Newark Las Vegas' first New Jersey themed resort
i am guessing it is Las Vegas' only New Jersey themed resort
and the site of the biggest concert event of the year
Teen pop sensation Lindsay Pagano's headlining debut which we just so happen to have backstage passes for
Thanks to Shaggy and Scooby
you really wanted to go backstage and meet Lindsay
no Fred we want to go backstage and eat the catering spread
you must be our lucky radio contest winners
Welcome to Newark Newark
i am Del Stone
i run the joint
Thanks for having us Mr Stone
i am curious Mr Stone
what made you decide on a New Jersey theme
Somebody already had a pirate ship hotel so we went with our second choice
now that makes perfect sense
it is a joke kid
Well shall we
everything about this theater is state of the art
Except for the name the Spectacular Spackle Dome
Corporate sponsorship
Believe it or not spackle is one of Newark's biggest exports
that is a good one Mr Stone
that was not a joke son
we do our best to respect the whole Newark theme
Like are creepy black cats a part of the theme
Darn cat
it seemed to vanish under that statue
Like make that a floating statue
Floating statue
Guys it is a statue of the late great magician Rufus Raucous
Levitating was his signature trick
no wires
that kid was the greatest showman I'd known since Elvis
you knew Elvis
Rufus was supposed to be the Spackle Dome's main attraction
the theater was designed specifically to house his show
Sadly it was not to be
Why do not you go in and check out rehearsal
i have got to see a maintenance man about a vanishing cat
Disappearing black cats
Spooky dead magicians
i do not think our luck could get any worse Scoob
or maybe it could
Talk about a lavish production
Get out
it is part of the show
Just a big scary face on the monitor
that can shoot fireballs
it looks like Rufus Raucous
or his ghost
on that note like good night everybody
Well whatever it is it is not a Lindsay Pagano fan
Well that was totally weird
it looked like Rufus Raucous' ghost
you really think it was a ghost
i do not know
by the way i am Fred
this is Daphne Velma Shaggy and Scooby Doo
we are the lucky contest winners
Actually i am the lucky one
i mean you saved my life
i am going to get lunch in a little bit
Want to join me
no thanks
i just ate an energy bar
i am super full
the ghost again
Let's get out of here
it is Fate's Fools
Flapjack B Ball and Timmy
they are only my favorite boy band in the whole world
they are my opening act
what is with all the flappity lip
we are trying to kick it and you peeps are bumming our Van Winkles with this bogus woofering and tweetering
what did he say
it is too noisy out here
we are trying to rest our vocal chords for the show
i will try to keep it down the next time a ghost tries to kill me
Shiver me timbers
is everyone all right
i heard there was a disturbance
Lindsay's all wiggity with the boo hoo
might be funkalicious if me and my boys headline in her place
Nice try Flapjack
i would not give up my first headlining gig in Vegas because of a stupid ghost
there won't be any show
i am canceling it until we discover who or what is responsible for this damage
my show just can not get canceled
we will ferret out the ghost
we have solved a few mysteries in our day
that is so generous and brave of you
Look Scoob the green room
Maybe that is where they keep like salads and vegetables
the ghost
what is up guys
Like we are
the ghost brought these cables to life
a cable that leaks water
Interesting
Like that ghost was hovering over there near the rack of costumes
Like the ghost has got Scooby
no the floor does
the metal on his collar is stuck
it is like the floor is magnetized
the cable that snagged Shaggy and Scooby is hydraulic
when water is forced through it it moves
this theater was designed for Rufus Raucous remember
These illusions are probably built right in
Italian silk
Jeepers
the mask the ghost was wearing
Whoever was wearing it ditched it so they could slip out of the theater unnoticed
or blend in with the people inside
Like a certain boy band that wanted to steal the top spot from my friend Lindsay who lets me borrow her clothes
Go for it girl
i have got doubles
Love you
Hey what about Del Stone
Like why would he want to sabotage his own theater
Del Stone doesn't own this place
he is just the manager
he was losing his shirt and he sold to a big conglomerate
Perhaps Mr Stone wants to ruin the hotel out of spite
there is one sure way to find out
Let's split up gang
Shaggy Scooby and i will check out Mr Stone
Great
and Lindsay Velma and i can check out some shops
Excuse me Mr Stone
Looks like Mr Stone is trying to give us the slip
i suddenly have a craving for steamed dumplings
who is that
he can not see us
if i disguise my voice i can pump him for info
Thank you
Thank you very much
Engelbert Humperdinck
yeah
i tell you Eng Vegas has changed
i have got to sneak away just to take a steam bath
i know what you mean boss
Viva Las Vegas
Kicking it old school
T C B Taking care of business
Boy you said it Eng
you know anything about this ghost business with that magician fellow
that is no ghost
Rufus Raucous would have to be dead to be a ghost
what
he is not dead
who is that
Hey dogs are not allowed in here
Dog
and neither are nosy kids
and your Engelbert Humperdinck impression stinks
so did you girls find anything
Look what i got
i could not resist
there she is
Rufus Raucous' former assistant Phylidia Flanders
Please welcome the comedy magic stylings of Mr Wacky Pants
Ladies and gentlemen and you know which you are
i learned everything i know about magic from my ex wife you see
she made my bank account my car and my house disappear
now i will need two volunteers
Like we haven't had a bite all day
Well here you go then
the human puzzle box
now now now do not look so worried
Only thing i ever made vanish was my hair
Watch the stomach
it is my best feature
Seriously i just got this trick
i need help
so do we
Faked his death
no
Rufus could not walk away from the spotlight
he loved magic too much
he would not have left me to scrape out a living with a hack like Wacky Pants
Hey i resemble that remark
and what is this
more kooks who think Rufus Raucous is still alive
he is just jealous
Once Rufus came on the scene guys like Wacky Pants went out of fashion quickly
Look Rufus is not coming back
here this ought to convince you
it is the footage from his last stunt
Guys
a little help please
there is no way he got out
can you play that last part again Velma
Like what is that
it is a little line around computer generated effects
sometimes you see it in music videos
so maybe that is not real concrete falling down on Rufus
if it is layered over the original image i should be able to strip it away
Hey it is a digital image
Look he went through the floor
this must have been prerecorded before the building actually came down
and they spliced it into the broadcast so it looked like it was happening live
Remember how Scooby chased that cat and it just vanished under the statue
Maybe that is where the trapdoor is
Fred you may be onto something
Look gang
a dark spooky tunnel
Dark and spooky
no good ever comes from dark and spooky
Guys it is a mannequin of the great Houdini the famous illusionist
do you guys see all this old magic stuff
See with your eyes not with your hands
those things are priceless
Like it is the ghost of Rufus Raucous
it is Rufus Raucous
Hey you are Lindsay Pagano
Right on
you are not trying to keep her from performing in your theater
my theater
you mean that fun house upstairs
no
i am not about that kind of stuff
that is why i left to get back to street magic
i have got some amazing tricks in the works
Well like if you are the real Rufus Raucous then who is that
Thank you ladies and germs
for my first illusion i shall make the audience disappear
Phylidia is working for Mr Wacky Pants
that jerk was after my secrets for years
with Phylidia at his side he may finally have them
but he doesn't seem to use them
Unless he is saving them for a surprise appearance at the Spackle Dome
there is one way to find out
we will have to set a trap
Rufus you up for it
a chance to save Phylidia from Mr Wacky Pants
Definitely
Count me in
Majorly un diggity
Someone's gonna pay for this
Rufus Raucous the magician the world watched perish on this site will return tonight seemingly from the dead
is this for real
i do not know
but i do know i reported it first
Velma you ready
i am not coming out
Just follow my lead
you will be fine
Please welcome the one the only Rufus Raucous
i do not blame you for doubting it is me but i intend to prove it the only way i know how by astounding you using only a deck of cards and my bare hands
Sorry
could you pick those up Velma
now nothing up my sleeve
Like i said using only my hands
Jinkies
Velma lend me a hand
no way
These are mine
there is a new face in magic mine
Impostor
Scooby Shaggy now
Magnetic polarity
Like the ghost is grounded
Thanks to magnets in its shoes
the same magnets it used to levitate
Let me out
Like where'd he go
it is time to bring the curtain down on Mr Wacky Pants' career
Phylidia Flanders
Rufus' assistant
so that is how the ghost knew all of Rufus' tricks
Mr Wacky Pants seemed like an obvious suspect but he could not even do the simplest magic tricks
the biggest clue though was Rufus' cat
it was not afraid of the ghost
Thus the ghost had to have been someone close to Rufus
Hence Phylidia
but why Phylidia
because after you disappeared i was supposed to step into the spotlight
i knew all your tricks
i would've made millions but Del Stone would not hear it
so you wanted to ruin Del Stone
that is right
and i would have succeeded if not for you meddling kids
you will have plenty of time to develop your own act where you are going
yeah like as long as you do not try any escape tricks
i want to thank you kids for solving the mystery and for luring Rufus out of retirement
he agreed to play the Spackle Dome a few times a year
on my terms
Hey Scoob i think we finally found the mother lode of backstage grub
Like those are the biggest fruit salads i have ever seen
Hey look at Shaggy and Scooby
Scooby Dooby Doo
yeah
Subtitles by SDI Media Group Napisy pobrane z http napisy org nowa wizja napiswso i am going to play a note
Repeat after me okay
i will play the bass you play the chords
a child prodigy is a child whose parents have a wild imagination
THE CHlLD PRODlGY
Andre we can not
we can not end up on the street
Mom will worry
she will understand
you and your crazy ideas
Your stupid ideas get me in trouble
yes
got a piano
you are the Mathieu boy from next door
yeah
Give me 5 cents i will play something for you
he doesn't wanna starve
Mimi
what is this about a recital
the recital
you told Andre we'd organize a recital
playing for an audience is part of learning Rodolphe
as you well know
will i play
there
See
how can i refuse him now
Just say no and leave it at that
i am working with a young composer learning his craft
he is not a circus animal
he practices 3 hours a day studies music theory and dictation works on his compositions
Public recognition might do him good
do you good
if you object just say no
See that
when you do that
what
that
Create drama then wash your hands of it
the prodigy we have heard so much about
Prodigy may sound overblown
Beyond his pianistic talents the originality of his works is staggering
his power to express what he sees and feels
Excuse me
Meet Mr Wilfrid Pelietier
my former student and now a great conductor with the New York Metropolitan Opera
Good evening Andre
my love tonight is crucial for ourfuture
Understand
of course
she seems nervous
Indeed
after his Concertino no
2 young Mr Mathieu ended his recital with 3 piano studies
to what extent should the young prodigy's works be attributed to him
in short his composing is all too akin to his father's
the modern tones suggest as much
what absolute rubbish
Enough Rodolphe
no one cares what Leduc says
they say they are not my works
they mean your style resembles yourfather's
no
they mean i am the composer
they will persecute him because they despise what i stand for
Rodolphe calm down
my modern music galls them
they like their square dancing music harmonica reels
they want hymns celebrating the Mass of Monsignor so and so singing the praises of St Whoever patron saint of lost causes
Genius or not the boy has genius
he consistently amazes me
he must not languish here
i know people in New York who'd love to help
Leduc's a real halfwit
he can not read a musical score
he is tone deaf
there is plenty to do here
Mr Hutcheson wants you to audition for Jullilard one of the world's best music schools
you are the best music school
that is sweet
it is true
do not act like a spolled child
we are in New York to stay
he wants to know what you will be playing
the cadenza of his 2nd Concertino
not while my son's playing
Shows how he is thinking big
we are talking a committee of professional mentoring musicians
One's even offered to house him
and his family
Andre is a rare virtuoso very rare for a child his age
Just a moment
we are not talking about training a virtuoso but a composer
you can not ask Julillard to support the whole family
it is not possible
you are right angel
we will be much better off in French speaking Paris
can we visit the Eiffel Tower
we will see it every day
Paris
who said anything about Paris
Costs a fortune
Let's cross
the smell
the cellings walls
i lived right there
Downstairs was Madame de Vinet
Upstairs was the English violinist
and Fernandel across the way
i must call my manager
Did i ever mention Marcel de Valmalete
that is making that sound
and the music
you punch the holes
no
i buy them
Composition Class
how do you compose
Close your eyes
Excuse me
to understand
i have to explain
Close your eyes
Picture yourself behind a big boat
Think of seaguils
here is an easier one

Stinging bees
Indians

all of Paris will be there
Members of the Mozart Society too
most great critics as well
Vuillermoz Rebatet

Rachmaninov could come
Pipo
Wait

Rachmaninov will be there
i only play my compositions
Please come tell me if you liked it
Sorry i have to practice
Sergei
my respects sir madam
Thank you for coming
i think that is Rachmaninov
of course
he has big hands
Dear Rodolphe how are you
Quite well thank you
Delighted you came
would not miss it
Good evening
Same to you
Come
Mom and Dad will be looking for us
Sergei
how are you son
you are a journalist
yes sir
who is the man with Rachmaninov
the pianist Charles Bojarzin
a disciple of Rachmaninov's
he quit at the height of his fame
i remember
Good evening
you too
you may not understand the importance of tonight's concert
Ourfuture depends on it
Understand
Whatever happens i will always be proud of you
i am proud of you too
Mr Mathieu how do you feel after such a triumph
Excuse me
Magnificent son
Look
he reminds me of you
he reminds me of you
Congratulations my friend
there is
how do you say
Depth and power in your compositions
Simple yet so complex
Andre Mathieu has quickly become an extraordinary pianist composer
as we heard the other night at the Salle Chopin
i believe this new Mozart has a very bright future
Brete Les Artistes d'Aujourd'hui
his works manifest an authority
an independence and dynamism that denote a disposition with which we will have to reckon
Carol Berard I'Echo de Paris
Young Andre Mathieu is a child overwhose crib
all good music fairies leaned
if the word'genius' has meaning it may be found here
i do not yet know if young Andre Mathieu will surpass Mozart but i maintain that at his age
Mozart had created nothing equal to what was performed
with stunning panache by this miraculous boy
Emile Vuillermoz
do you still compose
i left the urge to compose behind in Russia
Just the opposite for me
i have been composing 100 times more since i arrived here
you are very fortunate
my music no longer seems to interest anyone
if so how will mine
Your music speaks to the heart not to the head
Today composers are more interested in a riot of noise and dissonance
they call it modernism
i need a melody
otherwise i can not manage
Keep listening to your heart
Remain true to yourself
Only you can lay claim to my succession
you have what it takes to become a great composer
Paris welcomes Andre Mathieu

little Mozart the film
for this war is not a Franco German war that can be decided by a battle
this a world war
None can foresee if neutral countries
will remain so
will Germany's allies remain so
we have been advised to leave Paris
if the Germans come it may be too late
i brought you my record
Thank you
Take care of yourself son
we are leaving
Good luck
Take care
Perhaps we will meet again
Good luck
i need help Wilfrid
do it forAndre
the horn is magnificent
the beauty of the strings
i still think the same of him
i still have my friends
i am glad i am still among them
Smells dusty like cat pee
a good cleaning will put it back in order
not a cleaning a miracle
okay children we can either complain and feel sorry for ourselves or settle in and show the Americans what the French discovered
i know we just arrived but this competition is open to everyone
no one can do better
you have discussed this with Rodolphe
I'd rather keep him out of it
Rodolphe has his pride
i am not sure he'd agree
it is my score
Just a minute Andre
he wants to know what
not half notes
what is he saying
that you do not understand
no he doesn't
not eighth notes triplets to break the rhythm
that he understands
he is making a suggestion use eighth notes instead of triplets
i used a triplet because i wanted a triplet
what is the problem
Change your attitude or there will be a big one
what attitude
i do not understand a thing
you answerfor me
what am i supposed to do
i am here to help you
and it is very hard to sit here at the second piano having no input in your lessons
i trust you understand that
Wipe that smirk off
Enough with the prima donna attitude
what are you doing
Your turn
you can only move one square at a time
but you moved 2 squares
that is different
i have a king
of course it is always different for you
you are special
that is the thanks i get for playing with you
you are playing with me because you can not play alone
there
i do not wanna play anymore
Congratulations
you won
i won
the New York Philharmonic's composition competition
i was not even there
it is a composition competition
they do not want to see the composer but the score
what did i win
the New York Philharmonic Orchestra
i won an orchestra
you will play with the orchestra
here
what about me
you are too llttle
what he is bigger than me
Always the same old story
do we have anything for her
i will see
Easy easy
Young Andre Mathieu's sensational N Y debut
more than 2 000 fans applaud Andre Mathieu
Mathieu acclaimed in U S
Prodigy of yesterday young master of today
Mathieu already an accompilshed musician
New works at world premiere
Modernity is not for me
it is too fast paced
i am totally old fashioned
Modernity is crap
it allows morons to justify their mediocrity
Mediocre or not it can not be the solution
Wait
Concerto for Percussion and Stairs
that is nothing new
it is been done
See
i am really old fashioned
Arthur Honegger's Class
Arthur Honegger's Class
so
so what
what do you have for me
Avague idea
Mr Mathieu henceforth
i want you sober in class
Understand
but i am sober
that is the problem
I'd start with something a llttle modern like
Mr Mathieu i am talking to you
me too
Detach
Detach more
Articulate
Mr Mathieu you are the greatest pianist i have ever heard
Believe me i have heard them all
what about my concerto
Your virtuosity is extraordinary
Unique
you could become the greatest pianist of your time
my only interest is my compositions
anyone can play the piano
what about the European tour
Touring
i am a composer not a pianist Camillette
you are lovelier than ever
it is true
you are a woman now
you will have to hold your own
how
you have always come first
when you are around it is all about you
when you are not even more so
you take up so much space everyone else is left out
Camillette
that is just how it is
you should've seen Mom
Sitting by her bags convinced we'd join you someday
Atotal nutcase
you are not nine anymore
Mathieu of Paris and New York
those days are gone
you should not have come back
for your own sake
you still had a chance there
it is a wasteland here
God knows what went wrong
Broke
Uninspired
Above all gutless
i am washed up
Meet Serge Lebrun a fellow actor
Andre Mathieu
Delighted
i am a big fan Andre
if you need anything Benzedrine amphetamines
i have got it all
i am good thanks
this is different
i have got this
Intense
Intense
Glorious
Divine
you think no more of your good friend cruel woman
do not you know that without you without your heart your love
there is no happiness no life for your husband
Pathetic
what
Napoleon
it is a letter to Josephine
Maybe their relationship lacked magic
so he made her disappear
Colette Ostiguy
Yourfather taught my sister Marianne
you are the actress
my father always said he had two daughters one beautiful the other smart
you are not so bad
Charmer
Aman has no friends his happiness has plenty
have you known these two long
Long enough to be ashamed when they speak
Small wonder she is still single
Marriage creates problems you would not have if you were single
Look a piano play something before things get worse
you are an actor Serge
I'd never dream of asking you to perform Mollere in a restaurant
you want me to play piano in a restaurant
Leave him alone
you are being ridiculous
have you known Robert Gouin long
i met him one night at the theatre then we went for a drink
now we are inseparable
Robert Gouin's a great actor
you never know when he is being honest
he is always been honest with me
i do not have many friends
Yet you are famous
Famous in name only
Your name must be of some use
in reminding me of who i was
you have regrets
Quite the opposite
when we got back from New York we had nothing left
Penniless too
and i was a bit too old to play to the gallery
Being the family breadwinner at 11 is a heavy burden
and you
it is compilcated
it is never enough
my mother says you are the most moving actress she is ever seen
Your mother
you are talking about your mother
what are you doing
Watching you sleep
Like when you were little
i think i am in love
in love
what do you know about love
nothing
i write hours of emotion filled music yet know nothing about love
Love is compilcated
Compilcated
it is not compilcated it is beautiful
it can be painful too
who is she
does it matter
i have a right to know
i have always said trust Mimi Mathieu to go to war over a flirt
as you say we will have to cut the cord someday
Andre who is she
Colette
Ostiguy
the actress
if anyone can understand me it is her
Andre has a busy career
i have my career too
do not you think he is a little young for you
it was not clear
when it starts off badly
we were looking for you
can we talk
Sure
Well we
we will go see
we will be outside
you okay
i love you
i really like you
i think you are charming
Above all intelligent
you have experienced so much but
of course
there is always a but
i really like you Andre
but it won't work
Damn damn damn
this is your doing huh
i know it is you
you went to see her
what is he talking about
you robbed me of everything
my youth
my money
my name
you sold me a dream only to take it away
what more do you want
to rip my heart out
my guts
you want my soul too
it is all your fault Mimi Mathieu
i will never forgive you
never
What'd i miss
Mind your own business
what happened
what is happening to him
nothing
Let's go
if something bad happened you'd tell me
no need to talk i understand
it is heartbreaking
the bad news is you neverforget the first time
but you see artists the great ones feed on such moments
and you have the ability to express yourfeelings through your music
you are becoming a man son
i want to go back to Paris
Running away won't help
you can not escape a broken heart
Composer Andre Mathieu is staging a comeback attempting to beat the world record for endurance held by American Carl Fletcher
Tickets are 1 which include a free drink
a poker tournament will also be held
Bring family and friends have your picture taken with our national virtuoso
a piano derby
Andre Mathieu is taking part in a piano derby
Unbelievable
Know what
i can not help thinking of poor Rodolphe
he must be mortified
you are a composer Andre
you are going to humiliate yourself for a lousy contest
i have been starving all my life
i drank to dull the hunger
so excuse me if dignity is foreign to me
do not you have a shred of integrity left
all these years spent believing he is a serious musician to end up a piano playing puppet
so he is a clown
Andre Mathieu has become nothing but a circus act
Maybe i miss it
Maybe i need to see people
Sorry but i won't end up like you
i won't crawl to the CBC begging them to play my works
Go ahead boy
Make a fool of yourself
have it your way go ahead
Go on
do as you please
Andre Mathieu making his entrance
i shall greet him personally
Welcome Andre
Andre Mathieu whom i saw perform at the University of Ottawa where he played one of his own works
Very impressive
Andre Mathieu sits at the piano
the room goes quiet
i was asked if i would execute my works
i said i am against the death penalty
the first piece i composed was in the Night
i was therefore bom in the dead of night
my first recital was at age 5 here in Montreal
1 30 a m
there is still a big crowd
hello
Good evening
what is your name
Vivianne
Let's not be formal
Vivianne
as in vivifying
20 hours 59 minutes
Almost there
one of our hometown greats about to achieve a remarkable feat
21 consecutive hours of his works
less than a minute to go
you are humiliating yourself for a lousy contest
the circus animal's too old
it is okay
it is me
it is Camillette
it is okay
Get help would you
Calm down Andre
Calm down
if it was not for me you'd be a ballerina
Clear off
Paris
Honneger forget your concerto
Detox Centre
Once Groleau pays me i am going back to Paris
400
he said what with the hall advertising expenses free drinks
he promised 10 000
Andre listen
you have to stop drinking
you can not go on this way
Your father he just wants me at the piano
you have no right
Your father has always put you first
i never want to hear you speak ill of your father because you do not know
Get better Andre
then go away
Leave home
Your problem is not booze it is her
if she could she'd have you stuffed
play Canadian Spring for me
i can not it is summer
oh
my Beautiful Love
be serious
it is my favourite
the teacher usually gives the orders
is this not a piano lesson
Go fool around somewhere else
Understand Miss Lecompte
we should take a walk
Let's go to my place
you want to what
Get married
to whom
Gustav Mahler
Say something
what can i say
he wants to marry
at his age
who put such ideas in your head
you can not even cook an egg
we are not cooking we are getting married
Weddings are expensive
Money is not a problem
we will manage
Listen carefully
as long as i live there will never be another Mrs Mathieu
we should write you a requiem
i know i have disappointed you
it is your life
do as you please
one marries for love
not to escape one's parents
a mother knows
we have sacrificed our llves for you
we have never asked for anything
and we will keep doing so son
we will always be there
i am tired
i feel old
i just feel like closing my eyes never waking up
i want a baby
Why
as fodder for the devil
you want to sell dishes
when you get gas they give you plates glasses
Bowls too
Takes a while to get a full set
i will sell them what they need
how
Door to door
Tell you what i will call them
they will pick this up and we will forget the dishes okay
Seemed like a good idea
you are a pianist Andre
Pianists play the piano they do not sell dishes
i am a composer not a pianist
do not touch that it is contagious
i have lost interest
i think i have lost my passion
you never lose that
when i think of all you have sacrificed
it was no hardship
when you came along
i was not going anywhere
i never told you but you have always been my best friend
that is a great compilment Andre
if i only had half your talent
i would've accomplished great things
you just wanted to please everyone
it is no sin
you wanted to please everyone at once
Mr Mathieu
Cecile Lebel
Afriend of the Mayor's
you do not know me but i know you
i attended your first recital
that was a lifetime ago madam
as a child i was somebody else
you could even say i was somebody
the Mayorwould love you to play your Romantic Rhapsody for the 325th anniversary celebration of the City of Montreal
the Mayor's never heard it
Neither have i
Indeed we want to hear it
Romantic Rhapsody accompanied by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra
it could lead to a big tour
Andre Mathieu's comeback
Keeping Andre busy keeps him sober
you did not mention me
Absolutely not
i hope he understands
the Mayor can use his influence but only Andre can help himself
i really appreciate this
i am doing it for Andre
Out of the question
Mr Pelletier the Mayor of Montreal has insisted Andre
we have never seen the score of the Rhapsody
here you are
we have never heard it
Please Mr Pelletier
if you have any respect for Andre give him a chance
it is your orchestra
Achance
he is had countless chances
Andre Mathieu has become nothing but a circus act
Allttle exhibitionist tinkler
who is responsible for his own misfortunes
Andre Mathieu is dead
he died the night of his piano derby
Sorry Mimi but it is true
i found something for Rhapsody's ending
Sixteenth notes scales
Sextuplet
Cecile called
the concert's been cancelled
Pelletier claims that since it is never been played the orchestra would need 20 hours' rehearsal
they can not afford it
there is still the tour
Cecile's working hard setting up dates
i imagine
it sounds flat
Your instruments are out of tune
Take five
they are nice but i can not work with students
it is almost a quarter tone off
Bad news
the concert tour
i had to cancel it
Only 9 tickets were sold
they have forgotten me
i have been forgotten
Andre Mathieu died in 1968 at age 39
his repertoire includes more than 100 works

Only this is your last chance to be involved in my life
i swear
KNOCKlNG ON DOOR
Ben someone's at the door
no
do not answer it
Why not
hi Mr Boykewich
hi there
Good morning
Good morning come on in
Morning Ben
i was wondering if i may speak with you
could i get you a cup of coffee or something
no thank you Adrian
do you mind if i talk to Ben alone
no i do not mind
i should have called you
yeah you should have
i did not drink
i swear i did not
she is an alcoholic Ben
She'd been sober for almost two years and she fell off the wagon when she was with you
what happened
Well
i am not quite sure
she was lecturing me on the dangers of alcohol and then her old girlfriend showed up with Ruben
they were at the bar and then she came over to talk to Nora and then
i do not know
a waiter got an order mixed up and brought over a bottle of wine to the table and the next thing i know she is drunk
and pretty belligerent
Why did not you take her to her house
because she lives with Ricky's mother
Ricky's other mother
i forget which one is the other mother and which one's the mother
anyway she refused to give me the address and i did not want to call Ricky so i just dumped her off where i thought she'd be safe
i had to let her go from the office
had to
Too much information in that office about me and my business and you even
i can not have someone getting drunk and going around talking to people and saying something stupid
i told her she could go back to the butcher shop
is she going to be back at the butcher shop today when i am at the butcher shop and Ricky's at the butcher shop
Maybe you should reconsider
i mean she is in AA
i am sure she will just quit drinking again
we talked about this
it is not that easy to just quit drinking
some people can not just quit drinking
and i am afraid that if you start drinking you could be one of those people
i am not but you could be
Dad i am probably going to have a drink once in a while
i will be responsible when i drink and not drink too much and i won't drive when i have had a drink
but i am probably going to drink
i told you i do not think you should
oh geez
i wish you'd just do what i tell you to do you know that
if you'd just do what i tell you
i would not have to do this
i do not want to do this
you do not want to do what
Ruin your memories
Change the image that you have always had of your mother
what
Your mother was a lovely lovely woman
she was sweet she was funny
she was a good wife and a good mother
and she was an alcoholic
and so was her mother and her father
they died in a car accident before you were born caused by her father
they were coming home from a party drunk
i know you knew about the car accident but i never told you the other stuff because i did not want you to think of them ke that
anyway your mom quit drinking after the accident but she always struggled with it Ben she always did
so i do not want you to have a drink
at all
and i am sorry to have to tell you why
me too

Why is he coming over to meet us
because he wants to
i have met him he is really nice
do not lie to them
he is not always nice and you probably won't like him until you get to know him
Tom do not make them hate the guy before he even gets here
it is really no big deal
i met Milton and i thought you might like him
he is a little gruff
like the Grinch who stole Christmas before he got his heart
but he has a heart he has a very big heart and he is funny
KNOCKlNG ON DOOR
i got it
here he is
Good morning

CHUCKLES

i do not think so
i mean we could but it is just so expensive
i mean I'd have to buy a dress
Ricky would have to buy a suit and
what is the point
we live together
we can dance in our living room
what is the point
the point is it is a rite of passage
it is the senior dance
it is the kick off to all the senior activities that are coming up
yeah but i do not think Ricky's all that hooked into all that senior stuff
i mean he is really focused on college so i do not think he is making any of it too important
he is so cute
i can not wait till Ben and i have a baby
Someday

hi Daniel
hi
Good morning
yeah i guess 11 30 is still morning
i was wondering if we could ask you something
CELL PHONE RlNGS
oh
it is Amy
i better take this it might be important
are you sure she is mature enough for you to go out with
you seem slightly more mature than Grace
which is why i like you and trust you
can she sleep over at my place tonight
i would rather she did not
but that is up to the two of you
Thank you
and just because she is sleeping over doesn't mean you have to do anything
okay
okay what
okay i heard you and i do not know that we won't be doing anything to be honest
Think about it
i will
AMY
Grace you have to talk to her
i saw this look in her eye when she was holding John and i am telling you she is actually thinking about it
i know it sounds crazy but
it does it sounds crazy
SCOFFS
Why do you sound funny
i sound funny'cause i have a frog in my throat but why do you sound funny
what do you know
i know nothing i told you i know nothing
yes you do
you do not think she is actually trying to trick Ben into getting her pregnant or something crazy like that do you
something like that
but you have to promise not t t to say anything
Grace
she told you she is trying to get pregnant again
yeah
no
no she is not thinking straight
Talk to her
she is still depressed or something and thinks this is the way out
she can not do this to herself or to Ben or their families
and everyone's still recovering
i know that
but you can not tell her tha and i can not tell her that she won't hear any of it
the only person we can talk to is Ben
one of us should tell Ben
Well that can not be me
i tried and Adrian caught me and made me swear i would not so it can not be me either
Maybe Ricky would do it
you should get Ricky to do it
oh and by the way Jack is looking for someone to go to the senior dance with so if you or Ricky know anyone
what does that have to do with anything
i do not know
it is just something else for you to talk to Ricky about
do you have any makeup remover
Milton
you are not what i pictured
it was not my idea
i am sorry
it is not your fault
but you could not have grabbed the bottle or the glass or something
i did not know what to do
we are never having dinner again
all right
could i speak to you
not today okay
another day
now
you are not in charge here
Drop it for right now Ricky all right
not right now
if you two want to take a break
i just got here but
Just talk to her
i can not help her
i really can not help her
no probably not but maybe she will realize that and go to a meeting
could save her life
Hey
i am going to talk to him at some point you know
yeah i know
Look the boss called
and he wants you to fire her from here too
i mean she probably should not be around sharp objects
or cash
he wanted me to know that Ben was having a bad day
he talked to him about going out with your mom and to kind of emphasize his concern about drinking
not just her drinking but Ben's recent exploits
he told Ben something he never knew before
is it something that i would give a crap about
his mother was an alcoholic
so maybe you two have more in common than anyone thought
a little help please
here
i got it
hi John
Good job on the laundry
yeah yeah help the lady upstairs
Come on
Did you pass by Ben and my mother Nora on your way in
yeah i saw Ben
but i did not stop to talk to him
he did not look like he wanted to talk
he turned his back to me as soon as he saw us coming up and
so she was not out there huh
she probably took off
Took off where
Whwould she take off
she fell off the wagon
she is D R U N K
not now she got D R U
Why are we spelling
he doesn't know what drunk is
i do not want him to know
what happened
she went out with Ben to give him a lecture on not drinking and somehow it turned around on her and she slipped
Poor Nora
she was doing so well
Longest she is done that well
i guess i should have been paying more attention
what am i saying
it was not my fault
she is responsible for her own problems
Wait
Did Ben get drunk too
oh geez i really hope he is not drinking and getting drunk every night otherwise he really is going to get Adrian pregnant again
huh
you have to talk to him Ricky you have to tell him
Tell him what
i think Adrian is trying to get pregnant again
what would make you think that
not that it is any of our business
she stopped over at my dad's house and then she was holding John and then just this look in her eyes
Amy please tell me you are not jumping to some crazy conclusion based on a look in Adrian's eyes
no but that look did make me want to talk to Grace so i called Grace
what is it with you girls
we are girls
Anyways Grace said that Adrian told her
she told her that she is trying to get pregnant again
oh
and she wanted to know if you know anyone that would go to the senior dance with Jack
no
i do not
and Adrian actually said this
Mmm hmm
yeah
and we doubt that Ben knows and someone has to tell him
no
what if she traps him a seco
he was not trapped
he had choices
and he chose to get married
if he is stupid enough to get her pregnant again then that is his problem
yeah and the baby's problem
Babies can not help who their parents are
Parents can not help who their kids are either
they can only do so much you know
we can only do our best to raise John to be a good man and that is all we can do and that may not be enough
but he will have a much better chance if we do the best we can together
do not make me take you to that dance

now Aces can be high or low
so it goes Ace King Queen Jack 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and Ace
the suits are spades hearts clubs and diamonds
no one suit is higher than another
the best five card poker hand wins
Questions
how much is the ante
he said two pennies
i will ask them
who wants chocolate chip cookies
we do
we do
Let's go
do not look at my cards
who me
of course not
Run along kid
Well i think i turned that around do not you think
i think so
but if i were you I'd let them win at cards
oh absolutely
and the pot is going to be big
i mean big 10
Maybe more
two bucks will be plenty
two each
i do not want you to bribe them
but that is one of the things i do best bribes
you better knock that stuff off if you ever want a chance with me
i would like a chance with you
Hmm
would you maybe like to go out of the house without the kids next Saturday night
Maybe take in a movie have some dinner
or we could take them if you want
Maybe Grandma Kathleen will look after them
I'd hate to ask Tom again
you are calling that broad in there Grandma
Sorry
that is no broad that is Tom's mother
i am going to have to work on you
but not too much
i can cook i just do not have any pots and pans
i haven't had time to get all that stuff
oh yeah what can you cook
the basics
Scrambled eggs hamburgers and macaroni and cheese from a package
i can only bake
i bake cookies
Cooking's basically chemistry right
we are both good in chemistry we should be able to learn to cook
Maybe we should take cooking lessons together
oh no do not get that i want to marry you look in your eye again
Why do you keep accusing me of wanting to marry you
because i want you to want to marry me because i want to want to marry you
but you do not
but i do not know if i do
and you do not know if you want to marry me either
we do not have to do anything that you do not want to do or you are not ready to do
we can just hang out talk
Did my mother talk to you
she is like a hypnotist
she did hint around that we could wait
can we leave my mother out of this relationship
i doubt it
she can not keep us from having sex
but she can try
she and Jack
Jack
Jack said something to you
he wants you to go to the senior dance with him just as a friend
would you Jack take me to the senior dance just as a friend
what do you think
Again
i am not drunk
i just have a headache from motion sickness
i was riding around on the bus all afternoon
Why did not you just go home
oh because Ricky's mother would kill me if
if she knew i had a beer
i only had one beer
the bus stop was in front of a liquor store
okay i am lying i had more than one beer
i had several beers
Your dad sent a big guy with white hair out to look for me
he found me
hi
my name is Ben
and i do not want to be an alcoholic
Neither do i but
but
i guess i am just a big fat failure at everything huh
not at everything
Your son's a pretty nice guy
my son Ricky
oh he is not my son he is Margaret's son
i am just his birth mother
oh come on she did not do everything
she did not inspire him not to drink
i do not know about that
you certainly inspired me not to drink
which is important because
i am sure as your friend Bill probably knew it is really important to stay away from alcohol
Especially if you had a parent or parents who have or had issues with alcohol
Leo
no
my mom
and her mom
and her dad
Apparently i come from a long line of alcoholics
i am sorry i did not know
i did not either
Well i do not recommend it for anyone
Even if you do not come from a long line you could be first in line
i think that is a good idea for Ben to talk to her
Good for Ben and good for her
sometimes people can hear things better when it do not come from family you know
yeah i guess that is true
i can not put her back in the office you know
i really enjoyed having her there but
i think she needs to get
Sober
and stay sober
yeah i think so
it is nice that you are even letting her work at the butcher shop
oh
okay
Well
that is understandable too
i just told her yesterday if you continue to go to meetings
and stay sober
you could work at the butcher shop
Unfortunately i found her walking around today not sober
all right she will have to find another job then
you know i have a soft spot for people in trouble
for women who have a lot of challenges
i kind of heard about Ben's mother
i did not want to tell him but i felt i had to
it is a lot to deal with with everything he is been going through but he is going to have to deal with it
he is going to have to grow up and deal with life
and he is going to have to do that sober
i have a drink once in a while but i do not get drunk
i do not drink i can not stand the smell of it
it brings back too many bad memories and i just do not get it
that is good
Maybe you could stay close to Ben be a friend to him
i wish i were a better friend to him
i need to tell him something but just do not think i am the person to talk to him about this
sometimes women make you do stupid things you know
Like what
Like Amy is making me tell you this
Adrian is hoping to get Ben to get her pregnant again
you do not mean now you mean sometime in the distant future
now
and how would i have heard that
how can i tell him i heard that without telling him who i heard it from
Please do not
Adrian
what is she thinking
Just wanted to let you know i am leaving the house
Habit
Just checking to see what time it is
what time is it
Almost 11 00
what is there to do at 11 00 on a Saturday night
that is what time the parties usually start around 11 00
Really
yeah
all right well drive safely
i will
i do not really want to go out but i have to find a date to the dance
i have to go to that dance
i do not if you
oh no Jack i am sorry
but i am very flattered you asked but no
and i am sure you can find a date
no i really can not
Maybe there are some other guys who are going that do not have dates and you can all go together
no
i do not think so
Just wanted to say goodnight
Good night Kathleen
Jack
Goodnight
Goodnight
i had a really nice time
Thank you for dinner and everything
i will talk to you tomorrow
Mmm hmm
i thought you were staying over
no i decided not to stay over
okay
and we did not do anything either
i decided i think i am just gonna be a little smarter this time
would not that have to be next time
and what i am saying is
i think i like a guy that can make me wait
Goodnight
Goodnight
EXHALES
oh hi
i was just about to go to bed
how are you
i am okay
i am surprisingly okay
how are you
i am fine
Excited about the dance next week
yeah should be fun
i guess i should go pick up some condoms
Hmm
little joke
Senior dance joke
sometimes seniors get carried away at those dances and go out and do things they should not
Well we are married
so we can have sex if we want to
Even if we are just friends pretending to be married
yeah
of course we can
if we want
Goodnight Adrian
Goodnight Ben
SlGHS
oh
hi
you fell asleep before i got out of the shower and into bed
you smell really nice
Thank you
Goodnight
oh come on
we still haven't done anything on our new sofa bed
oh
all right
oh all right
i will do it if i do not have to take you to that dance
you have to take me to that dance
you know what the theme is
no i do not know what is it
Teens are the Parents of Tomorrow
what
who came up with that theme
someone who doesn't want us there probably
Still want to go
who doesn't want us there
me
Wait
so that is not the theme
no
but i do not want us there and we do not have a babysitter
we will get one
Come on
if you love me you won't make me do this

LAUGHS
i do not care
you are a wonderful man
you promised we'd just stay an hour
uh huh
Unless you are having a really good time
it is the best time i have ever had except for maybe every single night we have been in bed together
LAUGHS
i do not think I'd count band camp
i would
you enjoyed that
i was too scared to enjoy it
you were scared
yeah Amy i was
i actually thought i might have feelings for someone and it scared me
by someone you do mean me do not you
what do you think
i think i should call Lauren to make sure John's all right
John
you better see if Lauren's all right
i will be right back
this was really nice of Daniel to do this
He'd do anything for me
Sure he is not having sex with you
we will see
two can play this game
what game
the waiting game
i am surprised you play it so well what with no experience waiting and l
i really like you
i really like you
i did not get to go to my senior dance
it is kind of nice being back in high school
any chance we could
Nope
People are talking
i do not care
what are they saying now
how beautiful you are
Really
Really
Beautiful enough that you would sleep with me tonight
Just for old time's sake
i can not
CHUCKLES i have heard that before

but before we weren't friends
now we are friends and as your friend and your legal husband
i would never do anything to hurt you again never
LAUREN
OVER PHONE we are fine here
we are having a good time
i do not think i want a baby of my own any time soon but i am good for right now
and i think John's falling asleep
okay well maybe i should just say goodnight to him

Synced by YesCool www addic7ed comi can not
no i can not
i can not
Please
you have 24 hours to live pig
Count them 24
hello
hello
who is this
Hutch
Help
where is the doctor
where is the doctor
hi buddy
there is no effect on your heart yet
we will be sending you upstairs for some more tests
you can sit up and rest for a while now
I'd like to talk to him
in a minute
but first I'd like to ask you a few questions
i understand you and Detective Starsky have been partners for some time now
that is right
yes he said you were his best friend
Doctor what are you trying to tell me
i do not think your friend is going to make it
his relatives other close friends should be notified
what
Well of course he is gonna make it
you got him in a hospital
you are running tests on him
does he know
he asked me to tell you
Said he hates soapy scenes
yeah
hi buddy
how are you feeling huh
okay
could even think i dreamed it all
the guy who did it Starsk was there anything about him
nothing
but i was not exactly rowing with both oars at the time
the doc says i was drugged first
something to make me fuzzy enough so i could not object
but you were clear enough to know what was going on
Whoever it was he wanted to enjoy himself
what about his voice
Did you did you
Did you fix a pattern
Well it was about as dirty a laugh as i have ever heard
i got a feeling it is somebody i know
Dr Franklin
what about the 24 hours
does it hold
if it is a progressive type poison yes its term could be predictable
the blood sample taken at the puncture indicates a poisonous compound probably of the organic chloride grouping
Unfortunately it could be any one of 50 varieties and we can not prescribe the antidote with any certainty until we know the exact composition
that plain enough
the part about the poisonous compound was thank you
you know it is amazing
you are well you think they can cure everything
you get sick they can not cure the cold
my best medical advice at the moment indicates a series of tests
we will be able to deduce certain things from changes in your body chemistry
Doc pursuing our own as they say line of expertise my partner feels he can deduce certain things faster than you can
that is part of his job
but you are not going
Look you are thinking the same thing i am
we are looking for some flake who knows what was in that shot right
Right
Well while i am still feeling okay
we find him and ask him
okay where are my pants
i can not forbid this but i think it is unwise
i appreciate what you are saying but it comes down to one question
can you guarantee if i stay you are gonna come up with the answer in time
okay then I'd like to take a shot at it
now if we do not score by 10 00 tonight i will come back and give you another crack at it okay
Find my pants
i got your watch
you forgot my pants
you mean you want me to hit the streets with no pants no badge no gun no dignity
what is the matter with you
do you believe him
you are right i should've left you lying on the floor while i decided which pair of your crummy jeans i should pack
they are all looking at you
this is Zebra Three
Patch me through to R i
R i Collins
Go ahead Zebra Three
Charlie this is Hutch
Pull every case we worked on in the past five years and have them on our desks
no chance Hutch
Everybody wants it yesterday
have you any idea of our workload
Collins we will be there in 20 minutes
that is how long you got
Hey take it easy
he is got no way of knowing what is going down
do it will you Charlie
it is that important
Captain Dobey will confirm
have him call Receiving Hospital and check on Starsk
got any second thoughts about leaving the hospital
do you
i could be wrong but then i will be walking around tomorrow
the doctor was pretty straight about our chances
yeah
as i see it it is who do we trust time
is that Huggy
Hey what it is
got a job for you
Hey i am gainfully employed
Honest
i got a job as a travel agent
it is a hard buck but an honest one
Need any airplane tickets
what have you heard about a hit going down
on who
me
Sparing the grim details some guy got into my house and gave me a shot
oh you gotta be putting me on
i do not think he was putting me on either
Need your help Hug
you gotta ask
i will do everything i can
Something'll turn
Thanks Hug
Starsk
Take a look at this one
Sorry about the static
okay
it is 11 36
i always did think you were a clock watcher
Dave there must be something you remember about this guy
Eyes hair build
Did you hear that
he called me Dave
Things some people do to get on a first name basis
Really
all right let's see
Vaguely
White male 35 to 50 medium build
any or all possibly inaccurate
Pull the cards and run them against that make
this way we will eliminate the short fat black and female
then we will run them against the in prisons hospitals out of towns
Hutch
do not go away
Get you some coffee
Great
what you got Cheryl
the hospital analysis of the chemical traces at the puncture
Black
Fine
Chlorohydrin and what might be bromoacetone
they could not get a fix on the rest
Level with me
Normal body functioning depends on the central nervous system transmitting automatic impulses
to see to breathe to sweat to swallow cough
over simplified certain progressive poisons attack the central system and block the impulses
what happens
Uncontrolled perspiration distorted vision loss of coordination difficult breathing coma
when it gets bad i can help the pain some but
Cheryl he is gonna need the best the chemistry field can offer right
how is it with your father
he doesn't seem to wanna see me or anybody
can you ask him to help
i have already tried
he hasn't returned my call
Look i will go out to the house if i have to
Thank you

Well then you would not mind telling us where he is
Knowing he would not find out it was me that told you
Nope

Somewhere on Channing Avenue i think

we can not go on in there without probable cause
Like stupid here taking a swing at us
Wait a second

Ask the crew
Come on Janos

Tell him a funny story

oh it hurts Hutch
oh God it hurts
i know
i know
Buddy i am here
i am here
how are you doing huh
i am scared
Well i do not know what there is to be scared about
we have still got seven hours
oh that is right
Just enough time to catch the double bill at the Rivoli and finish that book i was reading
Well we know it is not Bellamy and we know it is not Janos
all we have gotta do is to find Wedell
Only he ain't turning up
we got a whole police force looking in this city and he ain't showing
that is because you and me are not on the streets
as soon as we get back on the streets we will turn that turkey
Probably find him in a trash can
Sure
Hit the streets run down a few alleys
Bust down a few doors
Get a few snitches working
the guy won't have a chance
Cheryl will you hurry up with that stuff
here this will help
Boy that arm's been really getting it
you okay
oh yeah
i am fine
the room's in pretty bad shape but i am doing just fine
i can not give you anything stronger without knocking you out
Please that is all i need
what is the good of all your books and your junk your toys your stuff if it doesn't do anything
what is happening here Cheryl
nothing very good
you are doing all you can Cheryl
i did go out to campus
Dad was in a faculty meeting
he could not come out
would not i guess
what is the matter with him
how come you make excuses for him
Softly
do not antagonize the people i need
he is doing all he can
he sent his assistant to the lab to run a spectrograph on the slide from the hospital
he is a new boy
Knows his trade too
Even learning the composition won't help unless they know the proportions

Thank you
Thank you lady very very much

i will take it
i have as they say a vested interest in this case
besides he is our only lead
Listen

Starsky and Hutchinson
they were here a while ago
they just came back
where is he
i did not wanna lie

what is the matter Hutchinson
you lose your piece
Maybe you are afraid to shoot huh
Kill me and you kill your partner
Right

Thanks buddy
What'd you have to do that for
he was the only guy that knew
Seemed to be a good idea at the time
i am sorry
we are gonna have to take him upstairs now
if his timetable is right he is got less than two hours
Hey buddy
i have to go now
okay
Hey
yeah yeah yeah okay okay
Well that is it huh
no that is not it
Look Hutch we only have two hours
i do not care if we got two minutes we do not give up
we have missed something captain
we have been in such a hurry
we have rushed right past something important
Hutch we put 200 names in the computer
we get 20 possibles and three primes
it is not our fault if they all wash out
they did not all wash out
Vic Bellamy did not wash out
he was
Vic Bellamy only had a 10th grade education
how did he get the smarts to pull this off
you think somebody hired him
Absolutely
do not you
Right
Somebody's gotta tell me who
i am sorry
i am sorry
i am so sorry
for Vic and you and me and your partner
Stop being sorry
i am sorry
Honest
Help me
Vic was not smart enough to do this by himself
he had to have help
who helped him
i do not know
who helped him
i do not know
Tell me
i do not know his name
Tell me
he hired Vic
who
he has to do with the university
hello Cheryl
it is 2 30
i am sorry it is late but i have to talk with you
it is been quite a while
Come in
Thank you
Dad why haven't you wanted me to come and see you
are you somehow blaming me for Jerry
Your brother's dead
Let him lie
no
Tell me
it is important to me
you are important to me
i can not help thinking that when you told the police you lit the fuse
Jerry was peddling drugs on campus
i just wanted him to stop
i just wanted to help
Jerry was a good boy
Hutch what are you doing here
Cheryl i may need your help
Bear with me
i wanna talk to your father
Detective Hutchinson you are not welcome in my home
we have gone way past that
what are you talking about
Ask your father
he knows
i just spoke with Vic Bellamy's widow
Vic Bellamy
the man your brother was pushing dope for when he was killed
if you do not leave my house peaceably i am going to have to call the campus police
you will find them busy professor
they and some detectives are opening up your laboratory
but why
they will look for a poisonous compound injected into Starsky
Cheryl your father is the man who wants to kill him
that is insane
yes i guess it is
at least that is what the defence attorneys will plead
but you see Cheryl your father contacted Vic Bellamy a few weeks ago after he got out of prison
the two of them held a grudge against me and Starsky
it was a perfect partnership was not it professor
Dad please tell him it is not so
Tell him
yes professor go on tell me
where did i make my mistake
the compound itself
it was far too sophisticated for anybody as simple as Bellamy
Dad
you will not find anything in the lab
Well then they will come here
they will tear this
it is here is not it
of course it is
there is enough stuff for both Starsky and me
Dad Dad please what is this all
Just shut up
can not you ever keep your mouth shut
you have it all figured out
yes
but why
because they killed my son
they killed Jerry
Professor you do not think
you do not think that we wanted to kill him do you
i read your story in the police report
Dad Hutch tried to protect you in that report
Jerry was an addict stoned out of his mind constantly
that is a lie
Sir his mind had already been taken over
his brain was soup
no
we tried to calm him down
we tried to bring him back to the house
it is in the report
he grabbed my gun
it went off accidentally
it is not his fault
he was spaced out
Stop it
Professor i am asking you
i am begging you
Please stop this before it is too late
my boy is dead
he was a good boy
he is dead
i am asking you to save my partner's life
Professor give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Dad please
Dad it is all right
it is all right
it is over
it is over
two cc's hydrochloride
one cc bromoacetone
Four cc's benzyl cyanide one cc diphenylamine
yes i think your friend is gonna make it
Thank you doctor
Hey hey hey
what are you doing here
Come on
the doctor returned me to work as soon as possible
Well sit over here
Watch yourself
how are you feeling
you look awful
oh i am okay
you do not look okay
i am okay
i am gonna talk to those doctors
Wait a sec wait a sec captain
the doctors say recovery has to start somewhere
it is best to become active as soon as possible
you do not look like you will be active to me
what do you think Hutch
he looks terrible
you ought to go home till you get better
no
how long before you'd be recovered
Couple of weeks
it is not that import
Shut up Starsky
we know more about this than you do
you are gonna take two weeks off
Well if you insist
would you get me a glass of water
yeah sure
Captain Dobey here
Hey captain
yeah tell Starsky i got his reservations
Starsky's confirmed for two weeks in the pleasure capital of the Caribbean
Hutchinson get on that phone
it is important you hear this
would you mind repeating that
Well it is this great little hotel in St Thomas
yeah all the New York secretaries go there
yeah it will be full of all the kinds of girls Starsky says he wants
it is got the other stuff he asked for too
Tennis scuba marlin fishing
it is the greatest
yeah we will take the proper action
Thanks very much
Thanks buddy
yeah
what do you think you are doing
is that any way to treat a convalescent
Subtitles by SDI Media Groupwe all start out with plans dreams
but things usually turn out differently
then what
you can quit or complain or you can cry like a little girl
but it won't change a thing
in India i once talked to a wise well man
he said that the plan will change you and if you are strong you might also change the plan
the rest is sheer luck
that is how he saw it
i never really understood what it means
my father always said if you let it come down to luck there is only one certainty
Whichever way it goes it will always swing back the other way in the end
but these are just theories
in practice it is
Shit
Come on guys
what is this
Lousy cards all night
do not be a baby
Take it easy
Get lost man
Fucking cards all night
Hey Frits
Hey Ronald
i happened to hear i was in the car so i thought I'd have a look

i leaned against the car and threw that piece of paper away out of anger
then i walked back over there went in and ordered a cup of coffee
this cup of coffee
all this happened while you weren't here Gerrit
i was busy and it took a bit longer
i am not going to make a big deal out of it but it is just not right
it is inappropriate behavior

you will get the rest tonight
Hey Ronald do you have a sec

i will have it done by Tuesday
Good
by the way did you get my email about the men's bathroom
yes
Makes you wonder who leaves them in such a state
yes very inconsiderate
what is the world coming to when adult men can not clean up their own mess
Just take today after all that coffee the can has seen a lot of action
is it too much to ask that people leave it in a decent state
yes
you never know what people do when no one's looking
FOCUSED a LlFE WlTHOUT DOUBT
that is rubbish
so how is life
Good
yeah same here
a bit chaotic now that i am switching jobs but

Lin
Mess
what mess
they were in the house when Simon came home
they smashed up all his toys
Dents in the sideboard
yes it is a very unpleasant uh
and such a shame about that beautiful old panelling
Fortunately Simon is unharmed
that is the most important thing
Did you tell him that Dad's going take care of this
what are you going to do about this
who is that Hao

Why
i will talk to them and make sure they do not bother you again
Wonderful
i feel safer already
i was talking about Linda and Simon
this is not in accordance with the agreement i have with this
Agreement
you owe money
it is called a debt
yes but according to an agreement i have with the Chinese responsible for this
i will take care of it
OK
you are just playing the victim again
you do not do anything that is why stuff goes wrong all the time
Let's try and stay calm
then put my mind at ease
have you been putting money aside for emergencies so you can pay this off
i will pay this off
it looks worse than it really is
in a week we will be laughing about this
we are working on an important case
you know what you should do
Read my book
Right
Thanks for that pearl of wisdom Lars
i forgot that you know everything
Stop it
we will go to the police of course
no
we are not going to do that guys
that just makes it worse
These people
of course you do not want us to go to the police
not because of me
the police can not do anything
they want money
Trust me Linda
what if they go to Simon's school
we do not want that
so what do you want to do
nothing
i can go to my mom's for a few days with Simon
but i have to be sure that you will fix this within a week
otherwise i will still go to the police
i will take care of it
for Simon
and meanwhile we are going to your mom's
me and Simon are

what
you made a string bet
what are you talking about
did not you see it
he put his chips in then he added some more
that is a string bet right
or have the rules changed
i did not see anything
Come on guys
a string bet is a string bet
you should have called it when you saw it
we have had two actions since
Rebuy or just go home
i do not ever want this dealer at my table again
what is the problem
Listen i finally get a good hand
Ace five
that is not exactly a good hand
what
i had an ace
with a five
Odds are someone is holding a better ace
but if you'd seen the hands i got before
Sure
so you mentioned the string bet before the next two moves
what no but
Cause if there have been two actions there is nothing i can do about it
yes but
what do you want me to do Ronald
Right
yes
Hey Ronald
yes a little
Ok but why do you want to meet all the way out there
OK
Go easy on the coffee or you will feel funny again
Did you have a proper lunch

i am with Tanja
Fine
See you
Take care
yes bye
Frits do you know where Ronald is
no haven't seen him today
what is he working on
not much i think
the robbery on the weed den
and that snackbar
i think
Hey Ronald
this is Bram
is this how we do business
Cool it
i haven't told him anything yet
i am not crazy
so what did you tell him
you are having drinks with a friend
you can not involve just anyone
it is not a school trip
i want it to be a small crew
i know
Manageable
if this goes wrong nasty things will happen
Very nasty things
yes i know you are in a tight spot
if you were in my shoes you'd have given up already
Listen i have been thinking i can not do this all by myself can i Ronald
Right
who is that guy
can we trust him
yes
Bram is my ex brother in law
otherwise i would not have asked him
he is a professional
a professional
he is a good guy
a good guy
yes
Like us
he needs money
but it will affect the plan Gerrit
that is why i thought
you said there is at least 30 000 right
Split three ways it is 10 000 each
then you have your money and we have an extra guy
Right
Bram this is Ronald
Ronald this is Bram
Sorry for the slight miscommunication
Happens in the best of marriages
Right
Let me begin by saying that starting now no one else gets involved
Let that be very clear
a small manageable crew
there is three of us now
Bram Gerrit says you can be trusted
this is the point at which you can still walk away
no let's hear it
Ok good
Sorry i need a coffee otherwise concentration
what can i get you
I'd like an espresso
Guys
Cold Chocolate
Espresso
Double
and a double espresso
OK
Coming up
OK very simple
Poker tournament in North Amsterdam
North
yes North
on Wednesdays they have a 500 Euro rebuy tournament
that is a lot of money
Trust me
on Fridays it is 200 Euros
on other days it is 50 Euros
Cash games
but on Wednesdays a 500 Euro rebuy tournament
OK
there is a back entrance to the office where all the money is counted
the door is always open
there are two guys
Unarmed
you go in and threaten them
no violence
that is very important
Threaten them grab the money and we will meet the next day at that roadside hotel
what is that hotel called
i will make sure you know where it is
that is it
Simple and clear
i will take part in the tournament so that i have an alibi
i will pay for the buy in myself and so on
so that is your contribution
that you will be playing
that is my contribution yes
People know me there
and some people know i need money
Hey listen i am initiating this job
i came up with it
i am just in a tight spot financially speaking
i am not doing this for myself
Just ask Ger
Hey if you are not OK with it
no just asking
Just want to know what i am getting into
OK
where was i
the next day we split the money in one of the hotel rooms
then we each go our own way all a little richer
i have calculated that there should be at least 30 000 Euros that day
we split it three ways fair and square
no resentments no complaints
Fine
Important no violence
no blood on the floor
Only as a last resort
no never
OK
Only threats
if there is no violence they won't go to the police
that poker tournament is still illegal
it will just get them into trouble
Tax Office questions
they do not want that
so they lose some money
Tough break
you see
Sure i see
one cold chocolate
for this gentleman
there you go
are we splitting the bill or
how are we doing this
Well i did not expect this to be honest but thanks
i am just glad everything's OK again and that Simon is safe

i have also got a present for Simon
then i have to get going
Hey Simon look
Remember what i promised

Great
Distelweg in North Amsterdam
they have the address at your station
Appreciate it
Bye
Johan and Emmie tonight at seven
and say hello to Jos
Hey Ronald i haven't seen you since
i mean
Very good
everything all right
Thanks
you look a bit tired
Tired
yes i am busy
Bags
yes bags
you know why
because i feel like shit Henk
is that OK with you
not everyone is as organized as
at least i have a life
hi you have reached Gerrit's voicemail
i am not here
HAO
B AND G LlGHTER
no Nico
i do not think i have anything to add here
Ruud Aarsman was not exactly a big player
he did not really have any enemies
that is what i thought
Ah well
it is probably just a robbery for the money
Still one has to consider all options review all scenarios
we are spending a lot of time tracking down witnesses
the third victim was probably hit by a stray bullet
Accident
Bad luck
Judging by his stack he was not having a great night to begin with
Look who is here
Well mission accomplished chief
what
Mission is not accomplished
anything but
Why do not you answer when i call you
Order something to drink first
no mission failed
what happened
what have you done
Innocent people
yes it is not right
People who had nothing
it was not part of the plan
Blood on the floor Gerrit
what is your problem
we have the money do not we
this is so wrong
so what are we crying about
this was never the plan Gerrit
what did i say about violence
Innocent people
Family
Children
Loved ones
yes those are the risks
Plans are made and then things happen
and so the plans are changed
a bit of jazz
that is how it works
we are all in the same boat now
what happened happened
we can not go back in time guys
we can not go back in time
do you think that is how the police sees it
the police
yes of course
Really
'Of course'
the police will just think it is an organized crime thing
Organized crime
yes they won't do anything
a shoot out at an illegal poker tournament
must be an organized crime thing
what do they know
and it is the North
which they could not give a shit about
they will just put some moron on the case who will take a look around and they will be happy if they can make a story out of it
oh yeah
yes i know what they are like
yeah you know everything do not you
Gerrit
hello
nothing for me
i am just sitting here
this is all wrong Gerrit
Bram
Listen let's deal with things in a constructive
so what is your plan
Plan
because i came up with a plan
Let's just split the money like we agreed and go our own way
then we lay low until this blows over
so you just come waltzing in here without being able to provide any uhm alternatives for this uhm
because i have a plan
what are you talking about
since Gerrit and i have been sweating like work horses
Hold on and you clearly just sat there on your lazy ass the money will be split differently
this gives me a bad taste in my mouth
a plan is a plan
Gerrit come on
no
Bram i
i do not think it is a good idea
Let's just
Gerrit and i get 12 500
you get 5 000
no
Guys
this is wrong
5 000 is not enough
i paid for the buy in myself
Gerrit lost his car
what
Why
had to leave it behind
they won't find it
do not worry
no
Guys
OK guys i think we should stick to the old plan
i
Bram i
i am not agreeing to this
all right
we are in this together we have got to get out of it together
Let's just put our cards on the table
our cards are already on the table
Bram Ronald needs that money badly
Let's not make it more difficult than it already is
Split it evenly and let the little guy do all the work
and you act all high and mighty
Guys
Let's just keep talking
i am talking
we are all in a tight spot and we all have to get out of it
we twelve and a half you five
yeah
you two put us in this position not me
i did not do anything
i work for the police
i can always turn this into a good story
oh you should do that
Ronald i do not think
you have to be really careful now
i can do the same as you
a bit of jazz
i am ready to negotiate
Just
Take it easy
Cool it Bram
Take it easy
yeah
Still ready to negotiate
Guess not
Acting all high and mighty
Bald fuck
not bald
Let's just talk
Acting all high and mighty
with that bald head of yours
do you want to act high and mighty
Bram
i am giving you a deal and you act high and mighty
i am not acting all high and mighty
they are calling the police
Stop it
there is no more talking
you do not get anything
Bald freak
Ronald
it is me
are you no longer answering the phone
Linda i was busy at work
how are things going
Fine
Great
it is all going
but i am at the station so can i call you
i have simple question
can we go home on Monday
what
Sure
i am
but can i call you back later
a simple yes or no Ronald
i need to know what the status is
yes
Monday everything will be just
Did you pay up or not
of course i did
do not worry
it is all going according
i have got the money
i will pay it off tomorrow and then everything will be solved
before i go back i want to be 100 percent sure that it is solved
we are talking about Simon here
of course
i know
Simon
Why do you think i
Ok i will call you this weekend
and if i do not trust it i will go to the police
yes you have said that a hundred times now
and you are picking up Simon from school later
Later
yes at three just like every Thursday
i will call you on Sunday
i hope everything is solved by then
Bye
yes
Bye
Ronald do you have a minute
so
the quietest room in the building
Walk down the hall go down the stairs and it is the second on the left
Number six
there you go
have a good time
OK
Let's confer Bram
i am not OK with all this
Things are getting completely out of hand this way
i think that we should just split the money fair and square
Just like we agreed and then lay low for a while
OK
Bram
yes i hear you
you do not agree
so what do you want to do
have a meeting
Ah no
Hold on
we are sticking to the plan
Let's just split the money evenly and that is it
Cancerous fucks
no not
no cancer Bram
Come on
Lousy lousy cancerous fucks
Well that looks like a lighter i was given by some one
OK
then we have a problem
that lighter was found in North Amsterdam at an illegal poker tournament where three people were killed during a robbery last night
what
what was your lighter doing there
Well i do not know
is this even my lighter
Maybe someone took it
there are a lot more lighters like this
Ronald please
i am just trying to help OK
yes i
i sometimes go to North to play poker
that is not right of course
but just to be clear poker is not gambling you know
Poker is a game of skills and
Wednesday night suddenly there were shots fired
i did not see what was happening exactly
i was afraid that i
you figured you'd leave before you ended up in all sorts of problems
but that is exactly where you ended up now
yes
True
Ronald what have you gotten yourself mixed up in
you know that you can talk to me
i know the dark side of life
i have gone through a lot
i was not always this wise
i was a wild one
i do not always like myself
Ok i think we all feel that way sometimes
I'd rather not talk about it
Fine i get that
now may not be the right
Let's start with your testimony
Clear all that up
but i also
i mean this is all a bit of a mess
so i am afraid i also have to suspend you pending the investigation
Suspend me
Temporarily
and we should talk some time
Confidentially of course
i am a good listener
but first
this is Peter
i need an interview room downstairs
Downstairs
a few minutes
what
Albert's got it
Why
Ten minutes
OK
i really need to go to the bathroom
Simon
Come on
Did you have a nice day
nothing special
Good
Sorry Roland could not come and play
Dad's got a very busy day
hi grandma
hi i have a question
i am rather busy today and
how much more
Bram
it doesn't really look like a lot
it is 30 000 not 500 000
who is that
Hold on
Ronald
do not answer
it is just the two of us now
when we have split this you can talk to Ronald all you want but now
do not reject it
Did you reject the call
you told me not to answer it
you should always push ignore retard
now he hears you reject the call
so
do not start with me
Hey Gerrie
you know who you are dealing with
i did not do anything
if you reject the call he knows something is up
Rejecting is a reaction
now he is going to call back because he knows something is up
because you responded by rejecting the call
do not think i am stupid
do not get all high and mighty with me
Hey
do not act high and mighty
Put it down
Put it down
Just let it ring
yes you are acting high and mighty
we are in the same boat now Ger
OK
i will go along
i will go along with your plan
no resentment
we will bury the hatchet
but if the two of us can sit down and talk as soon as possible
you and me
as soon as possible
' Cause if i can borrow the rest of the money from you
5 000
and you will have it back in a week
two weeks
with interest
then i can at least
i need that money very badly Gerrit
i have a lot of stuff going on at once
so call me back as soon as possible if you can
Please
i repeat
Call me as soon as possible
OK
Gerrit it is urgent
OK
Bye
These vans are stolen a lot you know
i always park it here
Free parking
Let's see
a black Volkswagen van with on the side
' Ron's Slot Machines'
then you must be Ron
yes
See
Taco look at this
i do not care if someone's fat
i really do not
but if that person is also really annoying a nuisance then them being fat also becomes really annoying
Starts to irritate you
you think and on top of things you are also fat asshole
' Get some exercise man
do not eat so much' you know what i mean
because someone is annoying the being fat becomes annoying too
i have that sometimes
you never say these things of course
do you have kids
yes two
yeah i know people do stupid things
they make mistakes
and then what
you get stuck and it is over
we all make mistakes
that so
Well i do not
you have never done anything bad
no
Well small things
Nonsense and so on
but really bad
no
Well i once messed around with a woman after i got married
Touched her breasts
she had these
OK maybe that was bad
but the real question is
have i ever done anything good
Aha
Aha Richard
that is the question
that is the real question
you must have for your wife
no not that kind of thing
something truly good
Aha Richard
hello
hi it is Nico
Am i interrupting
Nico no
i have got some news on that tournament robbery
you wanted to be kept posted
yes that is right
Well we found a car in the North
we suspect it has something to do with it
Quite sure actually
they probably changed cars and tried to set their old car on fire but that did not quite work out
i am going to the bathroom
i will make a note of it
Hey
could you continue your conversation somewhere else
Please
i am trying to have a quiet sit here
i have got a lot on my mind
i am trying to relax
i need to take a shit
yes but i am closing the door so no tricks
Bram no tricks of course
yes
Hey Ronald
i will split my money with you
i repeat
i will split
what
Gerrit my money with you
do not worry
i will call you tonight
where are you
i tried calling you
i repeat
do not worry
i will call you tonight
Gerrit
Did you listen to my voicemail
Pedro
Thanks
Fuck
yes hello
what is your exact address again no problem
OK bye
so you guys having a good time downstairs
OK calm down and think
Easy
yes Hao
everything
yes everything
Count it if you want
on time
Right
that is it
we are done
Well as i was saying mystery solved
what a nasty affair
Well it was not exactly an organized crime i can tell you that
oh man
the footprints in Hotel Montfort correspond to the ones found in the car
and the fingerprints found on the hash correspond to the prints of the other victim the burnt out car is registered to
in the hotel's bathroom we found 18 000 Euros with blood of a victim from the tournament
so you just have to connect the dots and the mystery solves itself
a lot of dead people for 20 000 Euros
18 000
yes
the way i see it
the two probably thought they'd grab some quick cash
got into a fight about the money in the hotel
one shot the other and then fell on his gun while trying to escape
not too clever
what a shame
but mystery solved
oh
i nearly forgot
it is probably nothing
but still
the two perpetrators and the van were previously seen in a roadside hotel
they were seen in the lobby with a third person
one of them drew a gun and the two perpetrators fled
the third person left a little later
we do not know who this third person is or what his link to our case is
' Bald' is the only similarity in the witness statements
it is being investigated but i am not hoping for much
my intuition says separate cases
Sorry
Sorry
Well
it is all a bit of a mess
i did some bad things
i
i had some money problems and
Officially i should report all this internally and so on
you should still give a statement because you were present at that shoot out in North Amsterdam and all that
but since that mess at the tournament is as good as settled
we have got the perpetrators
Case is solved
Well still some loose ends they have to figure out but that could take years
you know how that goes
Solved
you thought i was not aware you were in trouble
Alcohol
Gambling
Your wife
Weed
was it weed
Maybe we can talk about it some day over a drink
who knows
but it is no excuse to leave your responsibilities here at work unattended
i had to leave that snackbar Coja report up to Evert
Temporarily
but it is not right
Paul breathing down my neck i promise it will be fine and you are nowhere to be found
i understand you have problems but i can not run the place like that
what i do want to know from you is whether it is over now
yes it is all been solved
it won't happen again
it is
Really
you can leave it behind
Period
can you promise me that
yes
OK
can you do me a favor and make sure you have a full report by Monday
Coja
i will
Listen
a guy's walking down the street and suddenly falls into a big hole
he can not get out
then a doctor comes along
he yells
Doctor help me
i am stuck
the doctor writes out a prescription and throws it to him
Later a priest comes along
he yells again
Help me please
i am stuck
the priest writes down a prayer and throws it to him
Later still a friend comes along
the guy yells
Hey help me
the friend jumps into the hole right away
Guy says
what are you doing
now we are together in this
or no hang on
i think it was the friend who
Well anyway
you need friends Ronald
yeah
oh and thanks for the present you all gave me
Right

Mr Schmidt called about his bills
what do you want me to do
we do not have the money right now
but you know about these things
you used to find solutions for anything
i do not know ask Alain
i am asking Alain i am asking a lot of Alain
but he is my partner not my bank
Well what about the bank
you are someone famous respectable
you are a great architect
no no no i am not
here i am nothing
when we have signed with Bergoff we shall see but as for now i am nothing
but when are you going to sign
it is been months
since we left Paris two years ago
i do not know what happened
i feel like we are no nobody
we do not have anyone we do not have friends
we used to have friends whom came to visit us
we even had tickets for Roland Garros
i should not have taken you there you do not like tennis
i do not care about tennis
what i liked was having people around
Feeling like i was with them
Being part of something
Being in life
with everybody
but it is your fault too
you simply have to meet new people make some new friends
here
how am i to do that
i can not go knocking on their door and say
hello i am Elaine Briand do you want to be my friend
it is a desert here
Well what do you want exactly
we will sell the house for a fortune to an emir a nice house like this
then we will settle in town in a building with noisy neighbors a grumpy caretaker a broken down elevator traffic jams in the street
Life
Let's go back to it
because here this house
it is terrible
Elaine this house is me
it is my design
it is my model
but i can not live anymore in a model
Well anyways you will never guess who i met today
i was waiting for a client in a bar but of course the prick had to call and tell me he will be late
so the bartender said
Mr Briand
Phone for you
i went to answer it
i came back
then this guy approached me and said
are you Elaine's husband
Guess who it was
i do not know
Christian Steiner
Relaxed witty chic
Success had almost turned him rotten
oh so you met Christian
yes i did
what did you talk about
we talked about you of course
he has a good memory of your relations
Your work relations of course
yeah well come on while you finish tidying i will go
Hey i asked him to visit us someday
it is a good idea is not it
but you are crazy
Listen it is been ages since i have seen this guy
Well darling he came over to speak to me
i could not just tell him to Scram
Especially a guy like him
he knows everyone the whole world which could be very useful
we will invite him his friends and we will have a party
which should be fine as you wanted to see people
i think this guy has an absurd charm about him
he has an ease about him a look
if i was a woman i would really
Well goodbye
where are you going
i do not know
i am going to town
but you do not have a licence
Well i will go on foot then
Fuck
Fuck
Elaine
C'mon Elaine
do not yell so loud you will wake all the birds up
do not leave me Elaine
do not leave me
the weather's real bad
here we are
Make the girl get out

i am in a hurry
i understand sir
it won't be long

Pleasure
but everyone calls me Cappy
we are new here
See she is done
Excuse us for the for the trouble
Excuse me sir
Excuse me
Well there is nothing wrong there is no damage
you know i got in my car and then i told my wife

Bravo that is very good but this is enough
Did we meet in Neugeant
have you ever been to Neugeant
that is it
Neugeant
the name doesn't remind you of anything sir
oh what i am talking about it was ages ago
no i do not remember
Sorry but uh
i am in a hurry

Why do you ask
i do not know you seem weird
i mean not fine
because if anything is wrong you can talk to me you know
no no no that is that is fine
that is fine
do you have 20 000 FR i can borrow
i can not make payments
Well i will figure something out
but you know your house it truly is a money pit
oh you too
Why do not you form a club with Elaine
OK i did not say anything
Forget it
we will soon be loaded with money David
Look
2000 flats
the municipality will give us their agreement in three days
and according to Bergoff advices are rather favorable no
huh
Well i did not tell you everything but you know that they are investigating us
Military and judiciary records tax reports everything
i do not even dare to go see my mistress

Well i do not know
i am sick of this police state country
do not upset yourself
Hey there is no skeletons in our closet

Almost like me
my name is Christine

Thank you
you know you are my best customer you have every album i produced within the past four years
Well
i am just trying to remain informed
this is a nice house
yes
it is strange because it is definitively not you
but it is certainly David
he is the one who planned everything who drew up everything
this is minimalist architecture
some magazines even came to photograph it
did not you see it in Dcoration last July
yes it was in that
no i
Even Cric and Ploum were in in the pictures do you remember
Mmmhmm
Anyways i am happy to see that everything's fine
yes everything's quite fine
yes it is
but you you are so successful
you are in New York in Paris in Londres
you even have a studio in Lausanne
Well David told me yesterday
that is precisely why i came to see you
I'd like you to work at the Lausanne studio
me
Why me
Well because i trust you for the job
i spend my entire life in airplanes so i can not figure everything out alone
Listen yesterday you did not know i still existed then today you turn up like this
i do not know
but you were the best i do not know why anything would change now
and also i am ready to pay you at quite a high price
Listen money is not the problem
Elaine
Please
there was something between us you know something
something that would end really badly
Give us a chance
the thing i am worried about the most is the main drainer capacity
i do not want to see people with shit in their kitchen sink
oh no Mr Bergoff
i can ensure you that we carefully thought out everything right David
huh
oh yeah right the drain the drain
no there won't be any problems with the drain as
i will show you the plans it will be easier
hello again Mr Briand
it is because of the smoke
Well listen go wait for me at the bar i will meet you there soon
Take your time i do not want to bother anyone
Well about this drain you have every pipe based upon an idea that is very
Mr Bergoff is asked on the phone
yes

i can try to help you if you want
i went to see your garden this morning it is good soil but there is still some work to be done it seems you did not take care of it that often did you

Thanks i will make a garden paradise at your home
you won't regret it Mr Briand

Well that is what your door read
Well you know it bothers me

that is my wife
Hazel
Hazel

Doesn't want to bother anyone ever
Excuse me then i will leave you
i understand Ma'am
it is always surprising to meet strangers at one's home
i thought it was not good to mow while it is raining
Good or not there is no rule
everyone has their method
but with what are we going to pay him
no i do not understand
i do not understand
Why do we need a gardener now
a gardener
no come on

Elaine
Elaine

i think she took the little girl shopping
what are you doing here
i
i am resting

where did you get this bottle
Downstairs in in the wine cellar
i went for a walk then
Come on get out of my house
OK
that is fine
OK sir
oh shit
Look
Take a look at this it costs an arm and a leg for a bottle like this
that was my arm's fault
Fine fine fine fine
now get out
the wine did not only screw with my arm but also with my life sir
Get out
Let me let me talk to you
i am happy to be going home
hello i am Elaine Briand
we met earlier
in Neugeant we were working on some construction sites
and then one day
a building fell on us
and then
then
Well some guys got trapped underneath
and me a section of the wall ripped off my arm
and crushed my leg
i looked at my arm on the floor only two meters away from me and i thought i saw my fingers still moving
Why are you telling me this
because i think you are someone nice Mr Briand
because i want to talk perhaps
i went to the asylum Mr Briand among the insane
because in becoming only half of a man
it messed up my mind
and what do you want from me exactly
i want to live
i want to live a normal life
to have a normal wife
a normal child
to have a house like you like everybody
Listen calm yourself i
i do not understand what you are saying
Go to the Justice
Justice
they are busy building HLM
they are busy saving money on materials
they are busy getting money from the Swiss
oh Lord
i am so ashamed
Crying like this in front of people
you just drank too much Bordeaux
Maybe

Good morning
Good morning
i am glad to have a human being with me in this pit of baboons
Nice
that is nice what you said
has it been a long time since you have been in a studio
Well it is been five years six years seven years
Cric is seven so it is been seven years
Well it is changed a lot since your time
now we are in stereo and all
Anyways if you do not understand Willie and Billie will explain things to you right
Listen that is no problem right Billie
you are right Willie
Children stop the racket
Elaine yes the woman you are seeing who now looks embarrassed
from now on she is the boss the new chief
so for all your bullshit she is the one you will have to tell it to right
but do not rejoice too soon because even though she is a lot prettier than me
she also sucks a lot more than i do
that is all
now hurry up because your chit chat is costing me money
Bye
you want to play with them
you do not want to talk to me
everyone washed their hands
yes
Christine are you lying
no
no ma'am
i think you are
Go wash your hands
but i
one more lie out of you and you are going to bed without eating
Go
Come darling
here you are sweetheart
it is not tasty i know but it is for your own good
you will remain the prettier little girl
Come here but what is
Am i dreaming
These beasts disgust me
no it is Ploum my cat
Hold her
Get her out of here
those beasts carry a lot of filth and i do not want my Betty to become sick
Get her out of here
Mom made something for us last night

she is on diet
huh
what are you smiling at
Go on
Eat
Charles
Charles
here you are have your medecine
Thanks
Taste this
Mmmm
Did you see the work i have done
in two months we will have potatoes
do you think i planted too close to their house
do you think that will annoy them
oh we do not care do we
more
this will make a fine home won't it
huh
he is not properly tuned
Jean Franois can you check your guitar
it is not tuned right
hello
yes she is here
it is for me
yes
yes no
I'd rather take the call in the hallway
yeah yeah it is fine now
yes hello
yes it is me
no i do not know
no i do not know
no i am still a bit of a beginner around here
you should call back in the afternoon
no i will get some advise and i will tell you then
Excuse me thank you
Elaine
Christian lied to me
he said you hadn't changed
you are more beautiful than ever
but what
it is unbelievable
such a long time
yes it has been
yeah it is been seven years since Cric's seven right
Hey come on let's go eat
i am hungry
Come on
Thank you Christian
what for
Well
i am happy to be here
what are you doing now
i am calling home
Listen you can not keep worrying that your little girl is not safe at home
you do not have children
Come on stop it
you have to give her some time to get use to it
Come on let's eat
i am hungry
i am not wearing my jacket
it doesn't matter there is an umbrella
Listen stop it a moment
oh gosh
Come on
can we switch on the TV
no i do not want Betty to watch it
Why
Your mother probably did not tell you but TV transmits radiation so when you sit too many times in front of the TV you get cancer
what is that
a horrible disease which eats people alive
they become skinny
they lose their hair
Your mother did not tell you
no
Perhaps your mom doesn't care that you will get sick
Your mom might even want you to die
that is not true
then why did she leave you behind to go work
i am going to start tidying up
i do not know what you think of this but
i think we have to do the synth sound again
yes
it will take me a half hour to do another program
Listen it is not that complex
some people do not deserve all that they have
you are going to understand this because you are getting on my nerves
and why is not your mother calling
if she is coming home too late i won't wait around
but you have to wait until she comes back
what do you mean you have to
what does you have to mean
i get scared when i am alone
oh my angel you should have told me sooner
Mrs Briand please
Mrs Briand
Hazel Bronsky speaking
i forgot to tell you something really important
i have to be at home everyday at 6 o'clock
i know Miss but i can not do anything
my husband is a very sick man
i need to give him his shot every night
Well the girl will be alone for a time
no i am truly sorry but that is simply impossible
i can not do anything Miss
no i told you even today it is impossible
Cric
oh she is playing outside with Betty
oh we won't bother them
yes i will tell her that
so perhaps i will see you soon
Thanks
Your mom says hello
oh the most beautiful among all the little girls huh
the most beautiful among them all
Stop the boat i have had enough
Stop the boat i just want to get off
Stormy nights on the bridge's sides
you can fight i do not wanna get lies
Anchor down in the nearest port
any town doesn't matter what sort
Stop the boat this is much too rough
Stop the boat i just want to get off
i just want to stop the sound of your angry voice
i just want to stop this trip with its ugly noise
i do not want to be around on these stormy days
Thunder craze
Lightning fades Fine it is a quarter to
i have to go home
Stop
that was fine but we are taking it from the beginning
what now
Well we have warmed up enough unless
no yes fine
how am i getting back home
Cric
Cric are you in your room
my love i am back
what is the matter
what is the matter
Tired
what is wrong with my daughter
Mrs Bronsky left
you had a lot of fun today
it was fine
was the little girl nice
and the cake was it good
it is fattening
the cake
you are just pouting because i went to work
no i am not pouting
i am tired
Why did i even make this cake
who could do such a thing
this woman's crazy
hi
hi
Cric's in bed
yes
i do not understand she fell asleep like a baby
what are you doing
nothing
i am cooking their lunch for tomorrow
though she did not have a fever
i do not understand
Well she might have been running around all day
for once she is with a girl her age she might have
anyway Mrs Bronsky
i can not keep her
oh why
there was something she did not tell me
she always has to leave before 6 PM
yeah so
what do you mean so
i am still hard at work at 6 o'clock
yeah but it doesn't matter Elaine just re arrange your schedule if you are hard at work then
Re arrange your schedule
i won't change my life just to make things more convenient for this woman
you are not going to let her have her own private life
i did not say that but listen
i am not going to yield to her when she is inconsiderate to let me know
Alright so you prefer obey to Mr Steiner who never respects your schedule
but
but it is unfair
yes
Exactly
you lost your working habits and then as soon as there is a little bit of trouble you accuse this woman of everything in the end
what are you saying
Listen tomorrow i am going to look for someone else whether it pleases you or not
you are cute are not you
you were beautiful weren't you
but did you see what they have done to us
i completely understand Mrs Briand
this is entirely my fault but i will stay until you find a replacement
i am truly sorry but there is just no other way i guess
this morning i am going leave a flyer at the grocery store
yes that is a really good idea Miss
oh yes
i do not understand why you did not give the cake i made to the children
it is because of Betty Miss
you know i have to closely watch her she is on diet she tends to get fat
yes but that is not the case for my daughter
no but she wanted to be like Betty
you know how little girls are among each other
you know children Mrs Briand

i have got the feeling that she is after us
Tell me David
Your architect buddies from Neugeant they were called Antoine Wurtz and Roger Feriant right
yes
Look at this
two horribly mutilated corpses found in Marly's forest
Antoine Wurtz and Roger Ferrio bodies two parisian architects here it is
they are supposed to have been tortured to death
never mind never mind
never mind about Bergoff we are going to call the cops
you are not going to faint are you
Come on let's get you a drink
Remember this building that collapsed in Neugeant
yeah it was in'83 was not it
March'83
Materials were rotten it collapsed during the construction
there were seven dead
Seven workers
i am the one who made the plans
i sold them to Wurtz and Ferio
i was their ghostwriter
i needed money
i did not know
Well nobody nobody
Except you me and them but but they are dead
there was an investigation commission
Wurtz and Ferrio paid off who needed to be paid off and the case stopped there
there was not any trial
no it was nobody's fault
the building site was dangerous
Wurtz and Ferrio were
Tactful not to mention my name
but here it is there was a survivor
and this survivor had his arm ripped off
Your gardener
and you think he is the one who
i do not know
it might explain how he found me
is he blackmailing you
no
i do not know what he wants
he is inoffensive you know
oh yeah well he is going to ask you for something in the end
Well what we have to do is
first finish the Bergoff case
which we will tomorrow and then we will address this
i do not upset you too much
i always knew there was something
this has been eating away inside of me for three years
i never talk about this to anyone
Even to Elaine
i never managed to
however i know this is what fucked our relationship up
Why this
you are not responsible
i do not know
i feel rotten
i kind of grown disgusted with myself
i do not even dare get too close to her
Poor bugger
Come on go back home go back home and go talk to your wife
i can not now she is always working
then who watches the girl
where is your mother

i was afraid so i hired the Bronskys
Why did not you tell me before
i do not know
i was scared i do not know
because of this we have lost three years of our lives

Alain's right
we have to solve this ourselves
if the police get involved Bergoff will finally know it
we do not care
we do not care
it doesn't matter
we will get the hell out of here we will start everything over
oh no
no i do not want to
now i am even starting to

he was called David
David who
i do not know i forgot

oh really
and then i
i lost sight of him a few times

SchwenkstarWow look at this turnout
it is not every day someone from Metropolis wins International Peace Prize
i can not believe Superman hasn't won it before now
there was some question about whether an extraterrestrial was actually eligible
Alien or not it is about time
Why did not you go to Stockholm with Clark to cover the ceremony
Well you know Clark is so much closer to Superman than i am
Speaking of our hero
it is Superman
it is a great honor to meet you Superman
Thank you
Thank you very much for this generous reception
Councilman i would like to donate this medal and this prize money to the people of Metropolis with whom i share this award
because i am nothing if not a reflection of the people i proudly serve on a daily basis
Put a sock in it
you said the same thing last year when you stole the Metropolis Man of the Year Award from me
i mean
i mean how many awards can one guy win
Why do not i ever get one of these prizes
Probably because you are the king of sleaze
i mean used to be Mr Goode
that is right
now i am a world famous philanthropist
i have spent millions of dollars rehabilitating my image building shelters for the homeless feeding the poor stuff like that
so do not tell me that i can not buy this peace prize
i mean this is America
who is covering this fly boy anyway
that would be Samantha sir
then get her on the phone
Well i am through losing to you Mr Family Values
this time next year that is gonna be me up on that podium receiving that medal
yeah
hello
Samantha
Goode here
you better have something and it better be good
to be honest i am not sure what you expect me to find
we have been over this
Mr Wonderful cannot be that perfect that morally pure
my mother's a saint and i have rooted a few things on her that had me screaming
i understand that sir
but it is daytime here there is nothing but nuns and Boy Scouts
Well that is your problem
Your job is to find a chink in his armor
something i can exploit with all of the power at my command
now do not disappoint me
Well why are we just sitting around here
Fan out
i need some dirt
Johnson you ride down with me
now about that king of sleaze crack
i am sorry about that Mr Goode
i do not know what i was thinking
i did not mean anything by it really
that is okay Johnson
Let's just not let it happen again okay
okay
i missed you
Well i am not really back yet
Clark Kent's plane doesn't get in until midnight
Great
so for the rest of the day i have to pretend like my husband's still in the air
not exactly the welcome home i planned
Actually Ms Lane i had no idea that i was gonna win the prize
what kind of welcome home did you have in mind exactly
a weekend in bed in a mountain hideaway where not everything is done at super speed
and now this LNN special report
after weeks of stalled talks leaders of Eastern European nations Latislan and Podansk arrived in Metropolis today in an attempt to diffuse escalating tensions
the break came when the United Nations asked Superman fresh from winning the International Peace Prize to mediate the talks
President Kasparov it is an honor
the honor is mine Superman
it is only because of you the shining symbol of truth and justice that my people are even willing to discuss peace even though we have suffered far too long at the hands of our enemies
you have suffered because of the brutality you perpetrated against my people Kasparov
we have had promises made and promises broken
as have my people
which is why you are our last hope
you are the one and only person both sides can trust
Sirs if you will both be truthful with me and with each other then i am sure together we can find the road to peace
Great
he is gonna stop a war now
i think i am gonna puke
Mr Goode great news
i think i saw something i was not supposed to when Lois Lane was interviewing Superman
what his cape flew up and you saw his panty lines
Better
Seems like everyone's hero is doing some very unheroic things with a certain ace reporter
that is it
he is giving her an interview
Big deal
Come over to my elevator
i will show you something
no wait
Watch their body language
See how they are looking to see if anyone's watching
and then this
Interesting
i have done some checking too
Lois Lane has had virtually every exclusive with Superman since he flew in four years ago
are you saying that Superman's knocking red boots with a married woman
that is my guess
Your guess is not good enough
we need proof and corroborating evidence to back this up
we have never bothered with that before Mr Goode
but we are dealing with Superman here
so we have to be totally scrupulous as disturbing as that may seem
here is another Superman scoop for you
he is got a plan where he can get both sides to disclose the locations of their respective nuclear weapons and allow him to simply destroy them
which means they won't annihilate each other and they will have to talk peace
i like it
you know you seem to get a lot of credit for these Superman exclusives
what do i get
how about two days and two nights up in the mountains at Chateau Roberge
Chateau Roberge wow
the hideaway for the ultra exclusive and rich and famous
How'd you get us in
i have my ways
what is that
what is what
that
is that the hotel's confirmation letter
Well a girl has to have some secrets
Let me see
no
i am not gonna give it to you
Let me see
Let me see
Lois
Lois let me see it
i am not gonna give it to you
Cute
okay
that is not fair
Dear Ms Lane we are extremely excited about your proposed article on our chateau
but you are not writing any article
i might someday
so you lied
Clark please
it was a fib
it was an exaggeration
it was a minor distortion
okay i lied
but it was a little tiny white lie
Nobody got hurt
it is not like they are letting us in for free
Lois
Fine
we will take the moral high ground i will cancel the reservation
you can spend the weekend with those old warhorses
and get a jump on your peace talk
Wait wait wait
on second thought since their proposals won't be finished until Monday it is the perfect weekend for us to get away
Even though the leaders of Latislan and Podansk are set to meet with Superman the UN has confirmed that military buildup continues at the border
Indeed it appears both sides
Looks like you are not gonna be able to go anyway
i will cancel the reservations
no no no
Wait wait wait
you go ahead on up i will meet you there
Superman's gonna have a little chat with these two old warhorses
Get them to honor their truce
do not be long
Lois Lane
okay you do not know me i am just a pencil pusher in research
i am Samantha
and you are my idol
Well thank you
Thank you very much
that husband of yours he is quite a hunk is not he
of course he is no Superman but what the hey
you can not have everything
Excuse me
what is Superman like
Like
yeah
you know is he seeing anyone
because i was thinking if he is not that maybe you could do a girlfriend a favor and introduce me
Course i do not even know if he dates outside his own species
i do not mean to be rude but i have a plane to catch
okay sure
we will talk later okay
Sorry i am late
Long day at the office
is not it nice
Very nice
i missed you
i missed you
i can not believe i am doing this
Did you hear something
no it was nothing
Mr Goode you are not gonna believe this
Right after i hung up with you guess who flew into Lois Lane's room
Right Superman
and within seconds they were sucking face like world class mattress tramps
Hey
Taxi
Sorry
Sir sorry
what
the picture
yes sir i got the picture
i definitely got an exposure
i will get it developed right away
Bye
Think think
Hank's Photo Lab
Barry Dunning live at the scene of the crime where this tale of sordid super sleaze took place
People of Metropolis are saying no to Superman
oh my God
okay so this skirt doesn't go with this blouse
it is not that bad
you haven't seen this morning's National Inquisitor have you
that supermarket rag
Why would we
or the Dirt Digger
of course not Jimmy what is going on
oh my God Clark
Lois
that is me
and Superman
Guys let me just be the first to say i do not believe it for a second
it is obviously fake
the photograph's fake
it is unequivocally bogus
although it is pretty good work
i mean i have never seen anything quite as good
the lines all match
Jimmy
Sorry
on your team 100 percent
Lois Clark
in my office
Chief first of all i want you to know
i do not believe a word of it Lois
i know you'd never do anything like that to Clark
i have never seen two people so in love
this is just pure tabloid trash
it is that simple
Thanks Chief
now that said this thing's already blown up pretty big
now the Daily Planet has yet to take an official position but i can not sit on my hands much longer
the fellas upstairs are breathing down my neck to clean up this mess
so what do you want me to do
what do we print
Super seduction or lust for Lois
no to Superman
Formerly trusted Man of the
my guest is Father Morgan
i am Barry Dunning
in Your Face
this is fantastic
it is everywhere
they are all picking it up
every station every wire every show
it is even on the Internet
Superman's blood is in the water and the sharks are swimming in to bite
you are a genius Mr Goode
Call me Randy
because you just climbed up the ladder Miss Vice President
are you serious
as a heart attack
are you kidding me
it is the biggest story of the year
Superman's image will fade as fast as Michael Bolton's hairline
this is fabulous
and for the first time one of our stories is actually authentic
no no
but we can not stop here
no no no
we really must stoke the fire
we have got to orchestrate a full tilt smear campaign against Superman
anything goes even if it is a lie
the more outrageous the better
Superman uses x ray vision to peep at my sister
Superman dropped me while he was flying and i smelled booze on his breath
we do not need kryptonite to destroy Superman
we have got the most powerful weapon ever invented
a scandal
and we are gonna take Superman down with it
and then there will be a new Man of the Year
me
i am most concerned about the children Barry
after all Superman was their one undisputed moral reference point
if this terrible tragedy turns out to be true
then how can our children take morality seriously if the pillar of morality himself has committed adultery
is that the point you are making Father
Exactly
the consequences could be
the shocking story continues to rock people everywhere
i think it is a tragedy
i have got a 4 and a 5 year old
what am i supposed to tell them
you know Superman was their hero
i used to look up to Lois Lane
and i felt that i could really trust her reporting but now
this is all her fault
she is the one who seduced him
Poor Clark Kent
i think it is awesome
I'd be out bagging babes if i had super powers
i have heard enough of this trash
Forget about it
Let's just concentrate on getting to the bottom of this
the bottom of what
something like this doesn't just happen by accident
Somebody's out to get you
or you honey
Superman was not supposed to be at Chateau Roberge
Lois Lane and Clark Kent were
Well either way the first thing we should do is figure out who took this picture
it is uncredited which is suspicious considering all the notoriety it is gotten
You'd think this photographer would be all over the TV circuit by now
if there weren't more to it
that might be true
i guess it is just the price we pay for being in the public eye
you know every once in a while somebody's gonna take a potshot at us
Like last year when that woman claimed to have had Superman's love child
Honey but there is a big difference here
that was a lie
this is not
this actually happened
no it did not
this says that Lois Lane cheated on her husband
and we both know that is not true
okay
the point is that the rest of the world doesn't know that
and there is no way of telling them the real truth
Well then i will just deny it
i will issue a statement that says that it was a hoax
that someone was impersonating me
Lois
Better yet Superman should do it
he should have a press conference and say it was not us
the world believes him
Wait a minute
you are seriously suggesting that Superman lie
i am suggesting we do whatever it takes to get to who is trying to get at us or you or me
that is what i am suggesting
i agree that is very important honey but i think there is a bigger issue here
the truth
and the truth is that this is you and me in this picture
Lying especially for Superman should never be an option
Even a little white lie
Like the one i told to get us in the hotel and into this entire mess
that is not what i said
it is what you are thinking
no
now who is lying
Lois this whole thing is our fault
we have gotten a little bit lax
we have forgotten that there is not just two people in this marriage there are three
you me and Superman
we are so used to the suit being a disguise honey
but i can not disguise how i feel about you or how we feel about each other
Well if anybody asks i will just say no comment
that is it
it is none of their business
how long can this thing last anyway
it appears at this hour that the leaders of Latislan and Podansk have called off the peace talks because Superman can no longer be trusted
War appears inevitable now
it might last longer than we think
Live from the Podansk DMZ
Tension is high
i do not believe in Superman anymore
you do not believe in him
Tonight on Top Copy
it seems Lois Lane is not the only woman Superman has been seeing
Meet the twins who claim Superman's cape has hung on their bed knob a time or two
no
how you holding up
Considering i am one notch below Cruella De Vil on the popularity scale great
Everywhere i go it is cold stares and even colder shoulders
i think people blame me for bringing down their hero
Nice one Lois
if it makes you feel any better they are not too crazy about their hero either
the ladies in the steno pool are using a picture of Superman as a dart board
i am sorry i am sure it is really tough on you too
what is all this
Condolence gifts for me
Homemade fudge
some women downstairs whipped it up
i see
i eat crow you get fudge
half of me gets fudge the other half gets darts thrown at him
and now this special report
with peace talks broken down because of the Superman scandal border skirmishes have erupted between Latislan and Podansk
UN troops report short range missiles already airborne
Wait a minute
Sources now say an unidentified object is streaking to intercept one of the missiles
Apparently that unidentified object was Superman
all right Superman
Jimmy i need your help
i tracked down six of the labs that those rags use to develop photographs
you mean to fake those photographs
yeah
yeah that is what i meant
Good
i have done some checking too
there is only certain places who specialize in that high tech digital compositing
so whoever faked the photos had to go through one of those labs right
i will have a list by the end of the day
Great
you know why do not you just check on those first though
because i sort of have an instinct that that might be where we will find what we are looking for
Lois Lane
hi Ms Lane my name is Barry Dunning
i know who you are
then you know my show
in Your Face with Barry Dunning
Riveting journalism
Especially the show on cross dressers and the has been child stars who love them
that means a lot coming from you
i am gonna give you a chance to tell your side of the story
no comment
what about the photograph
no comment
are you or are you not having an affair with Superman
no comment
what do you say to those who are calling you Superman's super strumpet
they are calling me super strumpet
Care to respond
no
Come on Ms Lane
i am only after the truth
the truth means nothing to you
all you are interested in is sleaze
you are a disgrace to legitimate reporters like Clark and myself
and you are not gonna get what you are digging for here vulture boy
i am not gonna give you some sound bite that you can twist and turn
what my relationship is with Superman is nobody's damn business but my own
so get out of my face
General caviar
President Kasparov canap
Forgive my bluntness Mr Goode but i am a suspicious man by nature
Why are you so interested in resurrecting these talks
yes what do you get out of it
Why i get what we all get potentially
Peace on earth and goodwill towards men
and seeing as i was runner up for the Peace Prize i thought the least i could do was see if we can not find a solution together
Shrimp
i beg your pardon
Cocktail
Care for a shrimp cocktail
you said Superman would be here to explain everything
where is he
he told me he'd be here
Maybe Lois Lane got tickets to Cats or something
Gentlemen it looks as though we have been disappointed yet again
i would be more than happy to shepherd you through these talks if you will allow it
Come sit
Superman
you must call a cease fire immediately
there is nothing that this war could ever achieve that you could not better achieve without it
who are you to lecture us
you are no better than the common politician
you stand for nothing
i stand for what is right
and what is right is peace
Please do not let any side issues distract you from our common goal
Peace is built on the cornerstone of trust Superman
and if either one of us is to trust you again first you must explain this
and this
yeah Superman
we are all ears
Gentlemen you trusted me enough to ask me to mediate these peace talks
Trust me now when i tell you that this photograph is not what it appears to be
Superman General Navance and myself we understand such things
we are world leaders
but our people are not so sophisticated
they are outraged by what you have done
they won't allow you to broker our peace talks unless you can give them a more acceptable explanation
Mr President
Twist and turn
what my relationship is with Superman is nobody's damn business but my own
so get out of my face
Well there you have it from Lois Lane's own mouth
she and Superman are indeed having an affair
and apparently so passionate so intimate she can not even put it into words
Well talk about denials
i mean that one ranks right up there with Watergate
we are finished here
my armies will destroy you
Brilliant
my missiles will destroy you first
Gentlemen please
Enough talk
Mr President general i will explain and i will rebuild your trust in me
Tomorrow at noon i will hold a press conference and all your questions will be answered
then we can meet here afterward and if you are satisfied we can talk peace
but please gentlemen thousands of lives depend on you
no my friend those lives depend on you
and what you say tomorrow
Well then tomorrow at noon
i know i am looking forward to it
Very well
he knows something
he is got something up his cape
Think
Think think think
what do you mean
i mean that Super stud says he is got an explanation for that photograph
i mean what in the world could it be
i mean after all it is authentic
no no no
if he wiggles out of this if he gets these bozos to shake hands there will be no stopping him
the Man of Steel will have gotten a non stick Teflon coating and i will never be Man of the Year
i have come up with a plan that will guarantee the peace talks fail and make Superman responsible for it
i like it Miss Senior Vice President
so what do we do
i said no comment
Hey get out of those rose bushes
that is private property
was he faster than a speeding bullet
i beg your pardon
i am a married woman
this your first superhero
we had a pack of wolves at our place too
Jonathan Martha what are you doing
Clark said you two wanted to talk to us
he did
i just flew them here Lois
i thought they should be here to hear what i have to say
to say about what
this so called scandal is spreading like wildfire
i have to stop it now
if i do not war will break out and a lot of people are gonna die
so i have decided that the only way to clear all this up
is to tell the whole world the truth
the truth about what
that Superman cannot be having an affair with Clark Kent's wife because Clark Kent is Superman
Clark you can not do this
the only way to regain the world's trust is to tell them that i am Superman
i do not have a choice
do you realize what this will do to you
to everybody
i know it will be hard Dad
i do not think you realize how hard it will be
never mind about your father and me it is not going to affect us much
but it is going to affect you plenty
Clark Kent won't even exist anymore
you won't have any kind of private life
Neither will Lois
she won't be able to go anywhere as herself anymore let alone continue as a reporter
she will just become Superman's wife
i know i know
do not you think i thought about all this
this is not just some knee jerk reaction that i am having
i am trying to stop a war and i am trying to protect what Superman is what he stands for
if that is the case then you are making a mistake
what makes you think the world is gonna start trusting Superman again when they find out that he is been lying to them all along about who he really is
Clark there is a greater truth to protect here and that is the idea of who Superman is
if you tell them that you are married that you have feelings and desires like everybody else then that image of a hero is shattered
it is gone
People need to believe in that mythic truth
that is what Superman is all about and that is what you should protect above all else
and i will protect it Lois
because even in this cynical world somebody has to stand for integrity
and if that is what i say i stand for then i have to mean it
all right fine
then i guess i have until tomorrow to figure out who is behind this and why
Excuse me
Metro Air
hi
i am trying to find the name of a passenger who might've flown to Chateau Roberge and back to Metropolis overnight
i am sorry ma'am it is company policy
i know you do not usually give that out but this is Lois Lane and i
hello
hello
so much for professional courtesy
Lois you know those composite labs
i have been checking out
yeah
here is one
Hank's Photo Lab on Third Street
i looked into them because their work's not legitimate
Fake passports and stuff
Jimmy we are running out of time
Hank's used to be Dirt Digger's biggest client
so i did some checking
Turns out that a huge payment was made to them the day just before the photographs were published
so this photo could be a fake
Well yeah but you knew that already
yeah
no of course i knew it
i just did not know if you did
Know it i mean
if you knew that it was a fake
Right
Right
Well great
this is just great
Let's go pay Hank a visit
Looks like Hank left his door open
Check it out
Layout computers spectrum analyzers digital compositors
you can take this stuff and manipulate images into anything you can dream up
Whether it really exists or not
you can not imagine what this kind of equipment can do
i am beginning to get a pretty good idea
nothing here about Superman though
These digital compositors are supposed to have a memory cache
they should have the last several entries digitally stored
Just give me a second
Looks like Hank's doing a lot of business with the Dirt Digger
Hey wait a minute
his invoices are addressed to Goode International
Randy Goode
Bingo
all right see two different snapshots of you and Superman
now watch this
it looks like they created a texture map from these photos
they applied the texture to wire framed models designate the area to be scanned
Once they composite the images they can put you in any position
Instant scandal
Pretty amazing
you have no idea
can you download this from the compositor so we can use it as evidence
yeah
it will take me a while
do it
Meet me at City Hall at noon
i gotta catch Superman before it is too late
before what is too late
no
Put me down
no
you
okay so you are not my idol
all right Goode what do you want
it is simple
i want Superman to rescue you Miss Lane
Sauce for the goose as it were
and as he saves his paramour in predictable fashion a bomb will explode in the place he gathered those geezers
killing them both
they are meeting in your office
you are gonna blow up your own building
who would guess that i was behind it
Brilliant are not i
everyone will blame Superman for the blast because he will be with you at the time
this should discredit him do not you think
Except you can not make me yell for help and if i do not he won't come for me
Well that is very brave Ms Lane
but i have already thought of that
now if you will excuse me i have a mythic hero to destroy and you have a plane to catch
Nighty night
Sleep tight Miss Lane
is Superman faster than a speeding adulterer
is he able to leap tall tales in a single bound
when the clock strikes 12 in just a few short minutes we will finally know what the world wants to know
does the Man of Steel have a naughty little secret or doesn't he
Thank you Barry
and in other news
Gentlemen i pray for peace
now if you will excuse me i am going to go to the press conference and show my support for Superman
everything set
Lois is in position and the trigger mechanism is armed
for whom the bell tolls
Pardon me folks
a little snag
i will be right back
what kind of stunt is he pulling now

Fortunately light travels faster than sound
where is the boom
no boom
it is time for a trip out of the country
you and me on a slow boat
me on the boat and you dragging behind it
Going somewhere Mr Goode
we can prove everything including the faked photograph
what faked photograph
Lois
does Hank's Photo Lab ring any bells
no
Oops
Oops
what do you mean oops
Officers do you mind taking them
i have a statement to make
Oops
what does oops mean
the photo was a fake
what are you gonna say
i am gonna tell the truth Lois
nothing changes that
Ladies and gentlemen first and foremost let me just say that i have always stood for truth above all else
it is our moral compass the only thing that stands between right and wrong
everything that i am everything that i do is a reflection of that truth
as Superman i have never nor will i ever dishonor that
i will take your questions now
okay over here Superman
are you having an illicit affair with Lois Lane
Truth
Truth
the truth is no
i am not having nor have i ever had an illicit affair with Lois Lane
then how do you explain the photograph
the photograph in question is a fake
i have proof that shows it is all part of a very very carefully orchestrated smear campaign
if nothing's going on then how come Clark Kent is not here
he is here
Right there next to Lois
that is what that ring on her finger symbolizes
Clark and Lois trust each other and that is the only truth that really matters
now if you will excuse me i have some peace talks to negotiate
not bad
had me on the edge of my seat
there it is
the room's all fixed up
Good as new
Nice of Superman to put it back together
Did anyone see you
no
Absolutely not
i checked very carefully
so what did you think of Superman's speech
it was good
Did he have to make not having an illicit affair sound so noble
are you all right with it
Well i told the truth
i mean i answered the questions they asked me truthfully
so you are not completely comfortable
no not completely
there was a larger truth to protect here
and in this instance it was the right thing to do
Just do me one favor okay
Let's you and i be a little bit more careful from now on okay
it is still safe to kiss my husband though right
yes
Whoa your feet are freezing
Warm them up
okay
you missed

Chuckles nervously Chuckles W we have got the meeting with Watty tomorrow
Right
Watty White
yep
Hey you killed it at the 5 spot the other night
that guitar tone reminded me of Link Wray
Thanks man
Well good luck then
i will just be uh
in the bedroom
i will try not to bark
Chuckles
Well i wish i had better news for you but you are still digging out from the hit you took when Teddy's development went bust
you add to that recent campaign costs and expenses you won't be able to recoup without the income from the bigger tour
so bottom line Joe
Stop spending money
now at least the way you used to
you are gonna have to cut your monthly nut in half and if you do not in a couple of months you won't be able to cover it
you got assets
they are just not liquid
now another option is to borrow on the house
you take out a line of credit
that is a long shot
Hey look i i am in the middle of a campaign
how is that gonna look to voters
Lot better than declaring bankruptcy
that is a joke
Well we won't be doing that
Bucky Well Clears throat i mean there is this and i hate to sound like a broken record about joining Juliette's tour then do not be Bucky
no Rayna listen to me
you are just as valuable to her as she is to you
Alone she can sell out one night at the garden
Together you sell out three
Well you know what
i am just really interested in hearing our other options Bucky
Well there is always borrowing money from your daddy
Boy y'all really need to get some new material
Tea
what time again
next time can you make sure that you get the little individual cheeses
Like the square kind not the big ol' block
you mean the plastic processed kind right
i mean the good kind okay

um i mean yeah we can do anything in any given song but you know do not forget
Chuckles it is just me and you up there
we do not got no band

Mm hmm
it is just a much smaller venue Ray

that quiet intimate thing is what is gonna work
you mean like at the Bluebird
yeah
i mean that is what this is you know

Singing along  do not talk about singsongy i like that dress on you  the nights i cried about her

Daphne you figured out what you are wearing to the talent show yet

Hangers clatter Mm hmm
Mom what is wrong

Excuse me
we are in the middle of music stops
Well it is about time
Hey
Hey wait up
i am so sorry i screwed this up for us
Sighs will you stop saying sorry
you did not
you do not have to be nice about it
i know i blew it
Sighs no honestly you did not
Watty just told me
he is still gonna give our stuff to a publisher
what
Really
H how
he says he can just find somebody else to sing on the demo with me
You'd record it with some other girl
Well we are doing this to land a publishing deal
it is about cutting our songs Watty says it doesn't so much matter who is singing'em
okay
is it
Well yeah
i mean it is probably a whole lot better for me and Avery and um well you can just let me know if i need to do anything
if if at all
Keys jangle
Sighs deeply
Did you ask daddy for a loan
of course i did not ask him for a loan
you think I'd do that
he does know our situation because i had to disclose my financial information
Well you know you have gotta read this thing
it says i can not release a new record unless it is a best of
i can not tour until after your election unless you win in which case i can not go out on tour until the second half of your term unless you are running for re election which means that that year my tour dates have to be limited to no more than 15 venues
that is it
we are dealing with a crazy person
Mm hmm
Clearly it is not feasible
you know honey just do yourself a favor
Tear up the check
it will make you feel a lot better
you know maybe you should just talk to Billy about getting a loan against the house
i mean you were on the board of the credit union for years
that is gotta count for something
yeah i can try but you heard what Joe said
it is gonna be a long shot
Well if anybody can pull strings
Billy can pull strings
i will go talk to him with you if you want
Well no
i can handle it
i got us into this whole damn mess in the first place so just let me handle it okay
Clears throat
Deacon and Juliette  first smile is always harder  when you are leaving what you know   won't blame you if you stay here   waving to me as i go   i always wished the best for you   thought that you would see me through   my wildest dreams  yeah the ones you thought I'd never meet   still you would trade  your best day  just to have your way  all these years  and if you only  had one shot  maybe all this talk  would disappear  it is all  talk talk talk  talking in the wind  it only slows you down  if you start listenin'  and it is a whole lot harder to shine   than undermine   yeah undermine  Song ends
it is killer you guys
yeah it is great
can i have five please
yeah
yeah sure
Absolutely
Door closes Sighs
you okay
yeah
every song comes from somewhere right

Pretty emotional song about no one
Exhales
my mom
she loved country music
Raised me on all the greats patsy cline the Carter sisters kitty Wells
Rayna James
yeah maybe
though i never much related to someone who had her career practically handed to her on a silver platter
now Rayna took her knocks
what
Chuckles in a mansion in belle Meade
I'd like some knocks like that man
both sigh
you still close with your mom
she lives her life
i live mine
how about you

you said every song comes from somewhere
Let me guess
Starts with a ruh and ends with an ayna
no
this one's just
about me

i am gonna go catch up with you
See you in a couple minutes
Love you
okay let's go
Love you
Indistinct conversations
i do not want you here
Scoffs Well that is not the warmest of greetings but it is better than usual
i saw those stipulations you put on the loan
Why are you so invested in me giving up my career
Teddy's in the middle of a campaign and the girls are at the age where they need their mother
you better than anyone should know about that
Go home
Go to hell
Crickets chirping
Sighs
what you thinkin'' bout
i was wondering how this keeps happening
both laugh
That's'cause i am irresistible
oh is that it
yeah
that is it
Laughs
although it did not help me much at the Bluebird
what
i have always wanted to sing there
the other night
Why'd you call Rayna up instead of me
Sighs
i did not do it to hurt you
no i
it did not hurt me
it is
sometimes
I'd like to be that girl worth choosing so
Hey
i am here now
i do not mean this
i mean my music
if you thought of me in the same league as Rayna you'd go on tour with me
Y'all keep saying exclusive
that is like dating equivalent of goin' steady or Scoffs okay and what is wrong with that
are we going steady
oh come on
Just think about it
Chuckles
Think about how good it would be to just leave everything here behind
i mean we'd be out on the road and playing for sold out venues
Screaming fans
Chuckles
and then when we weren't we could be writing songs
i mean
that song today that was not just any old song
no
it was not
you know that could be just the beginning
i mean if you had to make a decision right now
Right now
Right now
Whispers Right now
Normal voice Well
Right now it doesn't sound half bad
no
Whispers no
Sighs and kisses
Man amplified voice Very nice
Applause fades Lowered voice oh hey uh they are up
Gasps
Playing telescope  Won't do you no good  if you run from me  there ain't no cheatin'  schemin' in my heart you will see   you left your troubles in  both harmonizing  my head in my head  you left your secrets  in my bed in my bed  you are like a cover of a book that is been read baby   i know your lie's coming next   coming next Mouths words  you can not hide from me  there ain't no tricks that you can try on me   i know your every move before you even breathe   baby thinking you know something i do not know   but my eyes my eyes my eyes   are like a telescope cheering
Whoo hoo
Whoo
 you are kissing her  when my head is turned not bad huh  Baby haven't you heard
Lowered voice they are amazing  See through my mask baby  every little sin  and everywhere you been  you can not hide from me  there ain't no tricks that you can try on me 
so i heard that daddy offered to give you and Teddy a loan
i hate it
i hate the whole idea of that
and you know now this whole thing with daddy and my career
what is his problem with me and my career
Sighs he hates your career because of mom
Why because of mom
Mom had a friend
a singer songwriter friend
Crickets chirping dog barking in distance
you mean like an affair
uh Exhales deeply
it was more than an affair
they were together for over ten years
they were together right up until the time she died
how do you know this
i read some letters after she died
i think her relationship with him is what made her marriage to daddy work
it was like
the two men together somehow made a whole marriage
how
how could you not have ever told me this
' Cause i did not wanna hurt your memory of mom
so your career and all of this it just
it just pushes a button in him
Baby just a few minutes
Gotta punch out
Keys jangling
Take your time
Hey man
you want a beer
Ll if you are buying 
so she still seems a little shaken up huh
Hmm
about the Watty thing
Bottle cap fizzes what Watty thing
she did not tell you
did not tell me what
she choked in the session
what happened
Scoffs Well to be honest just to say it
i think it might have something to do with you
i think she feels like if she really goes after it you might you know leave her
that is ridiculous
Scoffs
i know
uh huh
Chuckles
oh i bet you did
Chuckles
Really
Knock on doorframe
Keys jangle Knock knock
um
yeah yeah the the 22nd oughta work out fine
Listen let let me um
let me call you back all right
Well
i did not expect to see you after that display last night
you are not carrying any weapons are you
no i am unarmed
Chuckles
all right
so Sighs
what can i do for ya
Well
i had a conversation with Tandy and she told me about mom
Clock ticking
and her affair
and i wish i had known
i wish you had told me
now what is there to talk about
what is the point
Well the point is that you disappeared
as soon as mama died you were gone
you were out the door
you were off on some business trip or you were overseas anywhere but at home
you have been absent my whole life except for being just furious at me for the choices that i have made for the road that i have gone down
you have never been supportive and i have never understood why
Unless i am mistaken
i did pay for your first record did not i
i mean some people might call that supportive
i never knew that you did that
you told me about it 20 years later
Rayna
you are still my daughter and believe it or not i care about your happiness
i only wish you did not put it ahead of your own family's
that is a similarity that you seem to unfortunately have inherited from your mother
you have proven to have the same disregard for your marriage that she did for ours
i am so sorry that she hurt you daddy
but i have to say if you treated her the way you have treated me
i do not see how she would have had any choice but to do what she did
Scoffs
Thanks for this reminder
I'd never take a penny from you
Birds chirping Buzzes Sighs Click what
Man this is security at the front gate

Rayna and the girls they good
Fantastic
Growing like weeds

Well
I'd like to look into taking out a line of credit
Campaigns you know they can suck you dry
Gotta warn you qualifying these days bigger bitch than my third wife
but i will do what i can huh
Appreciate that
Only thing we are uh we are backlogged a little
our friends the feds decided to waste everyone's time with an audit
an audit
Mm hmm
Wow
how far back
all the way back to'08
you remember the good old days
the good old days
yeah
for you maybe
Chuckles
so let's get you started on some paperwork
Listen i
i hate to waste your time but uh now that i am thinking about it
i should probably talk to Rayna first
' Nuff said
i am here when you are ready
i appreciate that
i will give you a shout
Well i hope you will be hungry for the same thing
i have made every night this week
you know what
Forget dinner
what
Come on
Giggles what are you doing
Stop it
Stand right there
what
this
Just stand there
Sing to me
no
Come on
no
in the middle of the living room with a whisk
you gone crazy
no crazier than Watty White thinking anyone but you should be singing on that demo
you have been talking to Gunnar
he may have mentioned it in passing
all right
Sighs the water is boiling
i do not care
Let it boil
no
would you please stop
do not make me do this
it was horrible
i was horrible
that is not possible
no awful
Ask Gunnar
Everybody was staring
that is what people do Scarlett
they stare
i mean everyone was staring at you at the Bluebird and you did just fine
oh this felt completely different
i was standing on the spot where everybody who is anybody has recorded and i am thinking what what am i doing here
i do not belong here
who who am i to get to stand here and try to do this
that that is your first mistake right there
this is not about you
Look the songs came from you
but getting'em out there that is about somethin' bigger
it is it is a piece of you that you are like obligated to share
Baby you have gotta take the pressure off
all you are is the way the music gets heard
now come on
Just forget everyone else
Imagine it is just you and me in that studio
Hell i will even be there if you want
now come on
Forget about doing it for yourself
do it for me
Hmm
Exhales
so the good news is Deacon's got the contract
all right
and what is the bad news
uh the bad news is that your mom got picked up downtown near the bus depot
Apparently she got into some kind of altercation stole some food
i do not know
they found a handful of oxy on her
now look i know that this is probably the last place that you want her but until we can figure out a way to either get her into rehab or ship her back to Alabama
i feel like she is gonna cause a lot more trouble out there than she could in here
i am not avoiding you
i just do not know what to say
it is my fault
i do not know why i am forcing you to say it in the first place
Say what
Why do not you say it
Sighs
the only thing you can say Ray
that it is all over
Birds chirping Sighs
i feel like that is what i need to be saying you know
i need to
be letting you go move on with your life
Go do that damn tour if you want to
you know whatever
i am just
so why do not you Ray
Voice breaking because you and music
there is no difference you know
it is the same
and i feel like i am holding these hearts in my hands and i am trying real hard not to break'em
but my heart's in pieces
and i am trying to do the right thing but none of it feels right to me
okay
i am gonna go now
 if you were the ocean  and i was the sun  if the day made me heavy  and gravity won  if i was the red  and you were the blue  i could just fade into you hey
i wanna talk to you
me too 
i need an answer
if you are coming
i need to know that i can count on you
that you are gonna be there
 i could just fade into you   if you were a window  and i was the rain  I'd pour myself out  and wash off your pain  I'd fall like a tear  so your light could shine through   then I'd just fade into you 
you are a hard girl to say no to
Chuckles
Good
but i am gonna have to
i am sorry
Scoffs
is this because of Rayna
i do not know
you are right
you deserve someone you can count on and right now it is just
i am not that guy
Well i hope she is worth what you are giving up  Scarlett and Gunnar  in your heart in your head  in your arms in your bed under your skin   till there is no way to know  where you end  and where i begin 
Gunnar  if i was a shadow  and you were a street  a cobblestone midnight  is where we first meet  till the flights flickered out   we dance with the moon  then I'd just fade into you 
Thank you baby
Keys jangle
Please stay with her
Scarlett  if i was just ashes  and you were the ground  and under your willow  they laid me down both harmonizing  there will be no trace  that one was once two  after i fade into you your girlfriend's got it  in your arms in your bed we did not officially meet
Avery Barkley  Way to know where you end  and where i begin  i wanna melt in  i wanna soak through  i only wanna move where you move   i wanna breathe  when you breathe  then i wanna fade into you   Packaging rustles
Girl laughs
Chuckles no
no i do not like that
Lowered voice Look look
it is Juliette Barnes
no way  there will be no trace  that one was once two  after i fade into you did she just steal something  then I'd just fade into you wow  then I'd just fade into you
Sync corrections by wilson0804 www Addic7ed comThank you for calling Stenlakes of Buffalo
Please leave a message
it is detective Mike Fletcher Buffalo P D
Need to ask you some questions about a Darryl Kennedy
he said he wants a
Wii from Santa
you know what this is
it is already under the tree
Good
it is true what they say about the first 48 hours right
but Shelley Kelsey's out there
Everybody's doing everything they can
but they are not her father
i am going to bring her home i promise
Come on buddy you can not park here
Come on let's go
Mike Fletcher
Why do not you grab a coffee
i will let her know you are here
Hey
have some strong coffee
yeah sure
you know a fella who works here named Darryl Kennedy
you mean in the kitchen
no no
i do not know
a big guy
Assistant nurse
you are talking about Big D
yeah i mean i know Big D
a guys his size is going to spend a little time with his nose in the troph you know what i mean
you know him well
no
i know that he likes my southern fried chicken
that is about it
Hell he likes pretty much anything i put in front of him
i am not bleeding Am i
my boss is going to kill me i am sorry
i banged the shit out of myself this morning
Coming out from under the hood of my car
Thank God i am a better chef than i am a mechanic you know what i mean
i apologize for my behavior yesterday
i just lost control
i was way out of line
i just need to ask you a few questions about Darryl
i can not help you with Darryl i am afraid
after what happened i sent him home
and he did not show up for work this morning
no phone calls nothing
that is not like him
i will make sure to tell him you dropped by
no please just
what would he want with any of these
Did you write this
me
no
Well i can guarantee you it was not written by Darryl
or anybody else on my stuff for that matter
how can you do that
Accurate notation is paramount to patient care
Spelling is all wrong and it is medically inaccurate
what is all this stuff for
Nutritional supplements for malnourishment
Heparin is an anticoagulant
it is for thrombosis for patients with immobility
F S H is a fertility drug
it is injectable
i do not understand
all this shit's been missing from the hospital for the best part of three years right
the exact same time frame as our case
most of this stuff prolongs life
Maybe that is why we never found a body
do you think Darryl's holding these girls
Darryl did not write this shit
this is somebody else's handwritting
i think there is somebody else
Maybe he is with somebody else
what do you think
you want to know what i think
i think you need to go home
i think you need to stay your family
i think you need to get your fucking head straight that is what i think
oh Come on
Come on what
you had this for 12 hours Mike
you had this last night and you sat on it
you did not think to tell me about it
how the fuck does that helping me find Abby
that is not us Mike
that is not who we are
Look Mike
i have heard you and i am on it
Get some sleep
Trust me you will find Abby
hello
Listen it is only a matter of time
we just got to be smart right
See my dad is looking for us
he is looking for all of us right now
no one is looking for us silly
he is
i swear to God this is his case
i have seen your pictures on his wall
i know
he never stopped looking for you
okay
i swear to God
and my family will not give up
Shut up
this is your family now
no no
Please this is
this is not a family
you can not say that
Too late
Wait
we are in this together right
Right
Wrong
Wait
she was telling secrets daddy
Talking about leaving us
Said her dad is going to look for us and find us
but we do not want him to because we belong here with you
is that right
it is true daddy
Thank you ladies
now you are going to see how things happen around here
Again
God
you will learn honey
you will learn that this
this is a sign of trust
of loyalty of commitment
because without commitment we are nowhere
you are sick
i guess we are going to have to explain it again
so i hear from one of my girls same night Abby went missing
some guy tries to drag her into his car
a dark sedan
she cracks a bottle over his head you know
Hits him pretty good
and gets the fuck out of there

i have done my duty and i expect you to do yours
hi Commissioner
hello kid

this is what i want you to do
you see i am in and out of this place all day long
all i want you to do is answer the phone
if somebody calls tell them i am out and get their number
you can do that

here is another thing
i do all my business over that phone
that door is supposed to stay locked all the time
you do not know who owns the place you do not know where you live'cause i live there too you do not even know my name
yes but why Mr Kelly
Well you see Jimmy it is like this
i got a lot of big connections you know that do not you
yes sir
Well you see a man in my position he is liable to have a lot of enemies
you never know what they might try to do
Sure
so if anything goes wrong no matter what it is you get in touch with me on the quiet
but be sure it is on the quiet
and you do not know me at all
oh i get it
that is the stuff
and remember Jimmy
Kelly's your friend
a guy that will always stand behind you
and i will do the same for you too
K O Jimmy

Get a load of this
i am paying you 25 bucks a week
Whoopee

Hey say have you been here before
you are taking it pretty easy for a first timer
Nothing's gonna happen to me

Almost
Ever been in trouble before
no sir
where do you live
no place in particular
Parents dead
yes sir
Haven't you any relatives in this town
someone that we ought to notify about this
no sir
no relatives anywhere
now James
Obviously you would not have found yourself in this trouble if you hadn't been led astray by someone older more responsible would you
would you
now come James
we want to give you every chance to cooperate with us
now it is not you but the man who hired you that we want to reach
and your failure to expose him is really a more serious offense than the other charges against you
now come who was he
Nobody
Very well then
you leave me no alternative
i am sorry to have to do this
but you will spend the next three years in the State Industrial School for Boys
the new bedding number sir
do you want to come out and give them a speech
oh i suppose so
how many of them are there
Eleven
and two repeaters
two repeaters
Always the repeaters
James Mason
yes sir
13144
that is all
Attention
Mr Thompson has something to say to you boys
Boys you are here to be made into good citizens
i trust that you will take advantage of this opportunity
you will be taught a trade at which you can earn an honest living when you are released
Obey the rules and you can profit by this experience
Disobey them and you will be punished
in other words you will get out of this Institution exactly what you put into it
that is all
all right you
3172 lower
there is yours 13144 upper deck
first thing you do get in there
13974 upper
14671 floor
15682 upper
19243 upper
Where'd you come from
i got the bed up above
all right then get your things and scram up where you belong
i just thought I'd undress down here
oh yeah
Say
Hey what is going on here
what is all this raucous about
Aw something fell
Well stay on your feet and get up those clothes
okay big boy
you can sit down here any time you want to
K O
how long are you in for
do they let you write letters from here
Sure three a month
Why
i won't be here long
you gotta be careful
they read everything you write
what was that
Did the super give you the welcome speech when you first came in
yeah
Well that is some kid getting his so he can learn by experience
what is it like up here anyhow
Aw the food's terrible
but you can get used to it
and they make you sweat like a dog in the brickyard
Brickyard
yeah
that is the way they support this place
they haven't got enough money to run it so they make us kids work for it
how do they treat you
Well some of the guards are okay and some of them are plenty tough
they lay off me
i got a break
yeah
how
the old pump
it ain't no good
the heart i mean
i am lucky
yeah i guess you are
i did not think you brought me down here to listen to my charming conversation
Charlie do not let what i have said give you the impression it has anything to do with our friendship
i am not asking you to do a thing you do not want to do
you are only asking me to sacrifice my job to become the goat for reform movement
that is not the idea at all
what i want you to do is to be a man
you know what conditions in this school are now
you know how badly you need the money from this bond issue to correct them
and i know you feel the way i do
You'd like to see things improve
You'd like to see these kids given a chance
would not you
would not you
i could bring about these changes
but only by arousing public interest
by printing the truth
now listen Charlie this is something that is got to be done
i can not do it
i am not asking you to do it
now on Thursday i will appear at the school unexpectedly
with a pass
you do not know anything about it how i got it
all i am asking is that you let me see with my own eyes conditions as they really are
not the Sunday School act you put on for visitors
will you do this Charlie
i have got to be going Frank
Well Frank i will see you on Thursday
Thanks Charlie
Hey Jimmy
i am gonna give you two now
that is what all us old timers do
Supposing i do not catch'em
oh you will just smash a finger
oh is that all
Sure what do you care
you got ten of them
i caught'em
okay big boy
what again
Sure you gotta get used to it
Well guess that is all
Well i will be seeing you in a couple of minutes
where are you going
Get more bricks
more bricks
Sure
you are just warming up
Boy they sure make you work in this place
yeah
Say ain't you the guy with the connections
yeah what of it
i thought your friend was gonna get you out of this
Well he is and it is none of your business
Hey
you want me to show you how to pile up those bricks so it will be easy on you
all right
Hey Jack here is the new kid
Let's show him how to pile up the bricks
New kid eh
yeah
this is gonna be swell for your muscles too
Pretty strong all right
yeah
you oughta see me when i first did this
there
now let's see your influential friend get you out of this
Hey what is the big idea
who did that
i did it
you can not do that to him
he is my pal
what is going on
you do you boys think this is a playground
now just for this monkey business you will get no recreation hour
now get going
Come on there you
what is the good of my standing over our stove half the day if you do not eat something
i am not hungry
i do not see what Jimmy could have done
but Mr Kelly thought
Mr Kelly
while he thought and we sat here
Maybe we could have done something
now Emmie Mr Kelly did everything he could
he used all of his influence and he could not do nothing
what could we have done
at least we can go up to the school and see him as soon as Mr Kelly gets us that pass
Hiya baby baby baby
oh stop it
what is the matter with you
i just washed my hands and can not do a thing to do with them
Say get a pipe of that new backdrop will you
Gee
i bet you had to fight the women off every step of the way
no i fixed that
i got a police car
have you heard from Jimmy
no not a word
Well i guess he is gone for good
you know
i can not get that poor kid off my mind
how could a boy just disappear
i do not know
i can not figure it
Haven't i tried everything
Police hospitals Sheriff's office
i guess he just beat it
i do not know
i was just wondering if
Just like i told you sweetheart
he perhaps got tired of the city and homesick for the old town and just blew it
you know how kids are
they do not think
Say
how is it for you getting into that Derby of yours
we got a lot of staying up to do tonight
Just a minute
what a heel you are Kelly
Hey Jimmy
yeah
how are you coming
all right
Gosh but it is hard writing in the dark
i hope Mr Kelly will be able to read it
Say Shorty i do not see how this will ever get to him if i do not sign it or address it
okay big boy
you see i slip it to this big guy in the hospital and tell him the address
then he writes it on the envelope when he gets it outside
Say Shorty how do you spell terrible
oh never mind how you spell it
Just write it
i am coming to the part about getting you out too
we are gonna stick together
okay big boy
what is the matter with you
i swallowed a couple of peas
you are lucky to get peas
what about it
i need it in print shop tied
does it bother you any
no but i did not think it would be good for me to keep on working
Work won't hurt you
there is only one thing that would fix you up
i am beginning to feel fine
the water's over there
next
i keep on getting them dizzy spells
you are the kid that got that bump on the head
yeah in the brickyard
you will have to wait till Tuesday when the doctor comes up
but here is some aspirin
next
next
Hey you
you are next
Well what is the matter now
i thought maybe you could give me some of that medicine the doctor gives me
oh i do not feel so awful bad now
i think maybe i could come back when the doctor's here
Come here
Unbutton your coat
Come on
all right let's have it
Why your writing is nothing like this
now who wrote that
i did
it looks like that
you see i wrote it in the dark
now listen
you have been here long enough to know it is a serious offense to try to sneak a letter out
Especially one that criticizes the school
now you tell me who wrote this and i will go easy on you
if you do not
if you do not i am gonna give you solitary
i did it i tell you
all right have it your own way
you wrote it so you will get six days in solitary confinement
you could not put me in solitary
then tell me who wrote this letter
all right take him away
Come on
have you got 13144 here
over there
13144
13144
yes sir
how would you like to be a monitor
oh i do not know
we need more monitors and you have been recommended
if i were you I'd take it
you get better food better sleeping quarters and special privileges
of course you will get your responsibilities
i guess so
Well come on
where is Shorty
how should i know
you are supposed to relieve me
yes sir
those on the mourner's bench have two more hours to go
you have got to see that they keep their eyes on that line every minute of it
those on the chalk line can loosen up in 45 minutes more
there you are
yes sir
Guards
Guards
how do you do Mr Gebhardt
how do you do
i am sorry to have to tell you that Mr Thompson won't be able to take you through the school personally
however he is instructed me to see that you go wherever you want to go
i see
now what would you like to see first
oh it doesn't matter
now this is our correction room
the boys are made to study during the recreation period
what do you use the white line for
that
Well occasionally a disobedient boy is made to stand with his toes to that line while he studies
now these are our punishment cells
is there anyone in them
no
we only use these in case of emergency
more comfortable than i expected
Get back till i call you
now would you like to see the dormitories
no thanks
i think not
Well Charlie i have seen your Sunday School
so you have lost your nerve
you double crossed me

Better close the door
Why Jimmy where have you
Mr Kelly
Well well well how is the weather in China
Say you oughta let your friends know when you duck out like that
you had us worried
i tried to let you know in the quiet like you told me
but after the cops got me i did not have a chance
Shorty tried to get a letter out of the Reform School but
Reform School
Say they sent you to the Reform School
yeah when i would not tell them your name
what does this mean
Well when the cops broke in and found all that liquor of course i knew right away they were trying to get something on you counting your connections
i did not want to see you about that
but there is something you gotta do Mr Kelly
not for me
but for a kid that is still up there Shorty
he is sick and unless we get him out of there right away i am afraid he is gonna die
that is why i ran away
Won't you do something Mr Kelly
Gee Shorty's a swell kid
You'd be crazy about him
we got to do something quick before they catch me and take me back
you are not going back
no Jimmy
you are not going back
i will get in touch with the right
now wait a minute let me think
i got it
Frank Gebhardt of the Times
Just the man
i will go right down and see him
Gee Mr Kelly
Why do not you phone him
you can not settle a thing like this over the phone
Phone him and see if he is there
Say that is a good idea
never mind
i know the number
hello
Mr Gebhardt please
hello
Mr Kelly calling Mr Gebhardt
Sure he will know
hello Frank
this is Kelly
Kelly what Kelly
Why could not be better
how are you
who is this
Say Frank i wanna come right down and see you
Listen
i got some real front page dope for you
yeah
i got State Reform School stuff
Well all right
Come down and see me
oh no Frank i can not come to dinner
Thanks
but i will be right down
and so
Well let's go
you are not doing him any good by not telling us where he went
you do not want him getting into any more trouble do you
i tell you we do not know where he went
he said he was going to see Mr Kelly a friend of his who used to be our boarder
where does this man Kelly live
we do not know and Jimmy did not either
he just uh thought he could find him
i guess they are on the up and up
i guess so
now listen if that kid comes back here tonight you keep him here and call Police Headquarters
yes sir
yes sir
Why Emmie
do not you go well Emmaing me
you know a guy named Kelly that used to live over there
Sure
Looking for him
yeah
will you come in Mr Kelly
hello Frank
what is your game
what is the idea of calling me Frank
Well i will tell you Mr Gebhardt
i have been reading your column so long i just got the feeling like i knew you
Hm hmm
you know what i told you over the phone the front page news that is on the level
i know a kid who just escaped from the Reform School
this kid
yep
Your boy
Well no he is a pal of mine
what do you want out of it
not a thing
Except that he do not go back up there
i can not promise that
all right the deal's off
now wait
i can not say what i can do until i have heard the story
but i will do what i can
he is outside now
Bring him in
Miss Maxwell bring your book
Herman break down the front page
yes yes never mind about that now
Jimmy this is Mr Gebhardt
how are you Jimmy
Sit down
Take my chair
Jimmy could you tell me how you got into the Reform School and what happened then
yes sir
Take this please
all right tell me about it
Well when i first came to live with Uncle Henry and Aunt Emma
Say Joe
Did you haul Kelly his girl and a kid in the last half hour
no
have you seen anything of them
no not me
Say Art
who did you haul last
Why a young couple and a kid
and when i got to Mr Kelly i told him how badly Shorty needs help and he brought me down here
i guess that is all
Just transcribe that as quickly as possible Miss Maxwell
yes sir
yes
Telegraph desk just got a wire on the Reform School Mr Gebhardt
a kid died up there this afternoon
they say it was a case of bad heart
we are getting pictures
all right
i will call you back later
Jimmy will you wait in the outer office
there is something i want to talk to Mr Kelly about
yes sir
Mr Gebhardt
yes Jimmy
you and Mr Kelly will do everything you can to get Shorty out of there right away will you
we will do everything for him we possibly can
Thank you sir
everything we possibly can
Kelly that phone call
Shorty just died
Aw gee that will be tough on the kid
i can keep Jimmy from going back to the Reform School
but i can not do it alone Kelly
you have got to help me
what do you mean
Just this
i want a signed confession from you clearing the boy
what is the idea of getting me mixed up in this
the only way we can save him is by proving he was ignorant as to the nature of your business
that means that you will have to admit what it is and how you deceived the boy
i won't do it
you want that kid to go back up there
but i ain't going to Leavenworth and that is that
hello Jimmy
hello
that is him
Come along
Call Mr Gebhardt quick
Mr Gebhardt
Well gentlemen
this kid ran away from Reform School Mr Gebhardt and we are taking him back
Wait a minute boys
i am interested in this case
will you sit down here for about 5 minutes
Jimmy won't run away will you Jimmy
no sir
how about it
Well i guess
Thanks
yes
Well
Jimmy'll be starting back in 5 minutes
i can not do it
oh you can not do it
you made the kid believe you are the greatest guy on earth
and then you hid behind him to save your own skin
you let him go to Reform School because he would not squeal when you told him not to
and now you have got a chance to be the man he thinks you are what are you going to do about it
are you going to let him down
what are you Kelly
a man or a rat
you are a rat
will you come in here a minute Jimmy
yes sir
it will be all right boys
Jimmy
you have got to go back to the Reform School
there is only one man in the world who can help you
and he won't
what do you mean
Jimmy you did not know it
but the man you were working for was a bootlegger
the liquor in that place was not planted there
it belonged to him
and now he is too small too mean too cowardly to do for you what you did for him
are you talking about Mr Kelly
yes
Listen Mr Gebhardt
he may have been a bootlegger
that may have been his liquor but when you say he would not do the same for me as i did for him it is it is a lie
you are right Jimmy
you are right
you see Frank's a great kidder
he is got to have his little joke
i did not think he was kidding
Sure he was Jim
Get Peggy will you
Let me
Well kid
looks like i gotta go away for a long time
to to
yeah
yep
but after all it is no more than i got coming to me
but gee Mr Kelly
oh now look at it this way kid
we are pals ain't we
Sure
Sure we are
and you took it on the chin did not you
Well now i am gonna take it on the chin
and what happens
Mr Gebhardt gets a chance to clean up that Reform School and do things for a lot of kids
that is the way to look at it ain't it
yeah yeah that is the way to look at it
and Shorty
Sure that is it
Think of Shorty

in the honor of reality TV monster hunter extraordinaire
Peter Vincent
he who has no fright of the night
and according to his Twitter he is in Romania as we speak filming a new episode
on this week's episode of Fright Night
i find myself all alone inside the infamous Poenari Castle
Home of Vlad the lmpaler aka
Dracula
many historians have tried to find the unmarked grave where Vlad Tepes allegedly rests
but to no avail
so legend has it that a vampire still haunts the halls of this ancient castle

a history that when i am through with you you will feel as though you have actually lived through it
Ready to begin
Please follow me
this is very interesting
now believe it or not the most famous vampire of all
Bram Stoker's Dracula was actually a woman
yes
i thought Bram Stoker based Dracula on Vlad the lmpaler
in part yes
but why if there are no accounts of Vlad drinking blood does Stoker's Dracula consume blood and then seem to appear younger after doing so
Elizabeth Bthory
AKA
Countess Dracula
i am gonna find a bathroom and get a drink of water

down in the lobby in half an hour boys
first class of the day is at 8 00 a m
Van Gogh's paintings show him identifying with his subjects so deeply they merge into one identity
a single image of multiple people he turns into them and they turn into him
in his desire to transcend time and place he chooses a palette so vivid it burns into the spectator's memory and remains within him forever
Hey
yes Mr Brewster
i um
Like what you saw last night Charley
are we keeping you from your beauty sleep Mr Brewster

Why are you making it so hard for me to give you a second chance Charley

Go
Countess Elizabeth Bthory aka the Blood Countess or Countess Dracula is one of the earliest human beings rumored to be a vampire
Ed
Ed
Ah
Hey Penis Breath
you missed a good one last night
Hunyad Castle was the shit
Ed what if i told you
i had an honest to God real life vampire problem on my hands
I'd say you are fucked
oh thanks
Well it is true
if vampires were real we'd be no match for them
they drink our blood they can glamour us in an instant they run three times fast as us and uh oh yeah one more thing
they are fucking immortal
oh
oh God
OK
after saying all of that what would you say
who is he
not he she
Maybe the Queen she of them all
Gerri Dandridge aka Elizabeth Bthory
oh dude
Dude dude dude dude dude
oh that is not good
oh you are so totally fucked
what
Why do you say that
because she is like the ultimate she Bitch bro and do not take it from me
OK look
every issue of Vampire's Crypt has a Vampires in History back page where they give you a quick history of the Vampire of the Month in comic form
this is the entry on Elizabeth Bthory
Countess Bthory was being escorted across the country by her royal guard when it all began
the sounds of all hell breaking loose could be heard just outside her carriage
the countess finally had no option but to leave the carriage to see what had happened
the few survivors brought her back home where the castle doctor diagnosed her as vampire
Elizabeth's husband was desperate to find a cure to which the castle doctor told him of an ancient pagan legend
Only the blood of a virgin born at the stroke of midnight by the light of the blood moon could save his wife from damnation
the count ordered that his wife be unshackled at once
she would be free to roam the world and hunt all of its dark corners hoping that one day she'd be able to walk once again in the sunlight
but decades passed with no luck for the blood queen
her quest eventually took her to the shores of new lands
but the countless years passed in futility and the blood queen began to lose all hope that she might ever find the virgin she was searching for
Unbeknownst to the countess the country of her origin was pulling her back and Elizabeth Bthory returned to the modern embrace of her ancient homeland
what if we have actually found her
on this week's episode of Fright Night
it just so happened that the vampire never left
Take me to your leader
he still uses this lair to perform his rituals
Peter Vincent
he who has no fright of the night
Dude he is a fucking TV host
True but the dude knows his shit and like i said he is in town filming a new episode
about Dracula right
Correct a mundo Chuckster
so are we gonna do this shit or what
Double
Hey your producers told us we could find you here
uh oh
do i got to call security over here
no
no no sir
oh no
we have a problem
oh
oh let me guess
might this be of the things that go bump in the night variety
Like a like a like a monster problem
yes
Hm
Shayla Sunshine
oh ho
Shayla Sunshine
you boys do not want to miss this
Let me give you a piece of advice fellas
Monsters are not real
what
they do not exist
Trust me i know
Thanks to Fright Night i have been everywhere from the Himalayas to Haiti
i have sought out everything from yetis to zombies to trolls to werewolves and every time nothing
so there is nothing you can do
no advice you can give us from all the times you have monster hunted
Actually i do have a piece of advice for you
i was once in Saudi Arabia looking for a djinn and the whole thing went kablooey on me
had to hitch a ride on a freighter to get back home
Always make sure your check clears before you show up
so what if we paid you
what are you talking about Evil
yeah Evil what are you talking about
we all have needs man
mine are comic books and horror movies
Charley's is Amy Peterson's pussy
Yours is money and strippers in no particular order
Let's get you some of the ol' greenbacks and get down to business
how many greenbacks we talking about Evil
yeah Evil how many greenbacks are we talking about
how many greenbacks do you normally charge
do you know what
can we please stop saying greenbacks
how much moola do i usually charge for what Evil
you know an appearance a kind of assessment
you want him to assess her
Well why not
if she really is a vampire who better than the great Peter Vincent to make that distinction
and even more likely if she is not a vampire our boy here can also make that call based on the fact that he is the world's foremost expert on not monsters
Thank you so much
i would love to
Ouch
i knew i should not have taken the crew out for drinks last night
two thousand dollars
what
there is no way
Done
Done

Charley thinks Gerri is a vampire
i already had my suspicions about her
and sure enough i was right
her apartment is a total vampire's lair

i actually saw her feed on somebody
and then bam
Stake in the heart
Just like you did on the season two Vampire Special

Three thousand bucks is not a bad price
OK so supposing you are right supposing you are not lying

Wait wait wait
Your house
my home Charley
my real one
no
Amy
no
another shot Dragomir
i got to take a pit stop
hello
is anybody in here
oh fuck
you are pathetic Peter Vincent
you are a joke
a sham
you host the greatest monster show on TV but you do not believe in monsters
i believed in you you bastard
i believed in your shitty little show more than you ever did you piece of shit
i am gonna make you bleed motherfucker
Sorry kid
Bleeding is believing
Ah
Come here
Kiss the cross bitch
Kiss the cross vampire boy
Kiss the cross
that was nasty
Phew
Let go of me
Help me
Let me go
Let me go
Help me
Let go
where is Peter
Put the Old Testament over there
Old Testament over there
more garlic on the side too
Catch
Peter
Stop him
it is me Charley
Back the fuck up
i will fucking use this motherfucker
what the hell Peter
are you one of them or not
them
a vampire
of course i am not a vampire
Satisfied
Let him in
what the hell is that
it is a Stake O Fix
the weapon that is said to have killed Vlad the lmpaler aka motherfucking Dracula
and you got it how
Stole it from the props department
what is with the change of heart
Change of heart
i thought you did not believe in monsters
Bleeding is believing
what so you are just running away
as soon as the sun comes up as fast as i fucking can
but Gerri's taken Amy to her home to Cachtice Castle
i think she is gonna kill her
i wish i could help kid
you can
but i won't
oh fuck
Wait
Wait
i wanted to tell you
there still might be a way for you to save Amy
as long as she is still alive of course
what are you doing
Preparing you for the ceremony
Tonight i will bathe in the blood of a virgin herself born at the stroke of midnight by the light of the blood moon
how do you know that i am
that you are a virgin
no
how do you know that i was born at exactly midnight during a blood moon
i can taste it
in your blood
and after you'd no longer be a vampire
oh I'd still be a vampire but I'd be free
Free to walk in the daylight
Free to feel the sun on my skin
what does Charley have to do with this
in order for the ceremony to work the sacrifice's blood must be pure
you yourself must kill that which you love
who says i love Charley
i won't hurt him
if you do not you will die
you must kill him
you can not make me do that
it is not up to you
Holy water garlic
all right
According to traditional mythology if you kill a vampire before the sun comes up anyone he or she has bitten that night will return back to their human form
now legend talks about a bathhouse deep in the bowels of Cachtice Castle
Bthory can be defeated in that pit at the break of dawn
but you do not want to find yourself down there alone
Charley
is that you
Charley i am over here
Please just come here
Amy
Charley
Amy

Hey Peter

had to make sure the check cleared kid
Come on
no wait
Wait
what
i bought you something
Charley
do not peek
what
Really
oh my God
Charley it is beautiful
Thank youStimuli
an episodic film by
the Discovery
Dedicated to Charles Chaplin
to me stimuli are sex and narcotics
i think it is the same for many other people
but i have decided to sublimate myself
so the voyage to my childhood becomes my stimulus
not my own childhood
it is not very stimulating compared to another man's childhood that in turn stimulated him and delighted all of us
Charlie Chaplin
Widen the circle guys so everybody gets an opportunity
a bit larger than that
a bit larger
Get in on the side
Widen the circle
i never got to meet Charlie Chaplin
i had to find his neighborhood instead where he lived as a child
i was looking for Parnell Terrace which is no longer on any map and is hardly remembered by anybody
it is mainly money but also the idea of making a pornographic film in a different way than what is usually associated with pornography
Once upon a time there were two lovers who wanted to come in to a warm room and a comfortable bed in order to
she Harried Andersson
he
Sven Bertil Taube
Let's take a bath first
first of all
let's have some champagne
yes let's
where is the bathroom
Champagne
i have found it
are you sure that is everything
i will wash my hair first
Come here and you
Come in
we are in here
we will just have it here
one glass there and one there
Good afternoon
Good day
Thank you
you are welcome
are you comfortable
Accidents happen
Band Aid
that is just fine
that is incredibly fine
now she was content
she had brushed him all over and cut his cheek and shaved his armpits
Only the feet and the teeth remained and the hair and the blackheads and the perfumes
then they'd find out together if they really loved each other
See how tenderly she mends his toes and how tenderly he waits
are you done yet
Tired of cleanliness
no
i am a bit tired of waiting
Good things come to those who wait
i am so sleepy
could you call for the evening papers
Come here
i just have to solve this problem
are not you going to come to little me then
Chess goes well when you are clean
this is actually not going to be about fireworks
it is not that i do not like fireworks but it is not going to be about them
it is going to be about something completely different
it is not going to be a story either in the normal sense of the word but more like an account
yes
Account might not be the proper word either
more accurately i want to put things in relation to each other
Things that normally are not considered related at all against each other or beside each other
it might sound as though i haven't thought this through
i do not know
the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said that language often disguises thought
and that one can not judge the shape of one's thoughts by the shape of one's disguise their inner form that is
because the outer shape was never meant to reveal the inner shape
he also said
the boundaries of my language are
the boundaries of my world as well
all that we see
could be different
my head hurts
it is never quiet
Just round and round all the time till i am dizzy and my ears are ringing
i can not take any more
the sculptor Berto Marklund once said about it that its beauty is not overshadowed by its ability to reach 280 km h
i think that is the right point of view
that the outer beauty is correspondant to an inner is one thing he might not have realised
Berto is a sculptor and erects the aspects of his trade on objects
he is exceptionally open minded
Why do they keep coming here
Nearly every year somebody gets killed
87 people died in 1955 when a driver
lost control over his car
they should know better than to come here
that would be a disgusting way to die
Bofors aiming for export
our technology your safety
Motors have always interested me
i have constructed a few myself
this is the last one number six
yes number six
it says so here
it is a sort of compensation
it should work
it is pretty advanced
it is nothing special really
two pistons are pumping in the same cylinder
it is a two stroke engine
i have eliminated the crankcase compression and put this under the pistons instead to increase pressure
i have shifted the pistons' movement in the cylinder in relation to each other
here is a diagram
it is a photostat copy
it is a bit blurred
i can not explain
Ford competed as well
an intense feeling of being alive for a moment a greatly increased euphoria for a few hours' time or less
Perhaps for a great cost
Reckless one could argue
a type of narcomania
an escape from reality or at least the parts of reality that one can not handle
one cost will always remain
the after effects always appear
sometimes one's entire body is shaking from weakness from all the concentration and excitement that have nothing to do with sexuality if one ever had thought so
one can be haunted at night by images of what could've been
Rides filled with near accidents
but a replacement a more socially responsible one what would it look like
i have tried to imagine one but i have failed
nothing is more tangible than this
it is five kilometers long
they say it feels as thought it will never end but it will
it is a struggle
one has to gather every ounce of will power and skill
Confrontations
he who intensly fights for his life will also have an intense experience
Good day
i am going to show you a little film about my son Daniel Sebastian
it takes place between about a month before his birth and the day when he becomes two years old on the afternoon when he has just
lain down in the hammock to rest up from all the festivities together with his grandmother
from a material of several thousand meters filmed as you will see with a hand held camera on 16 mm film
i have edited and selected a concentrate that mainly is centered on Daniel's face
you see Daniel's face is to me the most beautiful and perhaps the most stimulating thing there is
Let's see how it turned out
Orno in August
Easter in Djursholm
Daniel's mother is playing
i was writing on a film that summer
it was never made
but there is a passage from that film that I'd like to read here and that has a great lot to do with Daniel Sebastian
no more words like prisoner prison torture jailer walls confined distance emptiness fear ghost
no words like judgement punishment forgiveness guilty erring guilt shame sin
no punishments executioners and saints
no confessions nightmares and acts of vengeance
Why did ever the thought of a fair and vengeful God occur
the prayer's cry of anguish the watchfulness or blind rage of the faith
from what fear of putrefaction did this monstrosity called absolution arise
the resurrection of the dead and eternal life
to reach a person instead to envelop her to experience her with her thousand and thousand variations
to live together in a common reality
at his grandmother's on his second birthday
Introducing one of the world's most celebrated singers
Birgit Nilsson
Distinguished not only as an artist but as a person
her role in a film like this is evident
as a practising artist she has stimulated her audience and as an exuberant personality stimulated her surroundings
Stig Westerberg is conducting the radio orchestra
i miscounted
oh
i was idly listening
it was my fault
Absolutely my fault
the fault was all mine
do you think it is loud enough
Sure it is
yes down here
yes
yes but i meant over there
can you hear me
can you hear me
Even on the low notes
Even when Birgit is singing a low note
the deeper pitches
i definitely think so
but do not raise it just because of that
the accompaniment is great
you have no idea what orchestras i have had to struggle with
Like horrible thunderstorms
some egoistic conductors think that the orchestra is the main part of an opera
i think the singer and the orchestra are equally important
Thank you
we are glad to hear it
Let's see
that was not important
the tempo was fine now was not it
oh yes
Nice and calm
that is right
Just as in the notes
Just right
a nice balance
now in the end here
i had to disturb the tempo for your sake
for my sake
what was it
yes it says salige Schlumpfen
you see it has to widen
i need some breathing room
or else it won't work
i thought about it too
i will look out for it
there is a double h a pronounced h
is that on the sheets
it is not
it is forte
Forte and piano
first forte then piano
that is Erik
where is that
can you do that
yes
and Erik
not a note right on this
it is warm in here
Stimulated schmimulated
it is not easy to be stimulated by these small assignments that get between the bigger things that have to be done
we just took some old story by some German called Honor de Balzen
Balzac
yes Balzac
he was French i think
Balzat
Balzanc yes
we just chose him because we do not really have time with this so we just took some story that already existed
it is also fun to show off that you have read books
yes it is
to show you are not just farting around
so we filmed it
Ended up at 7 8 minutes or so
Lena Granhagen is fun to work with
yes she is nice
the Rewards of Chastity
i have been raped
Come in
Sir lawyer you must help me
what is it
something horrible has happened
Miss Sofie are you here for the laundry today
i wanted to wear this shirt now
no
i need justice
i have been deprived of my virginity
Well what do you know
i can not do much about that
but he forced me
he started groping me
yes of course
have a seat beside me Miss Sofie
now tell me about it from the top
i was carrying the laundry as usual and he sauntered about in his nice silk morning robe
he was beaming
i was just going to leave the shirts in the secretaire
he came from behind and started picking on the starched shirt breasts
he said you have starched your share of breasts right
yes i said
i truly have
yes he said
so have i
and so he did it
what
Touched my breasts
Ah of course
and then he tickled me here
of course
i started laughing of course
i am ticklish
then he pulled up my skirts
i shouted that that is no way to behave
no he said
this is the way
and then he did it
i see
you had a good time then
no
i shouted as loud as i could and i resisted the entire time
those strugglings are just a trick to spur the men
i swear i did not want to
he forced me
it was not nice at all
no girl is doing that against her will
if she doesn't want to it doesn't happen
could you help me with this yarn
Sure
Just take one end and help me out
i can not see that well
but it is true
i am so unhappy
so you want to see your seducer in jail
no that is too harsh on him
although he only gave me two francs
so that is your issue
so how much is it worth
two hundred francs
i won't take your case
i do not believe in rape
you have to prove that it is plausible
two hundred francs is a lot
who is he
Chamberlain Ankarstj rna
a big handsome man
he is rolling in money
he has silk shirts from Paris
Chamberlain huh
there is a lot of money in this
but you have to be sure about it
i do not think i will take this case
i do not believe in rape
you should either get pleasure or money
there must be some justice in this world
but you need evidence Miss
he tore and pushed me until i was all dizzy
that could be worth two hundred francs right
i will take the case Miss
the Necklace with
what stimulated you into doing this particular film
it was Swedish Film Industry's kind invitation to contribute to Stimulantia
i gladly accepted
you do not say no to a good offer
i was a bit reluctant since i had retired after many years of making film and had considered film to be a closed chapter for me
but Guy de Maupassant's short story the Necklace tempted me and it is always nice to yield to temptation
two circumstances made me change my mind
first of all Ingrid Bergman had promised to play the main part
my collaboriation with Ingrid that started in 1934 when she was in Swedenhielms with G sta Ekman would after 30 even years come to an end in my definitely last film
Lovely meat pudding
i must have some more
it is my favorite dish
yes i know
Sure you know that
Thank you
you have been saying that for ten years now
yes time flies
Even in the royal departments
i though it had stopped there
not for us minor officials
on the contrary it passes too quickly
the paper work builds up and we can not keep up
i know that
Sure you know that
i have mentioned that too
what do you want
i did not call
i thought I'd take your plates
can not you see that he is still eating
Gosh
i am almost done
yes there we are
Thank you
it is even worse than it usually is today
i saw Jeanette Ribbing today
what clothes what jewelry
she was so beautiful
you are much more beautiful
oh sure
the way i am dressed
the Ribbings have money Matilde
yes and we do not
i know that
Your childhood friend married well
i was not a good match as your parents pointed out from time to time
but we are getting by
you are happy as long as you get your meat pudding and get to go hunting with your superiors once in a while
but i do not hunt and i do not think meat pudding is a break from this monotony
nothing happens here
it is so gray and boring and there is nothing fun or beautiful around us
on our evening walks when i see lit up windows
i think i can see myself in the light of the cut glass chandeliers
i can hear myself laugh
People address me and smile at me and speak so beautifully
the floors are shining and the rugs are soft and the furniture is so comfortable
someone is playing a waltz on the grand piano
someone comes towards me and bows to me and everything swirls around and around and past
Matilde
you say my name and everything gets cold
i feel that i am standing in the street and the windows are closed
now i am alone
i am with you
where are you Matilde
here
Home already
oh you are there
Look at this
it is something for you
for me
an invitation card
an invitation card
yes and pretty distinguished
Under secretary of State Emmanuel Bjelke and wife herewith have the honor of inviting Mr and Mrs Hackman to supper with dance at his house and at Djurg rden
Saturday the 4th of July
but that is not for me
i thought you'd be happy
not many of the subordinates get invited
you will get to see the high society
but what should i wear
i did not think of that
what about the dress you wear to the theatre
what is the matter
what is it
nothing
i do not have anything to wear so i can not go
Let's think about this
how much could a dress be
not the most expensive one
i do not know
for a hundred maybe
you see
i will get the money
i will get it
what do you think
Wait let me help you
you are so beautiful
it is beautiful
but something is missing
what is
it looks so bare without a necklace
i do not have anything that goes together with this
i have nothing to put on
i look so hopelessly poor
how about a flower
it is not that uncommon
no then they will understand that i do not have anything else
it is so humiliating to look poor among rich women
could not you borrow a necklace
from whom
Jeanette Ribbing for example
but she would not
but i could not Sure you can
Good friends like you
Maybe so
Help me with this
i could always give it a try
i will go over there
i will be right with you
i am just looking for the key
Go ahead and play
i do not play any more
no touchie
here you go
you can pick anyone you like
Go ahead try them on
have a seat
i hope you will find one that you really like
here
it is so good to see you
you never come over even though i always ask you
we lead so different lives
that doesn't matter
yes it does
my life is so ugly compared to yours
my dear
it is very beautiful
yes it is
Keep looking
Look at this one
Try it on
there is a mirror over there
so what do you think
would you lend me this
Only this
of course
i am glad to
it is incredible
and that i got to borrow it just like that
the rich can afford to be irresponsible
where is your rifle
my rifle
Well
i
it was on this wall just a few days ago
Answer me
i have sold it
you sold it so you could afford the dress
Right
that is so sweet of you
i am sure you get to borrow a blundertuss when you go on your silly hunts
yes surely
i have to try the necklace with the dress
there you are
i have been looking for you
Why are you out here
i needed some fresh air
i was looking at you
are you having fun
Fun
it is wonderful
everything is so beautiful
they are so elegant and joyful
they are flocking around me
i feel like i am in place here
so you are being courted
you do not mind do you
Why would i
i am proud of you
i am so happy that you are happy
Bjelke danced with me
i saw that
he said that he appreciates you
i do not think he even knows who i am
yes he does
what a house they have
some silly man inside said i am the most beautiful here
i think he was right
you are just saying that
Come let's dance
i am such a bad dancer
i just look foolish
no one sees us
Out here then
we will start here
These stairs
i have been running a lot
i have almost lost my breath
could not you have waited for a cab
i did not want to stand with all the others with this ugly coat
i will buy you a new one as soon as i can
it is so wonderful to see you this happy and beautiful
i will start working extra
i will work through whole nights so we can fulfil some of our dreams
we need beautiful clothes and to surround you with beautiful things
i promise you to toil to make our life less dull
i may have been too content
i did not realize how much these things mean to you
Paul
what is it
it is gone
Gone
the necklace
can not you see
Jeanette's necklace is gone
Did you have it when we left
yes i am certain
i must have lost in on my way home through town
Good God
what are we going to do
where are you going
i am going outside to look
i will retrace our steps all the way
no
Well
Did you go to the police
yes
they hadn't found anything
what are we going to do
what are we going to do
we will have to advertise for it
Go to the police every day
but i have to return it to Jeanette
Just write her and tell her the clasp on it broke and that you have sent it to be repaired just to buy us some time
what did she say
how did it go
Did she notice anything
she did not even look at it
Thank goodness
they are not that different
they are almost identical
Maybe so
you did not tell me how much you paid for it
Twelve thousand
Twelve thousand
yes twelve thousand
i went to many jewellers and looked at many necklaces
this was the only one that looked the same
but where did you get the money
Switchmen money lenders usurers
how are you going to manage
what will we live on
we can not stay here
the rent will be too much
i am going to look for another place tomorrow
i will work as much as i possibly can
we have to fire the maid
we will have to do without her
yes
we will remember this as the luxury we once could afford
i promise to help you as much as i can
we will have to help each other
i keep falling asleep
it is late
Why do not you go to bed
i have to finish this
i have to pay a large amount soon
i know
Interests and instalment payments
we will have to pay them for the next five years
i do not see an end to it
is there much left to be paid
what is wrong
nothing
Tired
i have cleaned two homes today
the wives just tell me off
they are never happy
i say nothing
i do not know what tires me the most the hard work or the humiliation
Get some sleep then
it is not paying off either
we have nothing to spend
everything is so damned expensive
the housekeeping costs a lot
i do my best
i haggle for the cheapest items
i haven't bought myself any clothes in all these years
me neither
i mend cook clean so what
many people do
are you too good for it
i did not say that
but that is what you think
you belong with Bjelke's kind right
do you always have to remind me it is my fault
i did not say that
but you make me feel it
i can not afford to pay attention to your feelings
many people are in your place without making a fuss about it
we are going to pay for it
Pay
Pay
Pay
Mind your own business
Plates cost money
i know it is tough
i really wish i could have given you something better
it is my own fault
it is my own fault
you can not control your dreams
Matilde
yes
Stop that for a second
what is it
you won't believe it
Tell me then
it is over
over
everything is paid for
i made the last payment today
after ten years everything is paid for
is it really true
i am too tired to even be happy
there is a rabbit's nest
can you see it
there lives a squirrel do not you think
Stop
Matilde
Matilde
Wait up
do not you recognize me
Sure i do Jeanette
but Matilde
i know i have changed a lot
no you haven't
but why haven't you come over in all these years
has something happened
Happened
Perhaps
it has something to do with you anyway
with me
do you remember that spring night ten years ago
you mean when you borrowed the necklace
i lost it
Lost
but you returned it
we bought a similar one
we had to pay for it over these last ten years
you see we are not that well off
Did you buy another one
it is been paid for now
Good God Matilde
and to think you did not notice
but Matilde
my necklace did not have real diamonds
what are you saying
it was worth fifty at most
it was fake
Fake
you are joking
my dear Matilde
Tell me you are joking
who was that mom
in the Swedish copyright law that was instituted in 1964 a legal right is given the originator to comment upon and explain his works
it is a fortunate alternation of the law as unfortunately the images do not speak for themselves
then you need to know what the artist really had in mind what his meanings and intentions were
in this short time i won't be able to explain in detail but one thing is certain when it comes to this film
i want to elucidate in a clear and lucid way the problems that arise when a Swedish man unintelligible something wrong with the rip
explanations alternatives in a tangle of problems that is almost impossible to untangle
i want to emphasize almost because one can make one's way through it
and in that fact lies the stimulation
Welcome then to Farsta
Hey
it is time
no
Margareta
it is so unfair
what is
that i have to go to work before you do
at least you do not have to get there the way i have to
could i have the pillow
Sure
that is no consolation
you have made a lot of orange juice
it is almost a quarter of an orange
it is sour too
about potato growth techniques
we should start with brewed coffee in the morning instead
this is tedious
Tedious how
it smells bad
and it doesn't help me wake up
it is all your late night TV
you have screwed it on too tight again
it was not me
it was the manufacturer
Why do you need orange jam
i made you orange juice
i can not pour that on my bread
you could
you could drink it first and then eat the bread
they mix in the stomach
the stomach has was it has as my mother always said
Milk based and cream based ice cream contain as much egg white while cream based contains
do not you look delighted
Why
no i
Sweden lost to Canada
the Northern Lights was the only upside
Canada
was that good
you have to hurry up
you do not have time
my toast
we have bought one package of cream based ice cream
and one average sized banana per person
the entire dinner contains 900 calories
it is a sufficient amount for boys and girls from 9 to 18
oh look at the time
Take the tray
i look so bloated
and by excluding the dessert banana
this meal contains 2 3 of the recommended daily intake of egg white
Even more for women
Honey
could you please do the shopping today
we are going to the Perssons tonight so i do not have time
if we are going there i do not need to shop
yes for breakfast
what do you need
Soured milk
i do not drink soured milk Regular milk then
and a yoghurt eggs and margarine
we need bread too
Buy coarse rye bread then
should i get flowers for them
Flowers
Why
Why not
i thought it was a birthday or something
Birthday
Help me here
we bought Stina flowers last time too
it was not for Stina it was for Folke
no it was not
i can not do this
Put your coat on
it won't show
you really embarassed me last time we were there
Embarassed
yes you behaved like a fool
you wanted Stina to show off her different garments
but that was not embarassing it is just
she is good looking nice and tanned
that is because they go to the Canaries every Christmas
what if you bought us a trip for once
do not start this again
i wonder what you two did in Eskilstuna by the way
what do you mean we
you and Stina
it was a business trip
then why was she there
i do not know
she was watching handball
Folke is in some team
have you noticed my new hairstyle
no
do you like it
Well it is
how much did you pay
such a typical question
but you did not ask Stina that
no but Folke probably did
you have to hurry
Honey
i am sorry for being so irritable
Good bye
Bye

at least otherwise it is not worth it
have you been around the place
it is not very big
Well i will wait downstairs

what do you mean
the guy from the crossroads
he had the card
i was not expecting him
Jean Franois is dead
what are you talking about
he took an overdose
Let me see your papers
Did he tell you about this
i knew he was waiting for a letter
he hoped to earn a lot
i found it and followed the instructions
do you know what it is about
no idea
Maybe the cops sent him
who would agree to do that
Maybe they did not tell him
That'd mean the cops are watching us and will show up
so it is now or never to get out
if the cops show up and we have gone they will think i ratted
I'd rather be arrested
is your man here
yes no problem
we are about to start

what car were they in at the crossroads
a black Peugeot
what did you say to the driver
nothing
he refused to talk
he said his job was to get me there
where did he drop you
Somewhere in the forest
what could you see there
other guys waiting for us
near a car
what did you talk about
i told them Mr Godon was dead
i offered to take his place but they refused
it did not work out
they must've decided i was not suitable
you are lying
you must've convinced them
otherwise you'd be dead now
who says they were going to let me live
i ran away
Once we'd talked i saw one guy pull out his gun and i ran for it
did not they shoot
yes they ran after me shooting at me but i got away
i ran so much i broke my heels
Look
could you identify them
yes of course
could you take me to the place in the forest
i panicked and ran in the dark
how could i remember
you could in a car from the crossroads
no
as i got in the driver put a blindfold on me
you are lying
when i look at you
i smell the stink of blood
i have told you everything
you have told me nothing
i had a plan
if you'd got out at the right station
I'd have arrested the henchmen and made them talk
now i have lost my only lead
what is this all about
it is a dirty business
a dirty business of murder
there was another car in the forest
i remember the number
Tell me
GR 1313
what make of car was it
a blue Peugeot 607
but that is all i know believe me
10 euros please
Thanks
Bye
Subtitles
J Miller
Processed by L V T Parisi have to admit i thought it was a little bit strange that you insisted i cook dinner for us at my place
that seems like a third or fourth date kind of thing
yeah well like i said on the phone all the MSG and sodium in all the restaurants these days
nothing like a home cooked wholesome meal
it is true
i thought it was also a little weird that you even wanted to date me
what is changed
you did not seem that into me at your place the other night
what happened
Really
my God
no
no
no
i came over here tonight to get to know you and hear all about your charity
so how are things in the stressful world of non profits
Donor issues
Fund raising woes
Lawsuits perhaps
Well that is kind of a funny question
Well it is just that i have a friend who works in non profit and he tells me all the time how hard it is raising money and flaky donors bowing out all the time
it is tough
it is very stressful sometimes too
but i really love the kids
they need us
it is nothing glamourous like writing true crime books or anything like that but i really love what i do
yeah
Kids are special
i get it
oh hey
Your pasta's boiling over
yeah right over there
all right
Almost ready
what are you doing
i was looking for a pen
a pen
yes
a pen
because i am going to write you a check for your charity
i am a giver
and i do not have my checkbook on me but i could certainly give you a five
what are you doing going through my stuff
okay
yes
i am going through your stuff
because i believe that you had something to do with Elliot Butler's murder
what
yeah
that is right
i know for a fact that you two had a big fight the week before he died
something about a lawsuit
oh my God
i can not believe this
yes
yes i was planning to sue Elliot
he screwed me over
Big time
Big time
he committed over a hundred grand to the charity
we based our budgets and our programs on that money and then when it came time to pay up he pulled out
he screwed me and he screwed the kids
so you shot him
Wow
that is the only reason you came here is not it
my God
i am an idiot
i am an idiot
you do not want to date me
you want to indict me
you have to admit it is a little suspicious
you have a motive
you were at the party
i left the party
i could not get in to see Elliot because that English queen would not let me get anywhere near him
and then you blew me off
Thank you very much
and then i left right after i met you
i went and filled my car up with a tank of gas down at the bottom of the hill and then i drove straight home
so you left the party early
yes
the guy you should be investigating is Elliot's ex boyfriend
they had a nasty break up
Elliot said he drained him of all his money and that was another reason he would not donate to my charity
so what is the boyfriend's name
i do not remember
he is like a casting guy
some muscle dude
Ivan
Ivan so and so
yes
Russian
Like a Russian name
oh Jeremy i am so sorry
i feel horrible
Boy you really take this whole true crime mystery thing seriously do not you
you are a real Jessica Fletcher
oh my God
i loved that show
it was my favorite as a kid
we are so from the same generation
Listen can i borrow your bathroom
yeah
it is right through the door
Wood i need you to call Detective Winters and have him check to see if Jeremy used his credit card on the day of the murder at the Arco Station on the corner of Beachwood and Franklin
i do not give a rat's ass that you are watching Spongebob just do it
Wow
you never let up do you
what is that
it is a credit card receipt for gas
i write them off through work
Take a look at the date and the time
i do not need to look at the date and the time Jeremy
i trust you
Look i am just being thorough
Jessica Fletcher would be thorough
i get it Detective Hatch
Actually i think it is kind of cute
a little bit sexy too
Just a little
a little bit
Well i guess now that you got what you came here for you are probably not interested in a dinner date are you
are you kidding
that Chicken Artichoke Pasta smells delicious
and there is one thing you need to know about me
i never ever leave a half empty bottle of wineWell you see i am a madman
so i am not responsible
i can say whatever i wish
you are not mad you know
you are a fool
what am i gonna do
nothing
Give me something
my God man
i am 47 years old
if i live to be 60 I'd have to live through another 13 years
how can i do that
how can i stand that
do not you see
l i have nothing to do with those years
you see
nothing
l
i mean if i could just live what is left in a different way
Just wake up on a quiet morning and feel that this this is a new day
Forget the past
Gone
Blown away
Begin a new life
Ah l i can not do this anymore
you wanna take a break Paul
yeah
yeah
okay
Let's take a break
what is going on Paul
l i have this throb in my stomach
i have a pain in my chest like somebody put my heart in a vice and just tightened it
you are taking it way too seriously
it is not a tragedy
what happened to your sense of humor for Chrissake
Hey Paul it is Max
Listen
um did you give Autumn a look
uh Jane says that they can not wait past Friday
they gotta know
it conflicts with Vanya but they will go pay or play right away in uh you know at your rate

Fourth floor
Fourth floor
uh sign here please
Tie the legs with string and rub the breast with butter
do you feel lonely
are you living in the past
do you lose your temper easily
hi Nina
this is forJanuary
do you have some aspirin
yeah
i will let him know you are here
Thank you
Dr Flintstein Nina's here
Mr Giamatti
hello
the Soul Storage
yes we do have discounts for couples
so how did you hear about us
uh Well my agent mentioned something about it
and uh uh i read the article in the New Yorker
i was not quite sure about the services provided
People come here and
Well they all want to know if the soul is immortal and how it functions
and we haven't a clue
no clue
we only offer the possibility to de soul the body or disembody the soul
you can see it either way
you can also take a look on the inside before we store it
Look on the inside um um oh
no
i do not
i do not want to look on the inside
it is entirely up to you
now your soul will be stored here or if you'd rather avoid sales tax it can be shipped to our New Jersey warehouse
uh no
God no
i do not want my soul shipped to New Jersey
no
i understand
what exactly is bothering you
Well uh
i uh i have been working on a Chekhov play Uncle Vanya
i have seen that play
oh
it is so it is so Russian
what do you mean Russian
Well you know
the characters are so unlikable
Especially Vanya
he is so full of of self pity
Just my take on it and i am certainly not a specialist
Nut
what
no
no
i am i am good thank you
Ah
shall we get back to our problem
yeah
l uh you know i guess i am not really sure how to put it
um l i guess that i have reached a point where i feel like i can no longer separate myself uh from the character
uh
i feel stuck
and uh i do not know what to do
i am not even sure there is a solution to it frankly
yes
Well that is a that is
it is it is an elephant
yes it is
yes
now have you ever visited the circus and seen one if these creatures standing quietly while tied to a small wooden stick
uh huh
you see when the elephant is young and relatively weak it is tied to an immovable stick
so later no matter how large and strong he becomes he continues to believe that he cannot free himself
all right
Right
many intelligent people are like circus elephants
they never question their self imposed limitations
and the soul can become just such a stick
they need to break the chains
okay
i understand all of that Dr Flintstein
um but i think that my situation is a little more complex
Well when you have a tumor you get rid of it
a twisted soul is like a tumor
it is better to get rid of it
i do not think that my soul is twisted Doctor
uh Twisted
it is l i just want to be able to do the play
that is exactly what we are offering you
no
no
no
i am sor i am sorry
this is this is this is insane
uh
what about my what about my family
what about my wife
this is not about your family is it
this is about you
Happiness is not about making the people around you believe that you are happy
i do not need to be happy
i just do not want to suffer
do you honestly believe that it is enough to just live and not suffer
everyone wants to be happy
and i am sure you are no exception
you noticing the colors
yeah
yeah
Surprising is not it
we imagine the soul in bright colors but they mostly come in dark tones blacks browns grays
Lots of grays actually
Mmm
some of these are celebrities
oh
whose soul is that
Well the identity is confidential of course but i believe this one had a melanoma
Jesus Christ
how did we get to this point
Progress
Triumph of the mind
Believe me when you get rid of the soul everything makes so much more sense
everything becomes well functional and purposeful
all right
all right
Ah thank you
oh no
no no no
no thank you
no Stephanie
He'd prefer not to take a look on the inside
Just a plain extraction
how we feeling
oh fine
Good
now just relax
okay
Breathe normally
Your consciousness will not be affected
you will keep everything useful to the proper functioning of your mind
okay
all right
here we go
how does it feel
Awesome
Itjust is
can you describe the difference
Honestly i do not feel much difference
and i have so much energy
how long do you intend to remain soulless
as long as possible
as you can see soul extraction is 100 safe effective and discreet
Experience the prime of your life again
how do you feel
uh i can not tell
have you seen it
no not yet
are not you curious
this is so exciting for us
you know our souls will be stored together
Mr Giamatti
oh eh you can safely leave it here for the moment
this is our soul stimulator
we are going to check to see how much of your soul has been successfully extracted
it is very simple
if you feel something press the red button
if not press the blue
Good luck
um
are you saying that my dog is soulless
no ma'am
it is just that we do not know how to deal with pets
we have got at least 95 of it
what do you mean 95
Well uh the five percent residual won't bother you
it is just enough to keep you animated
Ah
so how are you feeling
Hollow
Good
Good
Good
Th that that is normal
what else
uh
Well maybe lighter
yes light
Light
Light
yeah light and uh empty
and uh bored maybe
um but overall
i feel great
i feel great
Well that is perfect
those are the usual symptoms
so i need you to sign the storage contract so we can proceed
Well let's have a look at it
shall we
Let's uh see what we have got
what
oh um
what
oh please
Mr Giamatti do not worry
Just think of it as um Well as another one of your organs
Like your heart or your liver or your pancreas
okay
okay
yeah
okay
Good
uh you know what
i will tell you what
Why do not i turn around and then you tell me when i can take a look
there is nothing to worry about
i just
as you wish
how very interesting
oh
uh yes
you can turn around
uh
oh my goodness
Look at it
but it is empty for Chrissake
no no
Come closer
you will see
Hey there it is
oh there he is
oh my goodness
how can such a tiny thing feel so heavy
never ceases to amaze me
is this a joke
N N no
of course not
Wh Why
uh
Just because it is small doesn't mean anything
no are you are you telling me that my soul is a chickpea
Mr Giamatti please
Listen
we do not know the forces that shape our souls
a and you chose not to look inside
Internal conflicts even neuroses
oh
now you are calling me neurotic
is that
do not move
Just no rushed movements
we do not want to step on it
there
there
do not touch it
Eh
do not touch it
Careful
Careful please
it is all right
it is all right
do not squeeze
do not squeeze
okay
oh here
here
Thank you
do you think it is damaged
no
no
no
they are extra resilient to all sorts of shocks
Hmm
Hmm
my life is gone
i have talent intelligence boldness
i could have been a Schopenhauer a Dostoyevsky
i am losing it
Mother Mother

and the military
they passed on it
we have to identify new outlets and it takes time Dimitri
i am not arguing
if the US government steps in
we are out of business
i want my soul back
i am sorry that is impossible
you signed the NCNR clause here
it is non cancelable non returnable
no
what if everyone was doing that
we would not be in business would we
hello
oh hi Andrea
yeah hi
uh
Mm hmm
Andrea wants to see us this weekend
Hmm
are you sick
you are very pale
Nah
Just the usual stuff
i am fine
you need to look after yourself
how is Uncle Vanya
can we not talk about that
i see my feet
i see my feet
i have feet
how do i know they are mine
that is a silly question Paul
Feet are tied to your legs
Legs tied to your torso
you control it
Eh
if i have this body
i must be something else
Mmm
is that something new you are working on
what is up
what is going on
you feel strange
Strange
Your skin
what about it
Mmm scaly maybe
Scaly
what do you mean what do you mean scaly
Like a lizard or something
Well maybe it is just dry
what is wrong
Just making me feel like a lizard doesn't really help hon
i just sit there and i talk to her
you know uh she can not hear me
i mean we um we tried the cortex uh stimulation
but nothing you know
oh i just feel so impotent
you know i mean
i just do not know what the right decision is
Your brother should be part of this
you can not carry all this weight on your own
Cynthia
every day i ask myself what should we do
Why do not you just unplug her
what
are you out of your mind
Why would you say that
what did i say
what do you mean what did you say
she was asking for advice
she clearly doesn't know what to do
a and the conversation just goes on and on
uh and i am sitting there and no one says anything and it is gonna go on for hours if nobody says anything
you think it is easier just to hurt her feelings like that
oh come on
i had no intention of hurting anybody's feelings
what was all that celery munching about
what celery munching
what
Why are you so upset about this
what did i do
i can not believe we are fighting about a celery stick
Paul what is going on with you
the rain is ending
oh well everything will be refreshed and breathe
Except for me
no no
no i will be the only one not refreshed by the storm
oh day and night a demon oppresses me and i feel that my life was wasted that i squandered the past on nonsense nonsense
and the present the present Well it is right here
it is absurd
here is my life and my love
what did i do
can i renounce this
no
no
my one true feeling in life and it is fading away like
like a ray of sunshine at the bottom of a mine shaft
uh when i think of your when you talk of your
i am sorry
when you speak of your love for me i do not know what to say
i am sorry
i can not say anything
Mmm
oh God
if only you knew how much i suffer to think that right next to me another life is wasted yours
what are you waitin' for
what damned philosophy is keepin' ya from livin' woman
uh okay
uh that is it
Let's Let's go home
Thank you
yeah
Great work today
huh
Wow she is great
yeah
can we talk
yeah
yeah of course
yeah
so uh you realize that we have a week left
now i think you are taking it uh a little seriously Frank
and relax
we will be fine
we just need to focus on act four
that is all
Paul we are out of time
and i do not understand what the fuck is going on
Well Frank Frank i am just trying to give him another dimension
another dimension
yeah
you know i do not think that he should always be so passive
Hmm
so hopeless
it is just
Why are you looking at me like that Frank
i can not
i can not
i can not do it
i can not
um it is death
it is death inside
Doctor um i am dry as a bone
Nothin' i can not feel a thing
nothing
i can not feel anything
you see
i am
i am about to lose my job
i can not make love to my wife
i wish you'd told me about the side effects Doc
but we do not know
the soul is a mystery
Ohh
everyone reacts differently to the same extent that each soul is unique
Soullessness has its own peculiarities
now however i can offer you an alternative
an alternative
what are you talking about now
we receive a substantial number of souls from anonymous donors
from writers musicians all right poets
dancers painters
Mm hmm
we also import souls from Russia in case you are interested in a Russian soul
you import souls
yes
Well at the moment
the industry is not quite regulated yet
last time i was here uh Doctor
i believe that i said that this was completely insane
yes you did
now but may i ask you one question
have you had one dark thought in the last week
no
have you been able to perform Vanya without feeling distressed
yes
so it works to a certain extent
Doctor
one step at a time
this is not an exact science
but i will guarantee you one thing
the moment you get your soul back you will feel the unbearable weight again and you will not be able to perform at all
okay
okay
what should i do
Pick a soul
Chicago sportswriter
Brooklyn novelist
Hollywood screenwriter
Brazilian songwriter
Russian poet
Russian poet
Mm hmm
Mm hmm
over here
how much longer do you intend to do this
this process is very hard on a system
Hmm your residue quota is pretty high
you should be attentive
they add up
what do you mean they add up
the soul fragments condense and accumulate
they do not check this in Russia
you should be careful
Ah this is interesting
Number 738
738
Russian poet
that is a great choice
how long
oh uh two weeks
two weeks
i will inform Dr Flintstein
we will proceed with the transplant
how would you like to pay
Credit card
That'd be great
um i have one question
uh is it male or female
i can not answer that question
oh God
no i will not shut up
Wait
i am not done
i haven't lived
i haven't lived thanks to you
i have destroyed the best years of my life
you are my worst enemy
i can not take it
i can not
you are nobody
if this is your house keep it
i do not give a damn about it
my life is gone
i have talent intelligence boldness
i could have been a Schopenhauer
a Dostoyevsky
Ah
i am i am confused l
i do not know what i am saying
i am losing it
Mother
i am desperate Mother
i am sorry
can you stop here
this B train is making all local stops to Brighton Beach
B train making all local stops
that is right
Nina what did you write here
that is the scientist
he did not believe he had a soul
next
Sasha how many poets' souls do we have
Fourteen
not enough
all right
so the scientist is a poet and this one also the jellybean
Boss
20 000 Rubles
have you seen it
Seen what
it looks like a prune
Get out
next
we are selling Russian souls to Americans
what about selling
American souls to Russians
who wants to buy an American soul
Well Oleg
Sveta to begin with
do not you honey
she says to have an American soul will help her acting
she made a list
oh
Kevin Spacey George Clooney
Robert Redford Al Pacino
Baby
no actresses
Why do not you pick some actresses too
you guys add some females in there
how do you expect us to do that
you will find a way Oleg
oh hi Nina
hi
the first few days were fine
but shaking cramps headaches uh
Well your system is rejecting it
Take these pills
you will feel much better
no
this is too intense for me
this soul needs a much larger life than mine
no
i just want my soul back
i see
uh well i am sorry it did not work out for you but
is it possible to contact the donor
i am afraid not
Why not
because it is an anonymous donor
she had a beautiful soul
she should not have done it
i do not think it is wise for you to be asking questions about donors and such
this is a serious business in Russia um soul trafficking
uh
uh
have you seen this
it is a chickpea
it is a pea
Hmm
for God's sake
a chickpea
Hmm
the shape doesn't mean anything
it is a beautiful soul
does Dimitri know about this
Get him
Get him now
i want him to see what he does to me
i do not want you to worry Mr Giamatti
huh
this is a simple mistake
it must have been misplaced
we are going to find it
you should not judge by appearances
Al Pacino won three Oscars
but it is a chickpea
this has never happened before
we probably shipped it to our NewJersey warehouse
oh God
oh G
you do realize that uh this is the end of my career
uh but i do not want you to brood over it
we are starting to believe that it may be possible to develop a soul from almost nothing
like uh a muscle
uh
and who knows
after long work and dedication in the long run
what oh oh what long run
in the long run we are all dead
all i am saying is that it is possible to develop from the five percent of your remaining soul a fully developed one
Heracleitus put it quite eloquently
he said the soul is its own source of unfolding
i do not give a shit about Heracleitus
i want my soul
i just want my soul the way it was with all its imperfections and darkness and
we are going to find it Paul
do not you worry
do you have any American films with Paul Giamatti
who
Paul Giamatti
Paul Giamatti
you are extremely sexy
you know unbelievably sexy
it is so nice to be here with you
Let's go somewhere and make love
Paul
is there someone else
no
for Chrissake no
there is not anyone else
Well i am sorry but things have been pretty strange round here recently
you smell different
you feel different
what am i supposed to do
Just watch you come in at dawn
Honey uh
Honey
if i were a different me in the same body
would you still love me
what are you talking about
i have uh extracted and stored my soul
but now uh they have misplaced it
they do not know where the hell it is
it is a total nightmare
it is a total nightmare
it is a total
i can not
it is it is the end of my career
and uh and it is it is the end of us
Why would you do that
Eh uh l i do not
i just told you
i do not know
i do not know
i am uh
i do not know
Max told me that his mother in law did it
and then she told me that uh that Cynthia was thinking about doing it too
Cynthia
yeah
what does it ma yeah Cynthia
i just i got
i got confused
i got confused
it was
it was just for two weeks
oh my God
oh my God
oh my God
so you are completely soulless right now
what
no no no no
not exactly no
i still have five percent of my soul
Five percent
but i rented the soul of a Russian poet
you did what
l i just did a silly thing
i just did a
i just did a silly silly selfish thing
Ah Ah
Aah
i will understand if you despise me
he was not my lover yet
what are you talking about
he was your lover
what are we doing in this restaurant
you are awfully fidgety or something
do you know when she plans to return the soul
i am not paying you to ask questions
no
N yes i understand
but i was asking if
uh nothing yet
uh in the meantime what should we do with the poet's soul
uh do you want to keep it or would you rather be soulless
no no
no soulless
God no
all right
um Take two of these three times a day and you should be fine
it always takes time for a soul to get rooted
but i do not want it to get rooted
i want mine back
do you understand
yes i do understand
i am awfully sorry
i just um if there is anything else i can do for you in the meantime
i would like to get in touch with the donor
i do not know who the overseas donors are
you see the souls are extracted in Russia and then they are transported by the uh by the mules
Mules
yes
Russian women
Souls are extremely volatile at altitude
Well can you tell me who the mule was
what is goin' on here
you know where it is
Right
you know where it is
Jesus Christ please
Just tell me where the hell my soul is
i did not know it was yours
i mean u until i rented your films
Mm hmm
i am really sorry
Wait
what are you talking about
Your soul is in Russia
what
in Saint Petersburg
what is my soul doing in Saint Petersburg
Eh you did not
you did not sell it on the black market or anything did you
no
N
it is with my boss's wife
she wanted
she wanted to try the soul of an American actor
an American actor
Why the Why the hell me
could not find anyone else
she wanted to try the soul of famous American actor
there is a list
she wanted the soul of
Sean Penn
oh
Johnny Depp
Robert De Niro yeah
how do you call this when you you take something but but you want
to steal
but you want to give it back
Borrow
we just borrowed it
you borrowed it
we just borrowed it
you just borrowed it
Well uh you borrowed it
Please
who says that you can just go around borrowing people's souls
Please Please
for God's sake
i am sorry
what can i do
i mean can i buy it back
it is not about the money
they are very wealthy
the only thing they do not have is talent
some Russian actress who is the wife of a big shot over there is toying with my soul
that is all that i know
you sure you do not want to take the lawyers or
or Steve or Max
no
no lawyers no managers no agents no publicists

Imagine for a second that your wife carries in her body the soul of another man and refuses to be separated from it
uh no
i uh i can not imagine that
no
it is a form of adultery
oh for God's sake
um no actually
Adultery implies consent between both parties
oh
and nobody ever asked me anything
yeah
yes yes
yes but but the whole thing is rather humiliating you see
that has nothing to do with me
Look
does your wife know what is going on here
we thought we were getting Al Pacino's soul
Al Paci yeah yeah

this is not about you
it is between my husband and me
Jesus when did my life become so complicated
i like to stay home you know
Just read watch movies nothin' crazy
what do we do now
we wait for a good moment

i do not know
it is just
i could not look

i did not know she had friends in America
Olga two weeks ago committed suicide

Olga committed suicide
what happens to the soul when the donor dies

Hmm
Hmm

her clothing is characterized by fastidiousness hushed sexiness and a certain deluxe abandon
Deluxe abandon

i can not really talk about it
most of the unclaimed souls have been transferred to a hedge fund
oh
Well i am i am glad it is all sorted out
Believe me i have spent some sleepless nights thinking about you
Well uh it is not completely sorted out Doctor
i am here for uh Nina
I'd very much like to help her
Mm hmm
um she is quit the mule thing
oh well that is some good news
she was not gonna last long at that pace
uh c come with me
uh excuse me
this is Paul Giamatti
he is um
he is a very good client of ours
Stephanie i need you
are you interested in an acquisition
uh well no not exactly
i am looking for a soul
Number 532
532 532
here
you are lucky
we have just acquired it
Very good
the donor would like it back
not a problem
we have to assess the value
it is a shadow price
i do not know what that is
there is no market price for it yet
our accounting department has this person was was working here
she was i know our records indicate she was a mule
we are not a charity business
we are a hedge fund
you are speculating in human souls for Chrissake
Mr Giamatti we took large financial risks to set up this operation
without us this soul would probably be somewhere on the Eastern European or Asian underground market
to be honest with you i am not even sure she has room for it
her residues quota exceeds the standard threshold
her what
the fragments from all the souls she carried they accumulateSuspenseful music
Whimpers
Monster growls
Whimpers
Guttural noises
Screaming and whimpering
Breathes heavily
Thud
Whimpers
Breathes heavily
oh my God
oh my God
oh

Call 911
Hurry up call 911
Whispering voices
oh kiss me
hello
yeah i
i was in a car accident and a woman got hit
she is she is hurt really bad
Muffled whimper
she she is lying on the ground
Muffled cries
she is still breathing
Police radio chatter
Thanks man
you got it
the driver of the car is Leroy Kent
Says he is driving home from work drives onto the bridge sees the victim running
she runs right in front of his car
Says it happened so fast could not do anything
Get an i D on the vic
no wallet no purse
looks like she just got out of bed
Well Mr Kent have anything to drink
he is had a couple but he is under the limit
any witnesses
Well driver said there was one other guy
Told him to call 911 but he did not stick around
i got guys out doing a canvass now
Mr Kent
yes
how you feeling
is she dead
yeah
at first i
i thought she might be okay
i mean the guy said she was still breathing
this the guy who told you to call 911
yes i i ran over there as soon as it happened
and he walked up
and where'd he go
i do not know i
i called 911
i looked back he was gone
any idea what he looked like
not really no
i was pretty shook up and i
i was paying attention to her
we are done
you guys want to take a look
yeah
Thank you Mr Kent
Barefoot and ready for bed but still wearing makeup
Maybe she was not alone
we got some glass here
Windshield did not shatter and the headlights are still intact
this did not come from the accident
there is no cuts or abrasions on her feet
the guy said she was running
she could not have run too far
Wonder where she was running to
or what she was running from
Background noise
Cell phone rings
C'est moi je suis ici

OFF DUTY DETECTlVE SHOOTS ATTACKER
Sync and correction by Mlmlte www addic7ed com
Noticed the iris is fully dilated filling the eye completely
Looks like a shark's eye is that normal
Well there is usually dilation after death but i have never seen anything like this before
you get a tox report
Preliminary says she had a few drinks not a lot
Alcohol was 06
Well what about drugs
so far none of the usual suspects
Finding the unusual's going to take a little more time
any sign of sexual assault
no but there was something interesting
no crush on the lungs
what does that mean
she was asphyxiated but it was not a result of the accident
someone suffocated her after she was hit by the car
so we got a homicide
These contusions around her nose and mouth
Looks like somebody pinched off her air
i got a hit on her prints
Victim's name was Faith Collins 33
Busted for a DUI a few months ago
License was suspended
Get an address
about a mile away from where she got hit we knew she did not run very far so it makes sense that she lived close by
Well maybe she was running from home
i think maybe she was running from her husband
Roy Collins
got a record for spousal abuse
Industrial noise
you Roy Collins
what she tell you
she saying i hit her
she did not say anything
Well that is different
she usually complains about everything i do
Well she is not going to be complaining anymore
we found your wife's body last night
what
Your wife's been murdered
oh no
i know this is difficult but we need to know the last time you saw her
La last night
what happened
i
i came home
i was hungry
Faith would not get off the computer
Like always she is got to connect with her 322 friends
i mean who the hell has got 322 friends
i mean i am hungry
i have been working all day
so you argued
yeah
an and she walked out
you know mad
i did not mean anything i said
Did she tell you where she was going
no
you go after her
no
about what time did she leave
i i do not know
Ten or something like that
so she left
you stayed home
that is your story
it is the truth
Anybody see
you talk to anybody
no i
i was waiting for her to come back
she always comes back
you guys think i did something to her
you think i killed my wife
Did you
you want to do yourself a favor
Why do not you come downtown with us
we put you in a lineup what do you say
you want me for a lineup
Arrest me
but you do not got anything on me because i did not do it
where is she
her body's in the morgue
when do i get her
Somebody'll contact you
what do you got
Well according to her credit card
Faith had a couple drinks at a bar called the Blue Moon at around 10 30
Bartender said she talked up a couple locals but she left alone
she did not have her car
her license is suspended
we are checking with cab companies now see who picked her up
Called to the house four times for domestic disturbance
the husband's been arrested twice for abuse
i mean sounds like a battered wife who could not break the cycle
Sure the husband's not covering
could be
he admits to arguing with her
any chance she talked to a family member about her problems last night
no calls on her cell after 9 00
what about her 322 friends
Maybe she reached out to one of them
Hey check it
she posted last night
Looks like a park
or a private garden
what time did she send it
11 37
now if this was taken from her cell phone the GPS coordinates should be embedded in the file right
1516 Longacre Road
Map it
that is right here
Right near the bridge
Definitely running distance
Click location
the Bramble House Bed and Breakfast
you know it
when do i have time for a bed or breakfast
Let's check with the cab companies see if they made any drop offs at a B B you do not have time for
not bad
you should make time for a place like this
Check out the'67 MGB roadster
you ready for a little bit of trivia
Royal blue and chrome bumpers
Collectors call that model right there the most desirable MG ever made
Impressed
Mildly
of course yes i remember her
she came in I'd say it was after 11 o'clock
i was in the kitchen pulling up some biscuits for breakfast and i heard the bell ring so i went and got the door
oh excuse me a minute
i have got your bill right here
Hope everything was to your liking
oh Billy we just love this place
it is so magical
Thank you
Laughs
Thank you
yeah we will see you on our anniversary
i look forward to it
oh and tell your friends
Five stars on yelp
and you two you guys are going to love this place
Newlyweds
they are a third of my business
so i am sorry where were we
the girl
of course right yes
um
i showed her a room and the garden
but she did not stay
no she did not have a bag with her so
i am sorry is there a problem
a cab dropped her off
it did not pick her up
can you explain that
i really do not know
i mean
if they do not want to stay
i can not force them to
you know to tell you the truth she seemed a little bit concerned or troubled
and it is not really my place to get involved in guests' personal lives so
could we see the garden
of course yes
oh but i warn you
you might want to stay
Laughs
oh excuse me
no problem
Hey
yeah this is the place
she came here then what
oh i showed her these Amber roses that bloom only in Portland
and uh my flowering Wisteria
and of course the Agapanthuses
but do not get me started on those
and then she said she wanted to sit for a moment and gather her thoughts
so i said that this
be careful where you step
Squish
Ugh
Sorry i did not mean to do that
the toad is an endangered species
it is the first sign of our extinction when toads die
i am
i am sorry
i did not see it
Well if you can think of anything else
of course yes i will contact you immediately
would you like me to show you out
no we are good
Hey
have a good day
it is all i got Jim
Let me know if you need anything else yeah
can i help you
yes i am looking into the death of a friend of mine
he was shot by one of your detectives
are you a lawyer
no just a friend of the family
here is the newspaper article
i brought it along so you'd know what i was talking about
Take a seat please
he wants to talk to the officer who shot his friend
what did you tell him
i told him we do not give out that information
Sir he is waiting
how do you want me to handle this
Tell him the Detective's not available that someone from the department will get back to him
yes sir
and make sure to get his name number and address
do a background check and get back to me
yep
the cab picked her up from the bar but why did she go to the Bramble House
she was probably just looking for a place to stay so she would not have to go back home
Cab driver could've recommended it
what does it matter she did not stay
Well that is what we need to find out
she went there but she did not stay
and she did not call for another cab
so you are thinking she ran from there to the bridge
i am thinking we have to run a background check on Billy Capra see if any other women have had trouble at his place
Also run a check on unsolved attacks on women or missing women

i have followed and observed a goat like creature
for several days now
i have finally been able to identify him as a Ziegevolk
sometimes known as Bluebeards
i now know he is responsible for defiling several women who seem to have fallen under some sort of spell
i have not yet been able to determine how such an oafish man is so attractive to these poor young women
Melancholy violin music     knock at door
  insistent knocking
Really
Look if i had anybody else
i could talk to about this stuff I'd go there
i feel like i should complain but
i am just not in that mode right now
Come on
you know anything about Ziegevolk
a little
they are mostly like preachers
Game show hosts
you know actor types
you know guys like to be in the public eye
Why did one goat out on you
yeah
do you know some
i knew one in high school
Elvis Greenspan
got all the chicks
Like every hottie in school
okay kid was 5'4
Weighed in at like 280
it is hard to believe but Ziegevolk give off this sort of scent
what you mean like pheromones
yeah they secrete it in their sweat or something
Chicks can not resist it
and if one of these goat guys touches you
look out man they own you
Why do you think those Hollywood types are always hugging everybody right
and would they ever kill
no Bluebeards got a bad rep
they are lovers not fighters you know
they like to have a lot of females hanging off their every word
not exactly the monogamous type you know
they live for the rut
the what
the rut
Picking out the choicest females you know
for breeding
you see them in bars all the time
they are players
one night stand type guys
what are you thinking
oh i am just wondering why certain people are attracted to each other
it is all about chemistry
oh well that explains Dale Armstead
Guy who stole your
Guy your first love
that was not love
Well it certainly was not looks or intelligence
you are one to talk
i met your first girlfriend
okay that was not chemistry
that was stupidity
Well how do you know you are not being stupid by being with me
i do not
i just
i think there is a lot more to it than that
you know in biology like systems tend to integrate
that is so romantic
how about we get the shopping done and go home and integrate
Give me the list and get the car started
Lab results on the glass removed from the gashes on Faith's arm
it was regular window glass
so it must have come from a house or an apartment
Maybe she was trying to break out of a window
Well we know she was running from something
What'd you get on Capra
Well all i got is that he moved into town about a year and a half ago and bought the bed and breakfast
i am having a little trouble on the background before that
i think our boy must have changed his name
but i did get a hell of a hit on missing women here in Portland in the last six months
one came from Los Angeles another from Seattle and a third from Eugene all open cases
are there clusters like this in other cities
i think we better find out
it is the same story with each one of these women
they all came here in the last four months and vanished
any record of these women staying at Capra's place
no but then we figured he would not want any record of them staying there
and we think Faith got away from him
then he hunted her down and killed her
we also found three other clusters of missing women
one in Detroit four years ago
Seven women there
another batch in Des Moines two years ago
Six women there and four women in Tucson in 2000
and here is the really weird thing
all 17 women were eventually found alive 14 of them pregnant
the DNA checked out to be the same father for each one
so we have got ourselves a serial rapist not a serial killer
this guy is definitely a breeder
Well can you connect him to Des Moines Detroit Tucson
we are working on it
we think he changes his identity every time he moves
any of the women able to identify him
no every testimony made it sound like they were kept in isolated conditions using some kind of gas to keep them disoriented
they did not know where they were or who was holding them
if this is the same guy here in Portland we need to be watching him
Well you guys keep watching him
Just make sure he doesn't burn you
we are on it
Bon apptit
Piece of cake
we are good to go
we can track this guy anywhere
Working
we are set
now all we got to do is wait
Wake me when something happens
Wake up
not funny
no he is coming out
what
he is not taking the car
Well he is got to take the damn car
i just got under the car and got a grease spot for nothing
all right i am going to follow him on foot
you stay here take a look around the house
See if you can find that broken window
that will give us our warrant which will give us our DNA

Am i crazy
Maybe i am crazy to take you
are we leaving now
Stop
Police
Billy
Police out of the way
Billy Capra stay where you are
Get down
Get dow
Snarling
oh
Tires screech
he is one sick dude
we will send his DNA to Tucson Des Moines and Detroit and i am betting it is the same guy
Well at least he is off the streets and out of the hotel business
i can not believe any of these women want to be near this guy
you know what
i am betting it is the toads
yeah right toads
if it was only that easy
Maybe i will get me some toads
See how he likes being in a cage for the rest of his life
Sync and correction by Mlmlte www addic7ed comHammond Hall at the turn of the century when the age old mystery of the Hammond monster was at last revealed to all England
that mystery which although by 1900 had become a legend was indeed a real tragedy and constant threat to the lives of all the seemingly doomed members of the House of Hammond
oh Walton
oh i beg your pardon Miss Helga
i did not mean to startle you
oh i must have fallen asleep
it is cold
yes it is a cold night Miss Helga
i will put on another log
do not bother
it is 12 00
i am gonna turn in
my brother come in yet
not yet
he is very late
he and Dr Colbert probably got to puttering about the laboratory and forgot the time
do not worry
he will be along directly
i was thinking those poachers might be up to their tricks on a night like this
Come on Alex
Long past your bedtime
Charlie Clagpool was saying down in the village he owed Mr Oliver one for that thrashing he gave him last week
what does he expect
Oliver caught him setting traps
Come on Alex
Go on now boy
what is the matter with him
sometimes dogs are smarter than folks
oh nonsense
he is just smart enough to prefer sleeping by the fire to the doghouse
Go on to bed now and behave yourself
Hurry up
how big and bright the stars look tonight
Aye and there is frost on the ground too
it was just such a night when Sir Magnus
so that is what is worrying you
do not be silly Walton
i only hope that Mr Oliver doesn't take the shortcut back
that path by the edge of the cliff
Why should not he
when stars are bright on a frosty night beware thy bane on the rocky lane
Surely you do not put any stock in that old legend
it is only 20 years ago since your grandfather was killed
Grandfather killed himself
after he'd seen it
that is ridiculous
there is nothing to that story about a monster
oh i shall never forget that night when i found your grandfather down there on that path by the edge of the cliff after he'd met it so horribly mangled
and that insane look on his face
that is absurd
a supernatural creature going about killing and sending its victims mad
People do not believe in that sort of thing nowadays
i am sorry to worry you Miss Helga but i do wish Mr Oliver were home
all right if it will ease your mind i will ring up and see if he is left yet
would you please get me Southdown 236
hello
hello Helga
Oliver
no he left not more than two minutes ago
yes
he said he was going straight home
that is all right
oh i say Helga how about a ride in the morning
no that is not professional advice
it is purely social
Fine
about 10 00
all right i will see you then
Good night
he just left
that make you feel better
Thank you miss
Good night Walton
Good night miss
it is probably a dog caught in a trap
that is no dog
something is going on down there
Miss Hammond it is the monster killing Mr Oliver most like
Horrible it were like a dog Get ahold of yourself will
Sounds like a lost soul
all right let's find out what it is
you are not going down there
Tell Strudwick to bring the carriage around
yes miss
Strudwick's got two bays harnessed
Very well
we will have the gates opened
Mrs Walton fetch me a coat
do not stand there gaping as if you'd seen a ghost
but Miss Helga no Hammond ever ventures into the rocky lane on a frosty night
you have been doing your best to persuade me my brother's ventured down there
and if he has then i will go with you
Thanks Walton
but you better stay and mind the house
yes miss
Tell Strudwick to bring the horses around to the front
yes miss
and get me Oliver's revolver
yes miss
Miss Helga please do not go out tonight
do not worry Mrs Walton
i am sure there is some rational explanation for all this
if there is anything out there tonight
I'd like to get a crack at it and i am a jolly good shot
i will drive them Strudwick
Get in
but Miss Helga
Come on Alex
Good boy Alex
Maybe you can help
Get in the back
it came from along here somewhere i am sure
Miss Helga won't you please go back
Give me your lantern
yes miss
Let me have the lantern
i will go ahead
Oliver
Ohh
it was only a rabbit
oh
is a bit scary down here
Oliver
Oliver
Oliver
Alex
what is it
Mr Oliver's dog
his spaniel
is he dead
Horribly
his whole body is twisted and his hind legs have been
Miss Helga now won't you go back
not until i find my brother
Oliver
he is still alive
Thank heaven
Help me get him to the carriage
yes miss
what was that
Well i do not know miss
Dr Colbert's nurse
Kate O'Malley
Well do not stand there like an owl
Go and get some brandy
yes ma'am
hello Helga
How'd i get into bed
i found you in the lane on the cliff and brought you home
in the lane
but how did
i do not re
yes i do remember
i was fighting the
the beast got Kate
is she
she is still unconscious
we have done what we could for her
it must have gone for her after i fought it off
what
what was it Oliver
L i do not know
L
i did not see anything
Well Oliver i am glad to see you awake and talking
that is a good sign
how is Kate
Still in a coma
she may or may not come out of it
but there is a chance
Microscopic
but thanks to your quick actions still a chance
Well you are a pretty good nurse Helga
there is nothing left for me to do but a a little tidying up
Hmm
now tell me what happened exactly
i do not know exactly Jeff
as i was leaving your house i
i saw a glimmer of light on the pathway leading up to the cliff so i went to investigate
i thought perhaps it might be somebody setting traps you know the Clagpools but it was Kate O'Malley
she left a few minutes before i did you remember
i offered to see her to the village and then suddenly i i felt something coming at us from all sides at once
we heard it
Kate screamed and dropped the lantern
then i then it it it closed in on me like like a blast from a furnace
Only it was not hot it it was
it was simply horrible
Kate screamed again and then i was fighting it
Fighting it in in in a darkness that that went all all red
all dark red until a a a splash of fire split it up and put it out
that must have been when i when i pitched on my head
then i woke in in a light and and saw Helga
you poor darling
Helga you are next
you are the only Hammond left besides me
if i die
now what a minute old chap
who said anything about dying
the monster's never satisfied Jeff unless it kills its victim or
now steady Oliver
you must not excite yourself
you needn't talk as though i were a scared kid or a lunatic
i tell you there is something horrible out there
Unless we destroy it it will destroy us
both of us
Please try to put it out of your mind now darling and get some sleep
here drink this
Make you feel better
Poor darling
it must have been a shock for you finding him like that
it was awful
i can not help feeling that i am somehow to blame about Kate at least
She'd been working late and i should have seen her home i suppose
but it is hardly a stone's throw to the village through the shortcut past your place
Jeff there is something beyond all this that that frightens me
what is it
what is this thing that is been hanging over us for years
the village folk will insist that the Hammond monster has returned
but you do not believe in that superstitious rot do you
Usually some basis for this sort of thing
how badly is Oliver hurt
his wounds are deep but not serious
Fortunately he is got excellent recuperative powers
what about his mind
it seems unaffected
most anybody might be liable to forget exactly what happened after a blow like that on the head
Haven't you any idea what sort of a creature made the wounds
Oliver and Kate are badly mauled
but there is no distinctive mark to indicate exactly what attacked them
it could have been a ferocious dog of course
those poachers have a couple of huge vicious hounds
Look here darling why do not you forget about this tonight and try to get some sleep
i will run along
i am sure by tomorrow the police will find out what it was
i have done it Bob
it works
Really
this must be our lucky day
These tests turned out well too
my dear boy all London knows that you solved the Kensington murder with your scientific tests when everything else had failed but nobody's been able to do what i have done
and what complicated formula Christy have you proved
here taste it
oh no thanks
Go on
it won't hurt you
oh hello Inspector
hello
i was about to come up and see you
we collated the final runoff tests on those bullets
they were all fired from the same revolver
Inspector Craig have a piece
what is it
Toffee
a new recipe
do not tell me that you have been using our laboratory equipment to make toffee
do not mind if i do
do not touch it
Mr Curtis you may not think much of female detectives but really
it is simply delicious
the best i have ever made
Your pans
you used that pan
Well why not
if making toffee is not scientific
but that is the pan that i used for the hydrophobia culture and it turned out positive
Hydrophobia Hydro
Ohh
Ohh
that will fix her
here Inspector help yourself
no thank you
she will have her stomach pumped
it serves her right
she is a good detective but she gets restless unless something's happening that makes her blood run cold
you know her prime passion is dabbling in the occult
Maybe the Hammond case would interest her
what is up Inspector
nothing tangible yet but I'd appreciate it if you'd look into it
you might solve something there with these gadgets of yours that is baffled us for a long time
if those are orders Inspector i am ready
Christy and i could do with a weekend in the country
i think it will take longer than a weekend
and it might turn out to be rather dangerous
Well if you are thinking about Christy do not worry
she thrives on goose pimples
do not laugh at me Bob but i sometimes think that there are some things that can not be explained in the ordinary way
and i want to warn you
you had best be prepared to cope with something
perhaps supernatural oh but Inspector Craig
i know what you are going to say
there is no such thing
that from the viewpoint of science all phenomena have a material basis
i have never yet met a case of ghostly interference that would not stand investigation
that is why you are the man for the job
Miss Hammond is waiting in your office sir
Coming
here read the report of the case and then come up
i want you and Christy to look the Hammond girl over
Right
and that is all there was to it Inspector
yes
yes of course
you must forgive me for asking you up to London
Naturally
but there is nothing more i can add that you do not already know
you are sure there is nothing else you want to tell me
Ah may i present Mr Robert Curtis chief of our laboratory staff and his assistant Miss Cornelia Christopher
this is Miss Hammond
how do you do
you do not look like the sort of girl who'd be mixed up in any trouble like this
he said precisely the same thing to Miss Coulter the Sashway murderess
before he sent her to the gallows
Christy
i am sorry my dear
i did not mean to shock you
that is just my clumsy way of assuring you that we will find the murderer
but there is been no murder
no murder
then what am i doing here
my dear Miss Christopher
the Hammond case has been in our files for a long time
i knew your grandfather well
he was a brave and gallant soldier
i hardly remember him
i was only a child when he yes
yes
i know my dear
it is always been hard for me to believe that such a fine man could kill himself
Unless he had a very good reason
Miss Hammond Scotland Yard has no desire to pry into people's private lives but we'd hope that you'd tell us about the well the monster
a monster
now we are getting somewhere
there is no such thing
but there is a legend
yes
to the effect that centuries ago one of your ancestors sold his soul to the devil and still lives in a secret room in Hammond Hall issuing forth at intervals to make the sacrifice of a human life in order to prolong his own
i did not think you knew the story
i am sorry Miss Hammond to have to bring a matter which i know must be painful to you out into the open
but we have done nothing to merit having our name dragged through a newspaper scandal
we will keep the investigation strictly undercover
then there is to be an investigation
i am afraid there is nothing we can do about it
that is official
Very well then i will help you all i can
oh that is odd
we were thinking we were going to help you
Thank you but i am sure i can take care of myself
when should we expect you
oh but we are moving in with you
and i warn you i have got an appetite like a horse
what a divinely gloomy old house
Just the sort of place a reliable ghost would haunt
it is one of the oldest inhabited houses in England
we are coming to the shortcut
shall we stop
Right
I'd like to have a preliminary look around
Whoa
Want to come along Christy
no if you do not mind
it is much too early in the day to tax my poor brain
be a dear and run me up to the hall will you
Delighted
do you think it is wise Helga to go down there
after last night i mean
oh do not worry
when Bobby gets on the trail of a ghost its haunting days are practically over
Toodle oo
See you at lunch if not before
Golly i am famished
i do hope that bloodthirsty spook hasn't raided the pantry
Oliver
hello Helga
i say old girl do not look so startled
i am all right
i woke before the scheduled time and even Jeff had to admit there was no necessity for my staying in bed
oh i am sorry
this is my brother Oliver
Mr Curtis from Scotland Yard
Glad to see you Mr Curtis
oh it is a bit late to do anything for poor Kate
she is no she is alive but still in a coma
Even if we find the answer to this it won't help her much i am afraid
i see the local police are already on the job
yes
they just got here
not even the constable would venture out in these parts until broad daylight
i tell you it was those Clagpools
no no Warren
we can not jump to conclusions
we haven't found any tracks neither of them nor their dogs
Constable this is Mr Curtis
oh Mr Curtis
i have been expecting you sir
Well i got your wire sir
and nothing's been disturbed
Interesting case you have here Constable
i would not exactly say that interesting is the word sir
what about those poachers Constable
it could have been them of course
we are dealing with something more serious than a couple of poachers
have you examined the spaniel
we have that sir
no teeth marks or other clues as to nature of what attacked him i suppose
no sir
Strange he did not warn you of the approach of your assailant
i know it sounds fantastic but is there a possibility he did not see it
Even a supernatural being would have to take on material form in order to inflict such serious injuries
i think perhaps we can find an explanation for all this without calling in spooks
could you tear a dog that size to pieces Constable
Well perhaps not
two men could between them
or perhaps a large animal
i might say yes but nothing that size has passed through here lately
now anything big enough to do a thing like this would have to leave tracks
not necessarily
how about a big monkey
i suppose you have checked up to find out if one has escaped anywhere
there is no shows in the vicinity sir
there is a zoo about eight miles from here
a monkey
Seems a likely notion
it is a possibility of course
shall i check up on it sir
can not do any harm
Right sir
who is that fellow in the velveteens
that is Warren Kate's fianc
they were to have been married
Poor fellow
he is all broken up
you do not really believe that ape theory
no
but it will give them something to play around with
then they won't have time to worry about me
do you have any theory at all
it is too early to form an opinion yet but we have to figure on something with almost superhuman strength who tears with grasping paws and bites ferociously whose approach even a dog can not sense who comes and goes heaven knows how without leaving any tracks
Find anything
nothing of any importance
Mr Curtis and Miss Christopher will be stopping with us a few days Walton
uh yes sir
oh my dear i do hope you will forgive me but i prevailed upon your butler to serve luncheon in here
so much cozier than that enormous gloomy dining room
i am glad you did
the fire feels good after that fog
Miss Christopher i want you to meet my brother Oliver
how do you do Miss Christopher
Why you poor dear boy
what a ghastly experience that must have been for you last night
oh
oh come and sit by me and tell me all about it
you know i am awfully rude not waiting for you but luncheon comes but once a day and i thought it was a pity to spoil it
i could do with a couple of those pork sausages myself
i always make it a practice never to hunt down ghosts on an empty stomach
you know my dear ghosts do not like nice warm rooms
there doesn't seem any point in tempting that spook of yours to barge in while we are eating
do not tell me you have already decided it is here in the house
Well you can laugh if you want to but there is something here
something strange
Very strange
i can feel it
i should have warned you
Miss Christopher suffers from an overdeveloped supercalaphegalus
a super cala what
Feminine instinct
Good gracious
what was that
Door slamming i imagine
Wind's come up
i thought i heard someone scream
it is probably Millie the new maid
her hair's been standing on end ever since last night
Maybe you better go and see Mrs Walton
yes miss
Millie
what is the matter with you
the monster
it is here in the house
are you out of your mind
i tell you it is here in there
it slammed the door right in my face
be quiet girl
you do not know what you are saying
there is nothing in there
Mr Oliver did not see nothing last night either
i tell you there is something in there
Even if there ain't
Ohh
what was that
i do not know
what was that
Clanking chains
what did i tell you
Seems to be coming from the direction of the crypt
there is a crypt in the house
yes
down in the cellar
Sir Magnus is buried there
Let's have a look around
Splendid
Maybe we will catch the ghost with his shroud down
Brrr
this place is colder than a tax collector's heart
everyone seems to be resting in peace
by daylight at least
who is the crusader
Sir Reginald Hammond
he lived in King Richard's time
was killed in Palestine
is that supposed to be the monster
i told you there is not any monster
if that is a lapdog i am a canary bird
do you make anything of it
it might be meant for anything on four feet
People have always bred the dog into fantastic shapes
but that is no canine tail
and those round paws Hmm
it is rather curious
who is this beautiful specimen of manhood
Sir Oliver
now why would such a handsome man want to kill himself
it is a sort of a junior Westminster Abby is not it
yes Miss Christopher
it is been the family burying place for 500 years
oh Miss Hammond
you admitted that there was a legend in the family
Why not trot it out so we can all have a look at it
i have told you everything i know
Well you did not tell us about all these ancestors of yours who were killed by this so called monster
or who killed themselves after meeting it
Why do you insist on hiding now look here old man
is there by any chance a reason why you do not want this brought out in the open
Certainly not
i am only thinking of Helga
she is had enough to worry her since the other night
and i see no point in upsetting her unnecessarily
it is all right Jeff
i am sorry Miss Hammond
i do not mean to distress you
Exactly what is it you want to know Mr Curtis
what about this chap who sold his soul to the devil and is said to live in a secret room
that is nonsense
there is a secret room but there is nothing in it
how do you know
i have been in it
Lately
i say Curtis this is not a court of law you know
the room's been untouched for centuries
we finally locked it up several years ago
Mind if i have a look at it
not at all
i have the key right here
Come along
Coming Curtis
Right
they are going to the secret room
that Christopher woman suspects something
they won't find anything
we shall see to it that they do not
Shh
would you add another crime to all the others
there are some things it is better not to know about
oh i say Alex
what are you doing here
you rascal
you scared us
Wait a minute
there is someone here
someone besides us
Walton
what are you doing here
i beg your pardon sir
i did not mean to startle you
i was on my way to the cellar to get some wine for dinner
i wish you'd stop sneaking up on people like that
can not you cough or sneeze or do something to let a person know you are about
yes sir
i am sorry sir
it is just an excuse to keep an eye on me
Probably expects me to go out and hang myself at any moment
Oliver
do not worry darling
i am much too fond of this old earth
Creepy sort of a chap that Walton
he may seem odd to you but he is really a very kind fatherly person
has he been with the family long
Ever since i can remember
he seems to have something on his mind
it is here
uh oh
there goes that old supercalaphegalus again
be quiet
do not move
there is something in the air
something out of the ordinary
something very strange
Nonsense
it is no ghost or the dog would have noticed
Your dog did not notice anything last night either did he
that is right
Hmm
that is odd
I'd say that it rather neatly disposes of the supernatural
it does Doctor
I'd say so
Well that seems to settle it
when stars are bright on a frosty night beware thy bane in the rocky lane
Ha
Pretty little ditty
someone ought to set it to music
Sounds like a pretty definite warning to me yet you ignored it last night
to tell you the truth i never took it very seriously
Seems rather like flying in the face of fate
in view of what happened to your ancestors
Superstitious rot
Superstitions are often based on fact
if you want to know more about it there is a family history in the library
Thanks
i will have a look at it
how long did you say it was since anyone has been in this room
Three or four years at least
you are sure
i have the only key
and you haven't been here recently
not since Helga and i came here about three years ago when
when what
we decided to lock up the room for good
Why
for the simple reason we never used it
i see
and you haven't been here since
Frankly Mr Curtis i do not see the necessity for this cross examining
if Helga and Oliver say Somebody's been in this room within the last 24 hours
those are pretty hefty footprints for a ghost
i told you there was not a ghost
Anybody could have made them
Why they could be mine if I'd had a key to get in here
Well let's see if they fit huh
oh i say i am a clumsy ox
Unfortunate Doctor that you had to pick this particular moment in which to lose your balance
the last time i lost mine i had one too many
Well i am terribly sorry old man
Why do not you send this fellow Curtis packing
one doesn't send a Scotland Yard man packing Jeff
you needn't submit to this sort of thing you know this cross examination
we still have laws that protect a person's privacy
you do not like him do you
i am afraid i do not
Look Jeff you deliberately smeared those footprints
Why did you do that
do not you realize they might have been anybody's
mine
Walton's
Oliver's
Why should we let this detective involve innocent people in an investigation that is entirely uncalled for
Mr Curtis is trying to help us and if we can help him
oh Miss Hammond
i will run upstairs
i want to look in on Kate
he is pretty fond of you is not he
Dr Colbert is one of my best friends
that undoubtedly accounts for his aversion to me
do you always analyze everything Mr Curtis
Miss Hammond if your brother were killed last night you'd have become sole heir to the estate would not you
Why i suppose so
Why
then someone who knew this legend of the monster might have used it to get rid of your brother
i do not follow you
with Oliver out of the way your husband if you had one would control the estate
you mean Jeff
that is absurd
Perhaps
but why should a man of his ability bury himself way up here in this little village instead of practicing in London where he belongs
Maybe you better ask him that
oh Doctor
Hmm
i wanted to get that book Mr Hammond mentioned
do you know where it is
Why yes
in this bookcase i believe
Hmm
that is curious
Used to be right here
i have seen it often
Looks like somebody else is interested in the history of the Hammond family eh
i may have been mistaken
i thought it was there
Perhaps you better look around
or perhaps that is just one more thing i am not supposed to know about
i remember now
you practiced in London a couple of years ago
Specialized in nervous diseases
yes that is it
you are a brain specialist
i have had some little success in that line yes
Why did you leave London
now look here
i resent your attitude
my affairs happen to be my own business
and i will thank you to bear that in mind
Sorry Doctor but whether you believe it or not
i am trying to help Miss Hammond and her brother and i have a feeling they will need help
the best way you can help them is to go back to London
Dr Colbert i will make a deal with you
you tell me frankly what you know about all this and i will drop out
i am sorry
i can not do that
have you any objection to telling me where you were last night
i was in my laboratory
i see
i talked with Helga on the telephone not two minutes before
that is true Mr Curtis
are you positive it was only two minutes
Things happened pretty thick and fast about that time you know
you could have miscalculated
Walton was right in the room with me
he will verify it
i expect he would
Dr Colbert
Dr Colbert come quick
it is Miss Kate
the girl's dying
i am afraid so sir
Mr Curtis there is one thing i feel you ought to know
yes
the other night Mr
Oliver and Miss Kate were mauled and scratched as if by some wild beast
that was not everything
Go on
you know that Miss Kate hasn't come out of it but she is not just unconscious
it is as if she was
Well paralyzed or drugged
Dr Colbert tell you this
no
i could tell by the look of her
i know about such things
but if you do not mind sir I'd rather you did not tell anyone
i won't unless i have to Mrs Walton
and thanks
from all i can gather about this wretched spook you are not going to find it under that glass
i am not sure this wretched spook as you call it was responsible for what happened
Neither am i what about that doctor
he smeared up those footprints deliberately did not he
do not tell me you had to rely on your feminine instinct to arrive at that conclusion
Mmm
he knows more about all this than he is telling
that is the trouble
they all do
the girl too
all of them
oh dear
and here i thought you were casting sheep's eyes at a pretty girl
Well that doesn't prevent me from knowing she is hiding something
Whatever can it be
i have got an idea but i need proof
would this interest you
i do not know
Looks like a tuft of hair
the dog's
i do not think so
it is too coarse
but what do you make of this
it looks like a scrap torn from a muffler
that is what i made of it
whose do you suppose
that my pet is for you to find out
do you mean that i have got to steal every woolen scarf in the neighborhood
and without anyone catching you at it
a fine detective you are making me turning me into a thief
Good work Walton
i was not aware that you were being watched
you did a very thorough job Walton
you needn't look so guilty you know
You'd make a very poor accomplice
Accomplice
Come now out with it
what were you burning
Waste paper
we always burn it
in this room
uh uh
that won't do
you went out of your way to burn something that you wanted to get rid of
you chose this room because you thought you would not be seen
yes
it was not waste paper at all was it Walton
no sir
it was something you did not want me to find because you thought it might incriminate you
that is not true sir
it was
i am sorry sir but i can not say
you realize this puts you in a very serious position
Walton
i am sure that you have given long years of service to the Hammonds
i know that you'd do anything in the world to help them
Why won't you let me help them
Mr Curtis leave Hammond Hall
Go back to London before it is too late
Too late
what are you keeping from me
there are some things that are beyond the understanding of us who live on this Earth
you are not safe here
Miss Christopher's in danger too
Won't you go back
i am sorry Walton but we have a job to do here and i mean to see it through
Very good sir
no one can say i did not warn you
Strudwick
do not tell me you are doubling for the monster
i do not know anything about the monster
you surely did not come here to say your prayers
i do not see as it is any of your business
you and Walton happen to be the only two members of the household besides Miss Hammond who were up and about when the attack occurred
Mr Curtis i do not know anything about the monster
i swear i do not
you better tell me what you are up to Strudwick
oh so that is what those ghost chains are all about
it ain't got nothin'to do with the monster
but it does have something to do with your being in the forest last night
is she yes
she is gone
her body will have to remain here till the police complete their investigation
We'd better tell the others
Helga what is it
Kate's dead
i did everything i could for her
she never regained consciousness
we will have to make a report to the constable Helga
there will be an inquest
Poor kid
Why did it have to happen to her
i tried to save her from it
i battled with all my strength
should have put up a better fight
you must not blame yourself Oliver
i have the most awful premonition
i am sure it will strike again
Let me advise the witnesses that they are under oath and it is their duty to give the coroner's jury all facts pertaining to this case
Gentlemen of the jury your verdict as to the cause of the death of the deceased Kate O'Malley is to decide the future course of action in this case by his Majesty's government
Yourjudgment will be guided by the testimony of the witnesses
and i wish to impress upon all witnesses that perjury in connection with an official coroner's inquest is punishable to the full extent of the law
in the event of the jury rendering a verdict of murder any witness withholding vital information or giving false testimony will be regarded as an accessory to the crime
now will you take the stand please
Your name
Charlie Clagpool
the constable's report states that you and your brother Tom were unlawfully setting traps when the fight in which you received a broken arm occurred
we was in the woods all right but we did not kill Kate O'Malley
we was nowhere near her and Mr Hammond
you have not been accused of that
is it true that on several previous occasions you had words with Mr Hammond
that is right
what about it
that will be all
Mr Strudwick take the stand
yes sir
Did you see the Clagpools on the night of the crime
i suppose i did
can not you be sure whether you did or not
yes i am sure
what were you doing in the woods at that time
i was settin' traps
Strudwick
oh that is impossible
i am sorry sir
i needed the money i did
Why did not you tell us
i could not
I'd been gambling
i had to cover me losses somehow
i hid the chains in the chapel
oh dear
there go my lovely ghost chains
as the attending physician then you would say the cause of death was due to precisely what
Concussion of the brain and severe hemorrhage
may i ask the witness a question
of course if the witness has no objection
None at all
Dr Colbert were there any contributing circumstances other than those you just mentioned
i do not know exactly what you mean
the deceased was in a comatose condition all the time prior to her death
yes
she never regained consciousness
could this have been caused by anything else besides a blow on the head
from a medical viewpoint that is possible but hardly probable
my examination i am not questioning the competence of your examination Doctor
i want to know if Kate O'Malley had been drugged
Definitely not
Thank you Doctor
that is all i wanted to know
have you reached a verdict gentlemen
yes sir
it is the opinion of this coroner's jury
that Kate O'Malley died of injuries
sustained during an attack
by a person or persons unknown or by a large savage animal species unknown
there you are Bob
that is the verdict that is always been given in these Hammond cases
what do you think
i think i will be able to prove it is murder
Curtis we can not touch the body
what body
Kate O'Malley's
those villagers are a superstitious lot
they are convinced that there is something supernatural about it and they won't budge
but i have got to get a blood specimen
Kate O'Malley's parents have a legal right to refuse permission for an autopsy
but perhaps Dr Colbert no no not a chance
he ascribed death to normal conditions
Well maybe it was a blind alley anyway
however here is something that will interest you
will you draw those blinds
yes
we traced down a bit of cloth from a missing scarf Oliver Hammond's
i have a hunch that Walton destroyed it
Walton
Why
that is what we are going to find out
what did i do with that cloth
here it is
oh yes
first we take a sample of the thread
then we incinerate it thus
Place it in this tube
Withdraw the air because the nitrogen and oxygen in air interferes with the desired light bands of the spectrum
now we will find out if this came from the same muffler that Walton destroyed
but if Walton destroyed Science doesn't recognize total destruction
you can change the form of matter but you can not actually destroy it
you see those thick groupings of lines at the left end
Mm hmm
that indicates that the wool was dyed with one of the coal tar dyes of the paramino complex
do you mean it is an unusual sort of dye
Precisely
the phenylene dye is unstable and hard to handle
that is why its use is generally avoided
Actually it is toxic
Poisonous
is that why you asked if that girl had been drugged
on the contrary
i am positive this has no relationship with Kate O'Malley's condition
i am only trying to prove that this bit of cloth was torn from Oliver's muffler
this contains a sample of a substance that Walton burned
they are identical
then it was Oliver's muffler that Walton burned
yes
i have seen that look of yours before young man
i am willing to wager that you have about got your man
i am not convinced it is a man
a woman
Animal vegetable or mineral
it could have been a wolf
now listen
there have been no wolves running wild in England since the Middle Ages
that is what stops me but what do you make of this
i found this during my first investigation at the scene of the crime
Obviously the hair of a large animal
a dog perhaps
all right
Get the spectrum slide of wolf's hair out of my case while i mount this
that shows the spectrum analysis of wolf's hair
and here is the one i found
it is incredible
Well Inspector that blows up your spook theory
what is happened
i do not know
it was sealed in this tube and vacuum
it just could not vanish in vacuum
where is the rest of it
that is gone too
it was here a moment ago
it seemed to disappear when the light struck it
Perhaps there are still some things in this world that science hasn't found out about
everyone gone to bed Walton
oh yes sir
some time ago
Mr Curtis come back from London yet
not yet sir
Miss Christopher said he would arrive on the late train
oh
it is another bitter cold night sir
yes
you are not going out sir
Why not
there is frost on the ground
Nonsense Walton
i am only going down to see if the gate's locked
oh but sir Stop worrying Walton
i shan't go near the rocks
i have no wish to precipitate another tragedy
do not move
oh hello Doctor
Come on in
what the devil are you up to
Forgive me old man for breaking in this way
i had to make a blood test
there was not time to run down to my lab at Scotland Yard so i took the liberty of availing myself of yours
i could have shot you
you could have but you would not
you are pretty sure of yourself are not you Curtis
Sure enough of myself to know the blood in this tube contains cobra venom extract
Really
that is interesting
whose blood is it
Kate O'Malley's
what are you driving at
Quite a coincidence that this tube of yours should also contain cobra venom
and what can that prove
one of two things
Either you injected the cobra venom into Kate O'Malley's veins or you deliberately withheld the information that venom was in the system at the coroner's inquest
there was no reason for mentioning it
had no bearing on the case
she did not die from the venom
but you did inject it into her veins
no
it could have gotten there through the scratches of whatever clawed her
Possible
it is not only possible but that is what happened
and you know what the monster is
yes
you have known all along
Well are not you going to tell me
i can not
it is not my secret
Good heavens man
there is been one murder
there is liable to be others
Came from the direction of Hammond Hall
it is here
it is in the house
in Miss Helga's room
where is it
there
Christy
oh Bob
for a moment i thought you were the monster
Quick
i saw it
it is got Helga
what
yes
Mr Curtis sent for us
he slipped past you
you must have missed him
Dr Colbert
Come on
i am afraid you are too late Doctor
God rest his soul
Amen
from a medical point of view it was a rare case
you had hoped to cure him was not that it
I'd been working on the theory that the shock of the cobra venom would eventually straighten out the dreadful kink in his brain
which he had inherited from his ancestors
Precisely
did not he suspect that he was a victim of lycanthropy
no no
in cases like this the patient must never know
he thought he had a nervous affliction
in the Middle Ages they called such men werewolves did not they
now Christy
no no
she is quite right
you could put that in the report
it was a form of mania that caused its victim to imagine consciously or subconsciously that he was a werewolf
that book telling the history of the family had a hint in it
oh so you were the one who stole it
yes
yes I'd hoped to keep you from finding out
that their ancestors were balmy
Well let us say rather that their ancestors handed it down from father to son throughout the ages
it appeared only in the men of the family and only when the victim was out on a frosty night
they guarded the secret very carefully
but the butler knew about it
we know that now
that is why he burned Oliver's scarf
it had been torn to shreds by his dog
he was afraid we'd learn the truth knowing that a faithful dog
never attacks its own master
Hmm
you know Doctor there were times when we were about to put the handcuffs on you
yes
yes i had to take that risk
i will be running along now to see how Helga is
you have all the information you need
Thank you Doctor
my report is complete
Good bye
Good bye
Good bye
Good bye
Quite a fellow
oh my goodness
now what
i just happened to think
i was sleeping in the next room the night that wolf man grabbed his sister
what if he'd grabbed me
do not worry Christy
Wolves will never bother youDr Sam Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator and vanished
he woke to find himself trapped in the past facing mirror images that were not his own and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better
his only guide on this journey is Al an observer from his own time who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear
and so Dr Beckett finds himself leaping from life to life striving to put right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap home'
THUNDER
Hey what is going on here
Nobody punches me and gets away with it nobody
Butch
what are you doing
Dr Masters wanted me to calm him down
so i am gonna calm him down
you are not giving him shock treatment
Shock
you watch me
oh no
you know the rules
Only a doctor's allowed to administer shock
a doctor told me to do it and that is close enough
Just wait a second
i wanna get Dr Masters OK
no Butch please no
no you can not do that
that is too high
you will kill him
MUFFLED oh no
 Butcher and a baker candlestick maker  Butcher baker candlestick maker
you are the butcher

the Butcher's trying to kill him
Go to your spot Tibby
Go right now
it is kinda weird do not you think
Weird
what is happened with Mr Biederman since he got here
he was down at first then suddenly
what happened to Mr Biederman happens to lots of people
yeah
they get committed and then go crazy
Personally i think he'd be better off if he just went home
you get my vote on that one
it is good for Mr Biederman that you are not a doctor yet Freddie
yeah well i hope he is not stuck here till i get to be one
i have been a nurse here for ten years Freddie
i have seen all kinds
Sam Biederman is a classic depressive
he is in here now because he needs our help

Sam you look terrible
Hey how are you feeling

i got Ziggy working overtime on this
Please Sam if you do not calm down

Stormer
Samantha Stormer

oh my what a storm
i am an executive secretary
at a national motor company
in
in Detroit Michigan
you know that silly
it is 1961
and
i am 26 years old
and one day
some day i am gonna join the design programme with Gloria
i am here because i hit Buddy Wright
are not i
that is it is not it
is not it
that is it
my God they pushed you over the line
WHlMPERS
i can not believe this is happening
i really should not be punished
you know that do not you
Buddy Wright deserved a lot more than a punch in the jaw
could i have a cigarette
Please
do not tell Gloria
she doesn't like me smoking in the apartment thank you
they do not let me smoke at work either
oh thank you
Get Dr Wickless up here immediately
Gushie get Dr Beeks on the scene as soon as possible
we got problems big time
how long has he been like this
Well er he was a little disoriented when he first woke up from his therapy
so you see it is all just been a misunderstanding
Sam Sam
you are a scientist named Sam Beckett
Dr Sam Beckett
Beckett
i know a Sam Beckett back in Elk Ridge illinois
Indiana
Indiana
who is Sam Beckett
oh
Just a boy i knew a long time ago
yeah you were a boy and then you grew up and then you built a time machine
was he a friend of yours Sam you called Project Quantum Leap
i do not remember
you do not remember whether he was your friend or not
of course he remembers
when you completed it you tried an experiment that sent you travelling back through time reliving little pieces of other people's lives
Samantha can you hear me
Doctor is he in a trance
i think he is listening to someone
what is he looking at
the guy
the guy in the red jacket
you can see me
Sure
Nice jacket
oh great
i am tuned into little kids tuned into dogs and now i am tuned into the mentally absent
Why not blondes
what is it Tibby
do not you say anything
or they are gonna put you in a hole so deep under this place you will never get out
nothing
never mind
i do not understand what is happening
i think Mr Biederman is splitting into a very rare psychosis known as multiple personality disorder
when the human mind can not deal with something it creates a whole new personality that can
but why
oh great
now they think you are Cybil
we have gotta talk Sam
Samantha
Samantha i want you to tell them that your name is Sam Biederman that you are very tired after your therapy
and Samantha if you do not you will never get out of here
Tell them
Doctor
yeah
i am Sam Biederman
and
i am very tired after my therapy
i was just wondering could i take a nap
but i would like to talk to Samantha
Well yes i know but i am really
i am so very very tired from my therapy
could not i just take a nap doctor
OK Mr Biederman you rest for a while and we will talk later
OK
Thank you
do not tell Gloria
no
OK
he is looking at you like you were a frog in Bio 101
Ha ha
but you did well Sam
you did very well
i do not understand what just happened
i think the voices he is been listening to told him to say he was Biederman so we'd go away
i want an observation room prepared for him immediately
what is it doctor
Mr Biederman's showing signs of multiple personality disorder
Nurse Chatam is preparing an observation room
THUNDER ELECTRONlC SQUEAKS
now what
Well i can not locate Dr Beeks
she is the shrink
i need her
you said you could help me get outta here
i do not really like it here
Sam the only way you are gonna leap outta here is if you can keep Biederman
i mean if we can keep you from getting your brain fried by Dr Frankenstein
THUNDERCLAP
who are you
i am Al
i am your buddy
i gave you your first break
you are the only person who believed in me when i gave up believing in myself
you brought me on this project
Why why could not anyone else see you
THUNDER
Well it is like i told you
i am a hologram
and i am tuned into your brain waves
Look see i can not touch you i can not touch anything
you and everything around you is a hologram to me
how did you do that
because i am not here
i am 43 years in the future
Hey keep your hands outta me will you
God
i gotta check my medication
can anyone else see you
i do not know
Er can any of you guys see me
GlGGLES yeah i can
he can
are you really from the future
yeah
my name is Tibby
Tibby Johnson
i am from right here in Havenwell Pennsylvania
Am i in the future
yeah sure you are
Sam Sam
now he is gone to sleep
what is it like in the future
what is it like
i mean is it
is it real clean
are there cars that float on air
no er
the air is filthy and the cars are still on the ground
but we are working on it Tibby
i like your threads
Gushie where the hell is Beeks
who is Gushie
the programmer
Well never mind
i will find her myself
Listen Tibby when Sam wakes up would you tell him
her her her
him him him
Tell him that i will be right back and not to talk to anyone OK
but please will you tell me about the future
THUNDER a little later OK
Keep an eye on him for me Tibby
Wow
Man oh man i love that future stuff
MAN CHANTS
what if he is developed more than one personality
that is what i hope these tests will show
Yesterday Mr Biederman was a manic depressive
and now he is created a whole new world for himself
Samantha Stormer seems so real to him
a distinct secondary personality with her own life job friends problems eight years in the future
it doesn't follow any cases i have read about
the Cook girl was the only multiple personality disorder i have actually interacted with
hers was a result of childhood trauma
but Sam he is created a whole personality totally unrelated to anything he is ever experienced
and everything takes place in the future
this has never happened before
it is the aspect of time displacement that fascinates me
Perhaps we should perform some of these tests under sodium amytal
Dr Masters Mr Biederman is still a patient here in need of our help
i am a little worried that this type of research may overshadow our interest in him as a person
if i become overzealous i am sure Dr Wickless will let me know
Thank you
hi Al
hi Tibby
oh any word on my future
yeah actually there is
it is not all good but that can be changed
as a matter of fact you are the reason Sam ended up in this asylum in the first place
she was here to get me out
he
yes yes
but now i am gonna do it OK
oh OK OK
how did you get in here
Headache
THUNDER
i used to get real bad headaches when i was little
they used to make me crazy
my folks brought me here to get fixed
they never came back
Too many kids not enough food
i am not mad at them though
i am not
how is your head now
oh i still get'em but i do not tell nobody
no no no
Ziggy says you have got mild Downs Syndrome
Let's see you are outta here in seven years and you end up in the streets
Well if we could find a way to change that
oh Sam i am glad you are awake
Listen i think we have got it figured out
Ziggy says there is a 94 chance that you are here to help Tibby
you are here to help Tibby
you are
you are you are
he can not help if you keep talking like you are missing a few bolts
Help him do what
Well what we have gotta do is make sure that when he gets out of this loony bin he doesn't end up on the streets
you know set him up with a job
Hey Biederman
Get your things together
in a loony bin
we like to call it an institution for the mentally unstable
Sam let me know what is going on inside that noggin of yours will you
Sam
who are you talking to
Right Samantha
Just get your stuff together
Masters wants you moved
Samantha
my name's Tyler
Jesse Tyler
i only sat down at that lunch counter cos i was hungry
i do not belong to no loony bin
oh no Sam
no is right
i do not think you should punish people cos they are hungry
i had money
yes sir
now i know that colour matters to you but it should not
Cos i had i had money
I'd better go get Masters
do not do this Sam
Masters
Sam it took us full power to get me back here this time
all you have to do is save Tibby and then you can leave
LAUGHS
i can not leave
Son i can not hardly walk
i got rheumatism you know
Sam Ziggy says there is an 82 chance that if you keep switching in and out to these people that you have leapt into we could lose contact forever
would you like to play a little game with me Jesse
i am too old to be playing games
besides
i can not read
no you do not have to read
i just want you to look at some pictures and tell me what you think you see
Please
Sit down
it is OK Sam
i got power
i am here
this is Jesse Tyler a second personality
he seems to be a 70 year old negro who feels unjustly persecuted in some sort of civil rights disturbance
he believes he is living in 1955
Hmm
MASTERS
you just tell me what you see
it is a mess
this ain't no picture
he wants you to use your imagination Sam
Sure there is
Look a little closer
Bird chitlins
a whole mess of bird chitlins
LAUGHTER
all right all right
now this one
Try this one
that is blood
what blood Jesse
it is Nell's blood
they ran my granddaughter off the road and i found her
she was bleeding bad
Miss Bailey and me we took her to the hospital
but it was a white hospital and they would not take her
Miss Bailey told'em you had just better
i knew what to do
i think she severed an artery
she will need a transfusion
i knew the proper medical procedure
and i told those doctors
that is because you are a medical doctor
but i thought you said you could not read
Sam Beckett is a doctor
what is it Jesse
Leave him alone
Sam you have got seven degrees
i can not read
yes you can
then you could not know the proper medical procedures
you can
no i can not
no sir
we were share croppers
my folks been slaves
they did not do no reading and writing
who is he talking to
Dr Masters believes it is an hallucination
his name is Al
Dr Wickless this Al is that another one of his personalities
no an external personality would be the aberration of a schizophrenic not someone with MPD
one thing about Willis he tried teaching me you know
but no i am stubborn as a mule and twice as slow
Sam sit back down
if you have to talk to me do not look at me any more
Why not
are you having a problem with your friend
because this nozzle here can not see me and i do not want him to think you are more crazy than he already does
so please just let Dracula here finish drinking your brain
what
i said are you having a problem with your friend
Just sit down finish the test and we can get the hell outta here
no problem
i am gonna sit right down here and finish this test so we can get the hell outta here
i do not know who Dracula is
but i got me a powerful thirst too
what is it take to get a man a glass of water
huh
Round here
Water
we will have water in this room from now on
OK
what do you see
Well this here is the subatomic structure of a quark
what the hell is a quark
i do not know what a quark is Jesse
a quark is a micro particle of a proton or neutron
you have got a degree in quantum physics too
Micro thingy
Please Jesse give it a try
WAR CRlES

Nobody ever tried to teach me nothing
Well i am going to
i will try and teach you to read
but i can not
i can not read
i can not learn my ABCs
i never could
i could learn music
i learned all the words to Pig's Foot Pete and Scrub me Mama with the Boogie Beat the very first time
that is good
could you teach me a song from the future
yeah i could teach you a song from the future but that would not help me teach you
Wait maybe it would
Hey Sam you remember that song we put in Ziggy's memory banks a few years ago
no you would not remember
we were fooling around with a rap song there
if i could just access this and maybe get it to play through the handle HlP HOP BEAT that'd be pretty good huh
that is boogie woogie
no this is rap

Hey you people are gonna have to clean this place up
Stop it
it is rap music
Sam that is right
you remember
you used to hate rap music
the name's Stratton little buddy
Captain Tom Stratton
this is a loud hospital
is Diana in here
oh no not again
what happened to the X2
Did i do it
Sam it doesn't matter what you did
i just saved Tibby
he is gonna learn how to read and get a good job when he gets out
are you feeling all right
Tibby's going to be OK
so you are ready to leap
Look all i wanna know is did i break Mach Three
Come on Sam you gotta leap
we are running out of time
Maybe it was the storm
i sure as heck do not remember
Where'd you go little buddy
Al
THUNDER
Hit him Sam
Hit him
Pop him
Pop pop pop
ECHOES'Sam Sam it is OK you are just dreaming
i am right here Sam'
Stay calm
Ziggy's only got ten minutes of emergency power
i have got Dr Beeks here
and she is got a theory to get you to leap
where is she
she is right here
but you can not see her because she is not tuned into your brain waves
would you like to see her
Er yeah sure
OK
i can see her but
i can not hear her
Well you can not hear her because touching her just brings in the image
it is kinda weird
yeah
this whole leap is weird Sam
the name's not Sam
it is Kit Cody OK
you keep saying Sam i keep looking around for a Sam
OK we do not have time to argue about that now
if you wanna get outta here you gotta trust me
i want out
you got that much right
i definitely want out
everyone here thinks you are Sam Biederman
but i am Kit Cody
no you are not
you said i was Kit Cody
not Samantha Stormer
OK you are Dr Samuel Beckett
you are a quantum physicist and you have been leaping in and out of people's lives
so at one time or another you have been Samantha Stormer Jesse Tyler Herbert Williams
and Kit Cody
and Kit Cody yes
and Kit Cody
when you did what was needed to change the people's lives you leaped out
so i am a good guy
oh yeah you are a damned good guy
yeah
but now you are Sam Biederman
before you had a chance to change his life they gave you electroshock treatment
Hey no more shocks OK
the treatment kicked out your ego and left a valley
it is a valley that is being filled by the memories of all these people you leaped into
i tell you i feel a little punch drunk that is for sure
yeah well that is a good definition of it
what is going on
Sam i am gonna have to let Dr Beeks go
because it is draining too much power
Say goodbye
OK
Bye doc
huh
Sam
yeah
i think you can see that we are in danger of losing contact with you
i do not want that you should lose contact
Well then you have to do exactly what i tell you
OK what do you want i should do
Dr Beeks says the only way you are gonna get your ego back
yeah
is if you take another one of those electroshock treatments
no
yes
no no more shocks
yes Sam
i just said no
no more shocks
no way pal
no more
Forget it
Forget the whole thing
it is the only chance of getting outta here
Sam yes
you have sure been spending a lot of time with Masters
i am a nurse he is a doctor
we both happen to work for this hospital
i just did not want you making any mistakes
what are you talking about
i am talking about Masters finding out what happened to Biederman yesterday
Mr Biederman came in here as a depressive
Six weeks later he is showing signs of violence
now he is split into not one but several personalities
if what you did yesterday has anything to do with it i will tell Dr Masters
you were there too
Weren't you
or did you forget that little bit of information
you lied to me
you told me Dr Masters
you know the rules Nurse Chatam
Too bad you did not stop me
i did try to stop you
but you did not
you could have killed him
WE could have
Ha ha
he told us this morning his name was Jimmy LaMotta
he says he has a real job
Again this personality lives in the future
we can tell from his speech patterns and his physical impediments that the personality of Jimmy is retarded
Thank you
he calls himself a special person
Did you pinpoint yet what first brought on this change in behaviour
Dr Masters suspects that the electroshock therapy yesterday might have triggered some traumatic childhood memories
Mr Biederman's inability to cope with those memories opened a floodgate of people
People in his mind
People he invented to protect himself
Wait a minute
from what
According to his family history nothing traumatic occurred in his childhood or young adult life that would merit anything like this
Unless those traumas never registered in his conscious mind
hello doctor
hello Jimmy
hi
Bye Freddie
Bye Jimmy
hi
hi
when is lunch
Soon
Wanna build a ship
what kind of ship Jimmy
Space ship
WHOOSH OF AL MATERlALlSING it is time Sam
Tell the doctor that you want another therapy session
but i do not
you have to have it or i won't be able to come back
you come back
then tell the doctor you want another shock treatment
is it your friend Al
Al said you'd better give Jimmy shock or he go back to the future forever
Al do not leave Jimmy
Tell him
he is not gonna leave you Jimmy
what is happening
through all the personality changes two things have remained constant an invisible friend named Al and the memory of his last electroshock therapy session
Sam i am running out of time
Ziggy's out of power
he is using all he is got just to keep us connected
Come on come on
Jimmy
Let's sit down and play some games
Tell him
Al says you give Jimmy shock or Al go away
Al won't go away unless you want him to
yes i will
we need to restrain him
SAM
and it is all Dr Master's fault
it is your fault
all doctor's fault
Jimmy
i will be gone forever unless you give it him now
Jimmy
Give Jimmy shock
Come here
Get off him
Give Jimmy shock
Al
Help
Give me help
i can not help you unless you get another shock
Get me a straitjacket
he doesn't need a straitjacket
i will give you a shock you freak
Prepare for electroshock
yes sir
that will be two sessions in 48 hours
you could kill him
Nurse shut up
i said prepare the electric shock room
Let Jimmy go
Let Jimmy go
Get him in there
Come on
no
no
Let Jimmy go
Let Jimmy go
Get him in there
Come on
ECHOES no
no
Al
do not leave me
i won't Sam
do not leave
i won't Sam
Set the voltage
Doctor i really think after his session yesterday
if you can not perform as a professional i do not need you in this room
do i make myself clear
Sam tell him you have gotta have the same voltage as yesterday
Tell him
we are almost there doctor
it hurts
Tell him
you will be fine
Everything'll be fine i promise
Gushie turn the power up
Turn it up to the max
you gotta keep me here
Come on Sam
Tell him buddy
i can not hang on much longer
the same shock as yesterday
the same shock as yesterday
no
yes
it is gotta be the same as yesterday
the same as Butcher did yesterday
what was the voltage Dr Wickless set yesterday
it was not Dr Wickless it was Butch
Butch
yes
you administered electroshock without a doctor present
i do not remember
what was the voltage set
it was set at 200
now
now
Give shock now
he got angry cos Sam hit him so he punished him by turning up the voltage
that is a lie
you had the audacity to take that kind of control
do it
Save Jimmy
i told you to prep them
Save Sam
Please 200
no that is too high
Tell him a doctor now a registered nurse
oh God
i do not care
not without medical procedure
you had the audacity to take that kind of control
all right
Why would she lie Butch
do it
ARGUMENT CONTlNUES
i was doing what you told me
i told you to prep them
without medical staff present
Put your head down
Put your head down Sam
i have never ordered you to administer shocks
THUNDER
do it
Sam
Sam you OK
Al
you OK
you must sleep with me
oh we did it Sam
Sam what the hell am i doing in this uniform
what is going on Sam
i think
Come here
Sam what the hell's happening huh
BOTH
oh boy itfc subtitlesPreviously on Lost
this is your daughter
her name's Clementine
those are fake
i will take the one on the end
Why'd you help me
one girl watching another girl's back
Why are you telling me this
Just do it Freckles
i think we should say he is mine
there is other ways to do this
after everyone we have lost
i can not lose him too
my client insists we handle the exchange of custody quietly
you are going to lose the boy
that is Claire's mother
everything Kate and i have done it was for Aaron
who is Aaron
i am Ben
it is nice to meet you Ben
if i let you out will you take me with you
to your people
that is why i am here
Jin
what are you doing here
hello Jin
are you there
Jin can you hear me
hello
Jin
it is Phil man
where have you been
the Hostile escaped
we are searching the east grid
he is headed north
how the hell do you know that
because he attacked me
what
where are you
Jin are you still there
Jin
Jin
Help
Please help
OK everybody listen up
we do not know yet if another attack is coming
Everybody needs to be ready for your security assignments
Make sure you are in contact with your team leaders
LaFleur's got search parties out but the Hostile's got a good jump on us
we are pretty sure he used this fire as a diversion in order to escape
is he talking about Sayid
if he was locked up how could he start the fire
who are you
Jack
Shephard
i am new
Well Jack the way he started the fire is he had help OK
Somebody torched that van
then that somebody let him out of his cell
since the security cameras did not pick up any Hostiles crossing the perimeter that means it was one of us
Baxter i want a full report on clean up ASAP
you got it Horace
Hey you
yeah you
you are in the motor pool right
yeah
you mind running that winch for me
you have no idea what i am talking about do you
OK
no worries
Throw this lever when i tell you to stop pull it up
all right
Simple
do not do it till i am ready
OK
all right crank her up
so they stuck you in the motor pool when you got here
yeah
Pretty much
Same thing happened to me
Hold it that is good
Right there
they could not sucker anybody into that sub if they told us we were gonna be grease monkeys and janitors
you got to start somewhere right
yeah
what is your name
i am Kate
Welcome aboard Kate
i am Roger
Roger Linus
it is nice to meet you Roger
that is my kid
that is my kid
hi handsome
Did you have a good sleep
yeah that is my boy
hi
oh my God
Hey Cassidy
oh my God
i saw you on the news
i told all my friends i know that woman
hi
this is Aaron
hi Aaron
Say hi
you survived a plane crash
it is amazing
i never thought I'd see you again what are you doing here
Sawyer sent me
Sawyer
so that son of a bitch is still alive
he was when i left
and he asked you to come here and give me an envelope full of money
Well he told me where to find you and said to take care of Clementine
his daughter
she is asleep in her crib right now
Want me to wake her up
i should not have bothered you
i could've sent it
i probably should
Why did you tell me all this
Why do you trust me
because your daughter had a right to know her father cared
Why did not he come back with the rest of you
the helicopter we were on was running out of gas so he jumped so that we could make it to the boat
what a coward
he was trying to do the right thing
he was trying to get away from you
i told him he had a daughter he never so much as lifted a finger to try to call her
i am supposed to think he is a hero because he told you to help us
Hell i will bet this money is not even his is it
they gave us a settlement i did not need
you do not have to explain it Kate
you got the same look on your face i did when he ditched me
all i have for you is sympathy
is it his
what
Your son
is it Sawyer's
no
no i was pregnant before i met him
that is not your baby is it
Kate you just told me you and your friends cooked a story for the whole world about what happened on that island
so you tell me the truth about that
Why are you lying to me about him
because i have to
what happened
what the hell are you doing here
that was Ben
that kid who was shot was Ben
was it Sayid
Did he shoot him
here is what you need to do
Keep your mouth shut and stop asking questions
any attention on yourself is the last thing i need
now scram
i just want to know what is going on
LaFleur
what
what is she doing here
this is
i am Kate
Kate
she is new over at the motor pool
i was seeing if she saw anything suspicious but she did not
you can run along
Thanks
have you checked the Hostile's cell yet
i was busy trying to keep the town from burning
OK then let's do it
he did not break out
Somebody let him out
These are janitor's keys
we have only got three janitors there is Roger Willie and that new guy
i just met him
his name's Jack
i brought him in from the sub
i will talk to him
Miles you wanna come with me
yeah sure boss
i want you to find Jack and Hurley and Kate quick as you can
Put them in a house and sit on them
what for
i do not want them talking to anybody
Things are out of control
all right
i got it
all right go
who did this
do you know who did this to my son
we are working on it
how is he doing
i do not know
Juliet told me to wait out here
Let me see if i can get an update
Thanks Jim
Roger you have your keys with you
yeah
Why what do you need
i must have left them at the house
it is all right
do not worry about it
more gauze
here is some gauze
in here
here you go
if we can not stop the hemorrhaging we are gonna have to pack the tract
OK
where is the doctor
the Looking Glass station till Friday
how is he doing
not well
Hold on
he is still bleeding in there somewhere and i can not fix it
it is all right
no it is not all right
someone needs to get in there find the damage that bullet did and fix it
he needs a real surgeon
you are telling us we are under house arrest
no
you are all free to leave whenever you want
but i will shoot you in the leg
whose idea was this
who do you think
Sawyer's just doing his job Jack
what the hell are you doing Tubby
Checking to see if i am disappearing
what
Back to the Future man
we came back in time to the island and changed stuff
so if little Ben dies he will never grow up to be big Ben whose the one who made us come back here
which means we can not be here
and therefore dude
we do not exist
you are an idiot
Am i
yeah
it doesn't work like that
you can not change anything
Your maniac Iraqi buddy shot Linus
that is what always happened
it is just we never experienced how it all turns out
that was really confusing
yeah well get used to it
but the good news is that Linus did not die so that means the kid can not either
he will be fine
did not look like he was gonna be fine
what if you are wrong
Well if i am wrong then i guess we all stop existing and none of it matters anyway then does it
Doc i need you to come with me
Come with you where
Kid's losing blood we ain't got none to put in him so we need you to show us where he sprung a leak
no
what
no
i am not coming with you
if you do not come with me that kid's gonna die
then he dies
what are you doing
i am making sandwiches
Figured everybody'd be getting hungry by now
he is just a boy Jack
you can t just let him die
you heard Miles
we can not change what is already happened
this has nothing to do with me
Unless you are supposed to save him
Thirty years from now that boy is going to be a man that locks me in a cage because he needs surgery
then you are going to come in and you are going to beg me to operate on him because he is threatening to murder Sawyer
i have already done this once
i have already saved Benjamin Linus
and i did it for you Kate
i do not need to do it again
this is our fault
we brought Sayid back
we caused this
when we were here before i spent all of my time trying to fix things
but did you ever think that maybe the island just wants to fix things itself
that maybe i was just getting in the way
you know i do not like the new you
i liked the old you who wouldn t just sit around and wait for things to happen
you did not like the old me Kate
Hey where are you going
Just try to relax
you are OK
i am sorry
Juliet
one of the new people is here
she heard Ben needed blood says she is a universal donor
this might hurt for a second
Good very brave
so James told me that Jack would not help but he did not say why
if i understood why Jack does what he does i would not be sitting here
off island did something happen with you two
we were engaged
does that count
what is going on
i asked you to wait outside
what is going on with my kid
Kate is giving blood so we can transfuse Ben
Well i am not waiting outside
he can stay with me
then you could check on Ben and Roger here could keep me company make sure i do not pass out
OK
Roger have a seat
Thanks
Sure
he stole my keys
Sorry
LaFleur asked me where my keys were
that bastard doesn't ask any questions he doesn't know the answers to
which means my son stole my keys so he could bust that animal out of jail
Why would he do that
because of me
you got kids
no
i thought i was going to be the greatest father ever
i guess it did not work out that way
what about his mother she still around
no she is dead
she died the day he was born
Sorry
yeah me too
i tried to do what i thought she would want me to
but
i guess a boy just needs his mother
what is going on
he is going into hypoxic shock
what does that mean
he needs oxygen
Roger out of here
what
Get him out
Wait
what
Please Roger just wait outside
Wait a minute
Let me get this straight
all this already happened
yes
so this conversation we are having right now we already had it
yes
then what am i gonna say next
i do not know
then your theory is wrong
for the thousandth time you dingbat the conversation already happened but not for you and me
for you and me it is happening right now
OK answer me this
if all this already happened to me then why do not i remember any of it
because once Ben turned that wheel time is not a straight line for us anymore
our experiences in the past and the future occurred before these experiences right now
Say that again
Shoot me
Please
Please
i can not shoot you because if you die in 1977 you will never come to the island on the freighter 30 years from now
i can die
because i have already come to the island on the freighter
any of us can die because this is our present
you said Ben could not die because he has to become leader of the Others
because this is his past
but when we first captured Ben and Sayid like tortured him then why would not he remember getting shot by that same guy when he was a kid
i hadn't thought of that
how is he
he is stable
is he gonna be OK
he is got fresh blood which is a good thing
Roger go out to the medical station
there is supplies there that we do not have here
OK
Hey
i just want to say
i want to say thanks
i know you are doing everything you can
to save him
all right i am going to go OK
is he any better
he is stable now
but i can not
i can not fix it
what about the sub
can we take him somewhere
no
it is gone won't be back for months
but he can not die right
he is going to die
he is in a medical situation that is not resolvable
we can not sit and do nothing
there is got to be someone who can help him
we have an entire
what
Maybe there is something they can do
they
the Others
you got him
yeah
Ready
one two three go
OK let's go
i am coming with you
no no no
if something goes wrong it doesn't matter for me
you got a life here
besides if Sawyer knew i got you involved he'd kill me
how are you going to manage
i will manage
do not worry
Kate
Sawyer's going to find out Ben's gone and when he does i have to tell him what happened
but i will give you as much of a head start as i can
Good luck
there is someone someone here in Los Angeles
Let me take you to them
who
the same person that is going to show us back to the island
is that what this is about
you knew
no i was
you are pretending to care about Aaron to convince me to go back
i was not pretending
this is insane
you are crazy
Kate
Jack
do not
Mommy i am thirsty
i need some milk
Price check on two
Need a price check on two
you want chocolate milk or regular
Juice box
you do not want milk anymore
Juice box
Excuse me where are your juice boxes
Aisle five

no waiting on checkstand three
Aaron

little three year old blond kid
Aaron
Aaron
Aaron
Aaron
Excuse me i have lost my son

we will make an announcement
no
you have to seal the store
Aaron
Hey
is this your mommy
Honey is this your mommy
i found him in the fruit section
he looked lost
i was getting ready to make an announcement
Thank you
Thank you very much
Sure
it is OK honey
Mommy's got you
Mommy's got you
Tell my
Tell my
Try not to talk OK
Tell my dad i am sorry i stole his keys
i know you got to stop me but i can t just let that kid die
Damn it Freckles i ain't here to stop you
i am here to help you
hi Auntie Kate
hi Clementine
is your mommy home
Sure i will get her
OK
they are going back to the island
Why in God's name would they do that
i do not know
Jack says that we weren't supposed to leave
Well Jack sounds like a piece of work
you look exhausted
Drink this curl up on my bed take a nap
i will watch your fella
i lost him
what
i do not know what happened
we were in the supermarket and i turned around for one second and he was gone
and you know the crazy thing is is that
as scared as i was i was not surprised
all i could think was
it is about time
Why would i feel that way
Why would i expect him to be taken
because you took him Kate
no i
Claire was gone
she left him
i had to take him
he needed me
you needed him
Sawyer broke your heart
how else were you supposed to fix it
Figure out how you were gonna carry him out there by yourself
the line's right over there
Others are on the other side
they ain't right on the other side
we better get moving
Hey
Why are you doing this
Why are you helping me
when i found out Ben was gone and Juliet told me what you were up to
i asked that exact damn question
Why are you helping Ben
and she said no matter what he is gonna grow up to be it is wrong to let a kid die
so that is why i am doing this
i am doing it for her
where is Jack
he is in the shower
is he in trouble
i just need to talk to him
you two mind giving us some privacy
Hey
Ask me more questions about time travel
i needed you
i am sorry
that kid was bleeding out you are a surgeon and i needed you
that kid is Ben
it is not Ben yet
he is just a kid
Juliet i am sorry i can not help you
i am not asking for your help
you made it clear you weren't interested
it is up to Sawyer and Kate now
what
she is trying to save him
and i sent James after her to help because they actually care
i came back here because i care Juliet
i was trying to save you
we did not need saving
we have been fine for three years
you came back here for you
at least do me the courtesy of telling me why
i came back because i was supposed to
Supposed to do what
i do not know yet
Well you'd better figure it out
i can take him for awhile
Sure you can
his father said you think Ben broke Sayid out
a kid will do almost anything if he is pissed off enough at his folks
is that why you asked me to take care of your daughter
Did you
of course i did
Go ahead and take a sip
what is she like
Clementine
yeah
Clementine
oh she is beautiful
Looks just like you when she smiles
she is growing up fast
Already has a little attitude
Bet you and Cassidy had a lot to talk about
she had an interesting theory on why you jumped off the chopper
yeah
what is that
you were worried about what would happen if you did not
you and me would have never worked out Kate
i was not any more fit to be your boyfriend than i am to be that little girl's father
you seem to be doing all right with Juliet
yeah
i have done a lot of growing up in the past three years
Hands up
do not move
i said do not move
this is a violation of the truce
you are over the line
we know
this kid's been shot
that is both of our problem so unless you want to go to war you are gonna take us to Richard Alpert
and you are gonna do it now
Mrs Littleton
i am Kate Austen
i know who you are
Come in
Thank you
Your friend Dr Shephard came here last night going on and on about some person named Aaron
when i asked him who that was he ran out of here like the room was on fire
he is your grandson
and your daughter Claire is alive
what are you talking about
Claire died in the plane crash
no
she survived
when we crashed your daughter was eight months pregnant
she is the one who gave birth on the island not me
we lied
there were other survivors too
we just left them behind
Why
Why would you leave her there
because she disappeared and she left the baby behind
we looked everywhere but
that is when i started taking care of Aaron
when we were rescued we did not
we had to decide what to do with him
i knew she had wanted him to be adopted but i could not
i had to protect him
so i said he was mine
Why did you lie
Why did not you come to me in the first place
because i needed him
i am sorry
you are gonna see that he is so sweet and kind and good
where is he
i checked in two doors down
he is asleep
i know that this is a lot for you to handle
but when you are ready he is waiting for you
i told him you are his grandmother that you will take care of him while i am gone
and that i will be back soon
where are you going
i am going back to find your daughter
Bye bye baby
do not worry
we got them right where we want them
Shut up and keep moving
what is it look like i am doing
hello there James
Where'd you come from
you asked my people to bring you to me
here i am
is that Benjamin Linus
you two know each other
what happened to him
he was shot
and who might you be
she is with me
and why are you here
because we need you to save his life
can you
if i take him he is not ever going to be the same again
what do you mean by that
what i mean is that he will forget this ever happened and that his innocence will be gone
he will always be one of us
do you still want me to take him
yes
Richard
you should not do this without asking Ellie
if Charles finds out
Let him find out
i do not answer to either of them
where are you taking him
Come on
hello Ben

i wish you a joyous birth anniversary
this is the most amazing thing i have ever seen
i have always wanted one
it is it is
it is just the box

Mr President this is more than a watch
it is the Defensinator the most advanced personal defense system in the universe
Try it on
Greetings

Absolutely
Particle weapon

this is nice
Hanging out with old Team Monster
Why do not we do this more often
Well sir we'd like
Anyhoo i am supposed to give a speech at 5 00 so one more blast for the HD cameras could not hurt
Mr President i would not
uh
no
not full strength
oh no
Cool
when did we get a baby on our team
no B O B the rejuvenalizer turned the President into a baby
no
there is got to be a more possible explanation
like it made the President so young he is now baby shaped
which is what i said B O B
that is not what i heard
Anybody else freaked that he is already wearing a diaper
you have to change him back
he is supposed to give a speech on tv
i am not changing it
Mr President
it is Monger
yes i know
Quick someone act like the President
Mr President they want you in makeup
be right there
Just um vetoing some bills and launching some missiles
Give me a minute
do something
if i reverse the polarity it should quickly age the President back into an adult
Great
what are we waiting for
Antigrity activated
oh no
Force field
got him
Monsters what is going on in there
Open this door
one second
Just appointing some ambassadors to East Slimelinia
Escape protocol initiated
Great

Monsters in the name of national security
i order you to open up
oh General Monger we were giving the President a rejuvenating spa facial

Bye bye

Pollo
Laser canon
okay we need to improvise
i believe the word is impro vo mo zize
what have i got to work with
this won't be enough
Perhaps if we get to the cutlery i can fashion a weapon
you can not use weapons against a baby and or the President
he is using weapons against us
Baby President you turn off that thing right now or you are going to get a time out
that is showing him Link
we have to motivate him to shut down the Defensinator
Think
what do babies like
what do baby Presidents like
this one likes destroying things
not sure what that buys us
hi guys
i impro vo mo zized just like Susan said
oh no
all right do not tell gross toes i said this but you got to admire the craftsmanship

Creeps me out
Wait guys

Laughing
Doesn't want anyone to see
okay i think he might be naked
Just saw him wearing clothes B O B

Naked

Time to find out what our alien guest is hiding
Hmm
Locked
B O B
Eye Dr Cockroach
Seriously you got to hold my eye
Won't fit through
Guy kind of loves himself huh
Hey gorgeous
what exactly are we looking for
Plots schemes perhaps some anti earth propaganda
anything suspicious
you guys look at this
Aw
i love him
who is a plushy alien
Coverton has a teddy alien
Does'ums have a binky and a night wight too
it appears to be some sort of advanced interactive animatronic toy
may i B O B
yeah go for it
Try the hug
it is awesome
Check it out
Secret disguise hood
it is kind of suspicious right
Sure fit self snugging underwear
Just say'snug me'
Snug me
Get it off my face
Adaptable alien undergarment technology
Call me intrigued
Ready for action
Record your shutdown code now
hi there
my name is B O B and we are going to be best friends now because you are an alien teddy bear and i love you and
Tell me that was a fresh pair
Doc
Link
what are you guys doing over here
Certainly not snooping on Coverton without telling you
that was good
Really slick
Gah
but cupcakes are kind of funny because nobody ever serves them in a cup
i mean am i supposed to drink it
that is weird right
Shutdown code recorded
where is the leader
where is the leader
oh you mean Susan
Aww
Leader identified
Bad alien teddy bear
we do not try to blast Susan
Stop that
Command received
Repeat your shutdown code to confirm
Shutdown code
uh what
that is not your shutdown code silly
what is that thing
B O B found it in Coverton's room
we thought it was a toy
but in fact it is not a toy
yeah i got that
Shutdown code
of course
you spoke to the teddy alien when it activated
yeah i guess
Well whatever you said it took as a verbal password
to shut it back down you will have to repeat your exact words
all of them
how much did you say to that toy
Seriously
Best hugs ever
Hmm
oh
must not play in Coverton's toy box hmm
Contents may be unsafe for children
Ow
you fuzzy little
B O B it would really help if you could remember that shutdown code
yeah i could totally see how that would help
Go Susan
i got it
Eureka
what is it
a voice print of the shutdown code
each time B O B repeats one of the words he used that section will light up green
Get all the words and we can turn that abomination off
hi there
hi there
yes
hi there was the first thing you told the plushy
Keep going B O B
i am thinking you two could work better without a rampaging alien psycho toy
Link come on
we will lead it somewhere else
Just hurry up with that code
Bye Susan
have fun not getting exploded
Love you
Right B O B
Time to jog your memory
Start reciting the alphabet and when you get to the right letter it should trigger the words
that you are looking for
oh got it
okay  a B Triangle   F backwards R   Smiley face rainbow M 
Wait
M
i think i said something about cupcakes
Cupcakes
Cupcakes actually does not start with the letter M
uh pretty sure it does doc
Mmm
Cupcakes
See
Slight change of plans oh Grand Coverlord
my zed 7 epsilon attack plushy was triggered prematurely but you will love this part
the cretins turned it on themselves and they can not remember their own shutdown code
all i have to do is sit back and
there you are
Occupied
Your machine
you turn it off
and by the way killer plush hidden in your bedroom a little suspicious
Told you he was up to something
so sorry Susan but the zed 7 epsilon is beyond my control
Once activated it won't stop until it is taken down the local leader
Tragic
Really
then why would it attack me
you are the leader
Well of course what
Leader identified
Alien teddy bear and i love you and this one time the Sasquatch pretty pony
we are halfway to the code B O B
oh she is definitely the leader
oh he is the leader
i await your orders commander
Totally not the leader

Sir
Boss
General Monger
Sir
Boss
General
Leader identified

Look around
Try and recreate the moment you first spoke to that devilish dolly
then just shout whatever comes to mind
Go
Intercontinental tooth fairy disco conspiracy
Intercontinental tooth fairy disco conspiracy
Why on Earth would you have said that to a plush toy
Somebody's got to warn the people
General Monger
Good thing i always wear a standard issue missile proof uniform
oh and that protects your soft plushy head too
no it does not
yes
Stop him
we must save
Really need that shutdown code
one last word B O B
you have to remember
Dig deep into that gelatinous mass of head goo
Thinking
Concentrating
Talking out loud while i do it
i remember
that is where Link left the self snugging undies
B O B you mindless genius
Snug me
those are some quality underpants
you did it
Right on
Outstanding Monsters
Whoo hoo
Well done B O B
you may not remember much but you really nailed the important bits
oh yippity dingle doo
Dingle doo
Code complete
oh shut up
Coverton am i to understand you brought an unauthorized killer robotic fuzzball onto my base
it was but an innocent toy
on my planet all playthings are packed with
lasers and missiles that hunt down the local leader
Children and their games
Sir if there is nothing else
Actually just one more thing here

Wolves are strong enough to hunt animals 10 times bigger
Killing a little cat is a piece of cake
i am back
we are sorry son
we should've told you sooner
in a nutshell
as you might've realized we are werewolves
not many left now
you must've been shocked with physical changes
but it is what we go through
it begins when you turn 18
you will turn into a werewolf when it is a full moon
but you will get used to it
it is like a transition from puberty to manhood
Right
we are wolves surrounded by sheep
that is what we are
Living in a human society as wolves
it is very hard
Forget about your friends and school
Mating is a problem too
you can only meet ones of our species
you will know when you see one
Like your dad and i did
what was that for
nothing keep going
do yeon
are you listening
do yeon
i am not keeping it
Beat it
Hey
who do you think you are
what is the point of studying
you have no brain
does it hurt
my hand hurts too
hello
Stop calling me
we see only one side of the moon
that is because the speed of its rotation coincides with that of revolution
Crescent
Waxing Moon
Full Moon
the moon changes its shape due to the angles of the sun moon and earth
in only a few days a crescent becomes a half moon
275 per chicken so
do not stop me
you are cute
do yeon we are werewolves
Fortune for the week
with a lunar aura your life will be completely changed
the one you have a crush on becomes your destiny
i do not know
what is happening to my body and where my heart is
what is certain is that i am still alone
and that i BONG do yeon am a werewolf
what is definitely changed is the fact that i began to learn the joy of life
this is nice
you are all dead meat
what is wrong with it
Stop
Stop

Werewolves do exist

and the montage of a suspect has been released
Excuse me

i do not get a dial tone

Thanks
Your parents are not home
Did you see that news
that reservoir is not far
it is scary to be alone is not it
Let me ask you
what would they do when they face death
would they scream for life
no
when they are extremely terrified they can not think straight
they can not do anything
so
they groan and fall into spasm facing death
that is all
Life is very week
as if a string gets broken
Death comes that easily

the last accident on
April the 16th involved college student LEE with 10 stabs on the chest found after missing for 3 days the beginning of a series of murders
with the continuing murder cases
the residents near Yong dam lake have expressed their concern
the police will draw all its forces to apprehend the killer and reinforce the patrols for the safety of the residents
there are indications that the case might be prolonged the police not being able to find any sort of clue only that the killer might be involved in all cases with victims of the 4 murders being all women in their 20s
the unusual part of the fifth murder is that the victim is a male

Boston Legal Season 4 Episode 1
i can not believe she was an undercover cop
i should've known something was up when she called me handsome
Did you actually give her money
yeah
it is entrapment man
you saw the way she was dressed
my bet i was targeted  Alan Denny  Shirley
Let me introduce Katie Lloyd
she is joining us today
she is fresh out of law school
Very fresh
that took all of one second
Perhaps we can get a cup of coffee later
that took five seconds
Well well well Denny Crane
what are you doing in my law firm
it is not your firm Denny
i am a senior partner
Remember
or has your brain shrunk since we last met
at that time i believe it was the size of a pea
i see you have made a friend  we had a deal Sack
i stay out of New York  you steer clear of Boston
what is he doing here  New sheriff in town Denny
here  let me help you get settled
what do you mean  new sheriff 
i am the sheriff
you have seen my spurs
hello
hello
we will talk about this later
we will talk about it now
okay fine
Go to my office then
Fine
where is it  Very peppy here  yes
uh we apologize for any temporary inconvenience but until the renovations are complete you will be sharing an office
uh Jerry Espenson this is Katie Lloyd
Nice to meet you Jerry
hello
Welcome
hello
Jerry graciously volunteered to share his office
Well i will let you get settled
i believe we have a staff meeting scheduled for 11 00
Brilliant
oh
Well i should perhaps get organized
yes
yes
oh yes
you are pretty
oh you are very kind to say so
and you seem so nice
Thank you for that as well
i am not being forward
do not be alarmed
it is just  not all litigators are nice people
Denise Bauer is nice but she is on maternity
Brad Chase was nice
now he is gone
i was beginning to think nice people do not last long around here
so i am so happy to see another one arrive
this was just assigned to us by the court
Indigent client old lawyer jumped in front of a bus now he needs a new one
what is it
it appears to be a strangulation
i have a murder trial
any advice as to what i should do first
Well i suppose you should first meet with the client
he did not sound very pleasant as the police report read  no he did not  can not say i want to meet him
Arrested for what
Ah it was a conflict of interest
i was involved with this cop who was working on a case that i was  involved with  oh dear God
Alan will take care of it
no he will not
i need Alan
i will get you somebody else  i do not want anybody else
i do not care
i need Alan
now please leave and try not to get arrested on your way out
you said we'd talk about Carl Sack
i lied
Out
now
i did tell Denny I'd help him
here is the deal  i am rich
i soothe my guilt by making various donations most recently one to Stanford to the tune of 3 million
i rescinded and they are suing me
you are being sued by Stanford
my donation was earmarked to develop technologies to combat greenhouse gas emissions
i have since learned Exxon Mobil also made a contribution  100 million
Afraid the study's been bought
i am not giving them my money  so he is in charge of litigation  Apparently  what about Shirley  Evidently she did not want to
is he gonna reshuffle everything
i hear he is a reshuffler
here he comes  hello  hello
uh hello
what is with the shifty eyes son
that was not nice
Sorry
i did not mean anything
Truth is my favorite uncle had eyes exactly like yours
he liked to touch small children in bad places
do you like that son
 he jumped in front of a bus  Evidently
is there anything you can tell me about my client
Well you won't like him
he is cuffed and shackled so you are okay
we will keep the other guard in the corner  i appreciate that  if you need anything 
hello Mr Washington
my name's Katie Lloyd
i will be filling in for Mr Rice who uh suddenly and tragically passed away this week
i will be needing to be brought up to speed somewhat and as such shall be seeking a continuance
i anticipate being successful in that endeavor but in the meantime I'd like to ask you a few questions if you do not mind
Lovely
i expect there is more where that came from
you know  i rescued a dog once from a shelter
he bit me six times before we went on to be fab friends
 you asked to see me  Clarence
yes please
Come in
i feel as though we got off on  a wrong note
do you have any hobbies son
i am not sure what you mean
Well some people golf
Others go fishing
Personally 
i like to google myself in the privacy of my own home
do you ever google yourself son you know in those hard to reach places
i still do not know what you mean and i am finding you to be not very nice
i never forget a face Clarence
and when i saw yours this morning  you know sometimes in addition to googling myself i like to go on YouTube
one of the current favorites is titled  the dancing drag queen 
my favorite part  is coming up right here
now 
i realize i am new here son 
my friend Doris and me entered a contest
it is at King's Row Kenmore
we have made the quarterfinals
i see
and the dress
it is just  something i do sometimes
Clarence  it was not my intent to come in here and start barking directives but i am going to need you to withdraw from  this competition
what  what do you mean
Son we are in the business of law here
a law firm has to be discreet conservative reasonable  modest
you are listed as a part time lawyer at Crane Poole Schmidt and we simply cannot have that 
associated with what we are
but  we are in the quarterfinals
yeah but Clarence Boston is a very small town
i am sorry
and if i refuse to withdraw
you know son 
i am really hoping people do not test me
Alan
Shirley
Lorraine
i suppose it was inevitable we'd finally bump heads a bit
you really should keep your promises Shirley
are you representing Stanford
it is discourteous not to extend a greeting
oh i am sorry
i was distracted by your  neck
will you relax
do not tell me to relax Denny
Telling somebody in an agitated state to relax is like telling a starving man not to be hungry
she is an old girlfriend
the town is full of them
not like her
she has a neck it is long
and she has eyes and  this neck
two necks
Denny 
i had  there is something addictive about this woman and not uh necessarily in a healthy way  i would uh lose myself around her   Hey hey hey hey
Listen to me
we are friends right
i i i i i would do anything to help you with your problems the same as you would do whatever to help me with mine
True  yes
i need you to get Gloria to make my arrest go away
and just like that we are on to your problem
Alan please
i could face jail
Why are you out with hookers in the first place
Sex
What'd you think cribbage
do not you find it a little desperate Denny
a little sad
Let's face it  i am not an attractive man and at my point in life my options are limited
Denny you are very attractive
are you kidding
Your face is  robust it has character
you have got that twinkle in your eyes
you are surprisingly firm
you really think i am attractive
i do
you know i do
may i cut in
no you may not
Denny  you still do answer to your name right
yes i do
and i still run this place
no you do not
what is more you do not want to
you just want to run around drop your pants shoot people date a hooker
how is the mad cow coming
Let's all pause while you compose a comeback
 now you listen to me  Zing
every time somebody counts me out of the game i surprise them
you understand me
not at all
Surprise me
Assistant District Attorney
hello
Terribly sorry
i am uh my name's Katie Lloyd
i am from the law firm of Crane Poole Schmidt
i have just inherited the Joseph Washington case and was wondering if i could trouble you for a continuance
i am sorry did you say Crane Poole Schmidt
that is right
Figures
may i
Get a continuance
Just a a wee one
you can though we only plan to enter a plea
second degree
oh i see
um was there a particular sentence involved
Life
that would work well for your side i suppose
so how much do you know about your client
the relationship's still young  and how old are you  25  have you ever tried a homicide case before  never  you ever tried any case before  never
oh where are my manners
Talking about me
are you married
i beg your pardon
Gloria
i need 
what
oh come on
i had a headache
that is never happened to you
after Denny called and said he'd been arrested i could not  perform
was that the same headache this morning or a different one
the same
i think i will have it as long as these ridiculous charges are hanging over Denny's aching head
now if we could make the charges disappear my feeling is so would the headache
is that why you are here
because let me tell you something Alan 
Gloria spare me the speech
Denny's practically family
this was entrapment
it will be an ugly trial one which you will be a part of as a witness
it is in everybody's favor to make this go away
one of us here has that power
it is not me
Interesting to find out where your priorities lie
so now we know
Alan 
i still want that baby
what do you mean you can not do it
the new head of litigation says i can not
we are  we are in the quarterfinals
i know
i do not  i do not understand
it is not fair
Doris  cross dressing  the public still perceives it as some kind of sickness
Law firms 
it is all about image
 we are in the quarterfinals  i know
you can  do it without me
without you
you know i can not go on stage without you
i was  i was only able to leave my house 18 months ago
i can not lose my job Doris
okay
there is a reason why i gave the money to Stanford
to get your niece in
besides that
Given how much the government has been co opted by the oil companies
i felt at least academic research would be neutral
but now  and this is not just happening at Stanford by the way  Berkeley was given 500 million by a leading oil company
Princeton  do we think for a second these contributions won't tilt these findings or steer them
do you have any evidence that they have
oh yes
the dean put out a memo  we have been bought  what do you think
I'd  I'd like to see that memo please
can you prove that anyone at any of these universities has been bought as you like to call it  no
Nor can we prove any elected officials have been corrupted
we are not talking about the government here Shirley
this is a private entity which you pledged to give money to in order to support research that 
but i no longer trust that research
Sorry
a study to explore alternative energy sources essentially funded by an oil company  would you swallow that  3 2 6 6 7  people vs Joseph Washington 
Good afternoon your honor
Brad Chase for the commonwealth
Good afternoon your honor
Katie Lloyd
i will be entering my appearance on behalf of Mr Washington
the parties are prepared to offer a plea agreement at this time
Mr Washington will agree to plead guilty to murder in the second degree
both the commonwealth and the defense offer a joint recommendation for a life sentence
this is acceptable to you Ms Lloyd
it is your honor
Thank you
Mr Washington you understand that by pleading guilty you are admitting to the charges of the commonwealth's complaint alleging that on the night of November 2 2006 you with malice aforethought raped and murdered Annie Harris Rivers
you further understand that you most likely be serving the remainder of your natural life in maximum security prison
Mr Washington 
i need a response from you
Mr Washington
Sir if i do not get a verbal response from you i cannot accept your plea
Counsel have you spoken to your client
yes your honor
one last time Mr Washington do you understand and accept the terms of this plea agreement
the plea is rejected
we will have opening statements Tuesday 10 00 a M
Adjourned
Your honor i am sorry
i just got this case
might i get a continuance  no  Your honor it would seem in the interest of justice   Justice
Look back there Mr Chase
i do not have to tell you that the husband of the victim has shown up in this courtroom repeatedly only to learn that the defendant has yet again fired his lawyer at the last second
Mr Washington's previous attorney was not fired
he jumped in front of a bus
i do not care
i will see you Tuesday at 10 00
what do you mean
it is going to trial
i thought they reached a plea
Seems our client did not reach it
or if so was unwilling to communicate as much
Look as much as I'd like to do this i have never tried anything
and Brad Chase is the DA
Hey you
 is it uh Jerry  yes
Assist Ms Lloyd with her murder trial
okay
i just got put on a murder case
Murder
can you believe it
you seem excited  all of you
what is wrong
Sack  made me withdraw from the singing contest
what
how did he even know about it
Sorry
Somebody took video and put it on YouTube so  now i am out
but you are in the quarterfinals
i know
this Sack is a bad bad person
i do not like this Sack
what about Doris
she is  destroyed
Tell Alan
he will fix it
or tell Shirley
i can fight my own battles
Clearly you can not Clarence
i did not mean it like that
Tell Alan
he will fix that sackhead
Tell him
most of the tenants maintain that you were an excellent and very reliable custodian
but several alluded to a possible obsession you had with the victim
one woman remarked that she thought you invented maintenance issues in Mrs Rivers' unit just to get close to her
is any of this true
Your semen was found inside and on the victim
i am sure you have been told this
Mr Washington you must talk to us
Mr Washington  we will go in and fight very hard for you but you need to help
may i speak with you a second
Only if you can make it quick Clarence
i am off to court
okay
i quit
a little less quick
i entered a singing contest as Clarice with a friend
we have made the quarterfinals
Carl Sack found out said cross dressers are not commensurate with the firm's image
he told me to withdraw or else
i am choosing else
i thought  Clarice was on sabbatical
she still comes out sometimes
i entered the contest as her
it is the only way i could get on stage and sing but if i want to keep going i will get fired
so i decided I'd quit and save everybody some time
all right look  there is no way i would let Carl Sack fire you
Having said that two things can happen here
i can fix this or you can
Your goal is to be a full time lawyer here is it not
yes
Well then i would suggest you go make your case to Carl Sack  as you
you asked to see us your honor
yes
Thank you
you will be dropping the charges against Denny Crane immediately
Thank you
there a problem
the charges are valid
no they are not
i was there counsel at least earlier in the evening
i saw the officer's behavior as well as her attire
she cultivated any predisposition on Mr Crane's part
this is beyond entrapment
you are done
with all due respect your relationship with the defendant's best friend 
has no bearing whatsoever but it would certainly be called into play should this case ever reach trial which would really piss me off
and i do not think you really mean to incur the wrath of a superior court judge especially one that can be such a bitch
you will drop it today before any further investigation reveals Mr Crane to be a target
Get out
for the past 11 years i have taught a class at Harvard on oil and economics and i have focused specifically on capture  Capture  yes
Big oil capturing academia
it is already happened in the United Kingdom now it is happening here
and they do this by donating money
yes
their sponsorship has some influence obviously but what is even more dangerous is that it is an insidious recruiting tool
Oil companies are making their branding visible to young impressionable students
and by the way we have already seen some universities actually tailor their course curriculum to serve the industry
but let's be fair
some of these courses are geared toward reducing fossil fuel dependency
yes but most of the research is geological where to find new oil fields and how to exploit them
it is ridiculous
do you have any information as to the pledge made by Ms Schmidt to Stanford
no
do you have any opinion as to whether a valid contract was formed here or not
no
you really can not win this Alan
the courts consider these donations binding contracts
People reconsider financial pledges all the time
and get sued
Come on
Stanford doesn't want the publicity of a trial here
Make me an offer and i will go away
if you want me to go away
oh
i had a dream not too long ago about  you in an elevator
Really
was i going up or going down
what are you doing
is it serious with this judge
Lorraine start the elevator
you start it
i am not in a good enough shape for this
for what
you dropped your trial bag
Did i
you and i should not  be  doing  a case together
i agree
we need to settle it do not we
Make me an offer
Right in the elevator
yeah i know
i am in a monogamous relationship for God's sake
one founded very much on trust
Alan here is the thing about monogamy  it only works if you cheat
Please do not be glib Denny
i am not at all happy about this
i am sorry
what are you doing
i am checking on your flow
i got weak stream syndrome
you got nice velocity there
Look at me
that is not so bad
oh please
i have seen drip coffee percolate faster
Denny you are 75
it is fine
oh see that was good
you are not just saying so
you are a little red there
Mm
it is ashamed
Knows it is been bad
what  what
what do you mean go with you
uh i need to put a human face on it
Well why can not you put your face on it
i will
i just want to add yours
it will help Doris
we can go right in to see him  tomorrow
what is going on
we are gonna make our case with Sack  we 
i will do the talking
how is the murder case going
Horrible
the client left blood semen fingerprints and he won't talk to us
Horrible
i apologize for my coarse language
Katie's gone back to try again but he won't talk
it is awful
we go to trial in five days Mr Washington
you need to talk to me
the evidence is insurmountable  your semen at the scene traces of her blood on your locker your confession which did not exactly advance our cause
and if you do not cooperate with us then we will have 
Aah
down
down
Get down
you should probably go counselor
no
may we continue Mr Washington
Please help my client up
 you got him  yeah
you get one more chance Joe
Solitary's next
all right
Mr Washington  did you not commit this crime
i asked you a question
Did you not commit this crime
you are innocent
we were together for about 6 months
Secret  that is the way she wanted it
and the liaisons would always take place in her apartment
the night that she was killed you were there
uh we got together around 5 00
she was killed around 6 00
it had to have happened just after i left
her blood on your locker 
Somebody put it there
Somebody had to have put it there
but he confessed
after 36 hours of sleep deprivation and who knows what other kind of coercion
Jerry this is a man who is never received a break from anybody
every lawyer he is ever had has tried to plead him guilty
he is just resigned himself to being convicted
Well if he did not do it who did
i haven't the slightest idea
she was seeing a therapist
if we can establish that she and Joseph were having an affair  i am gonna pay him a visit
Katie our client  have you seen his priors
i think he is innocent
i really do
the idea that we would contaminate our findings is as  preposterous as it is offensive
Well if you are given say 100 million by somebody do not you at least feel some obligation to pay the piper a little
Well if by  pay the piper  you mean fudge the science no
i must admit i know nothing about this uh research funding business
in my line of work if somebody who should remain neutral takes money from one of the interested parties we call that a bribe
there is no quid pro quo whatsoever
so these oil companies give you money to find ways to put them out of business because 
we do not ask what their expectations are because they are not relevant
Well do you think maybe they are doing this for the environmental good
Objection
Counsel is being very  naughty
i would appreciate it if you could stop with the little  comments in there
what comments  Naughty  and uh uh uh well n naughty
i was simply objecting to your cross
Perhaps it was your conscience saying  naughty 
or maybe your id
you have a very active id Alan
i do not want to play Lorraine
but it is what i do
you never complained before
Forget it
not a chance
uh  Mr Sack
Clarence
this is Doris Thumper
you may remember seeing her on the video
i do
you have got quite the voice Doris
Thank you
Doris and i met in shyness therapy three years ago
she was borderline agoraphobic at the time
Wow
you have made progress
yes
this singing contest is maybe the biggest thing that is happened to her
Maybe me too
i have decided not to withdraw
have you
if you choose to fire me that is your right
Thank you
uh  i am  not sure why you came here
Maybe it was to remake this law firm into something 
Resembling a law firm
i understand the decision to project conservatism and reasonableness and modesty but Boston is full of those firms
as is New York and  well i guess every city
the people i went to law school with work at many of them
they all have one thing in common
they are not happy
People here are
Maybe because they are not afraid of themselves
one lawyer likes to purr and hop
Partners and associates  have sex with each other sometimes
we have got two men who take five minutes out of every single day to celebrate their friendship on a balcony
now how many people do you know who actually do that
i occasionally throw on a dress and i like to sing
i do not want to be one of those lawyers at other firms choking on  modesty and reasonableness
i am surprised that you do
if your mission here is to make this into a normal 
law firm 
i really hope you fail  for everybody's sake
it is a valid contract  properly negotiated both parties were knowing consenting willing
if she had wanted to place certain restrictions on her donation she certainly could have
she did not
hello
now as for big oil getting involved in research to combat global warming are we seriously against that
my God
for years we have been hammering them   you are a big part of the problem
be part of the solution 
now thankfully some of these companies are trying to do just that and given that they are billion dollar companies if they want to join the fight against greenhouse emissions that should make us well  orgasmic
are you not just a little
Let's look at what is happened in Washington
These huge uh corporations that poison our drinking water foul our air uh lay waste to our lands have discovered that instead of trying to influence government better to simply become government
and with a little help from a friend in a very high place they have done just that
over 100 top environmental posts have been passed out to representatives of polluting industries
can you fathom that judge
do not you be asking me to fathom
i am not a uh fathomer
Almost every agency responsible for protecting America from pollution is now being headed up by somebody from the pollution industry
the fix is in
how does this involve Stanford university
it involves a need in this country for independent unbiased uncorrupted environmental research
and since it is obviously not coming from Washington academia is obviously our best if not our only hope
and now it too is being co opted by big pollution
the facts are that the oil industry has systematically campaigned to create doubt as to the very existence of global warming pumping millions of dollars into think tanks consumer groups media outlets uh religious and civic organizations every penny aimed at diffusing the concern over climate change
now they are privatizing university research 
Berkeley Princeton now Stanford
do we truly want our universities  the breeding grounds for tomorrow's leaders innovators visionaries  do we truly want them climbing into bed with the oil companies  Strange bedfellows  Lorraine stop it
Your honor at some point a little common sense has to prevail in this country
we have started a war in part for oil one we may never get out of in our lifetime
of all the industrialized nations in the world we are the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and we do the least about it
we thumb our nose at the Kyoto treaty
our government actually censors scientific reports from the E P a and others to edit out little findings they do not like
Even the uh democratic presidential hopefuls uh do not talk about this because they do not want to jeopardize their campaign contributions from big oil
Big oil big politics  do we all really intend to sit quietly as they infiltrate vital academic research
is that what we want
is that who we are
may i ask just a couple of questions
Certainly
you did go to law school right
and you Jerry you have actually practiced i have been told
you are a mean mean man and i do not like what you said to Clarence
and i do not think you fit in here at all because you are a mean mean man
Care to button that with a hop
okay Jerry i am a good man just a very poor wizard
and unless either of you happen to be wizards why are not you pleading this case out
i tried
Joseph would not answer the judge
so she refused to accept the plea
as far as i understand it Joseph was not speaking because he was an uncommunicative beast
now he is talking
he trusts you
so he should trust your recommendation that he plead to second degree murder
there is only one problem
he is innocent
i beg your pardon
he did not kill that woman
Ah
and you know this how
he told me  oh he told you  Mean
 what is going on  Great news
the client has declared his innocence
I'd appreciate you not being snide
this goes to trial Tuesday this Tuesday
oh did i mention they have no defense
Alan you take over
me
what about Jerry
Please
at a minimum we could use your involvement to get judge Glo glo recused that could buy us some time
and Katie no offense but you are not ready for this
i understand
there is a suppression hearing scheduled for tomorrow
Shirley i am not ready for this
you have tried cases on the fly before
not first degree murder
you say he confessed
he did
that is what we are trying to suppress
and as for evidence
Joseph was the last one seen with her alive
uh his semen was found on her her blood on his locker
and he has a violent criminal past
he is nothing but a mean mean man this sackhead  What'd he do now  oh he is just mean and snide and smug
i expect him to fire me any second
i thought you quit
Well i am giving him time to reconsider  what  reconsider 
from the way you explained it you said you quit  Shh  i thought you quit  Told ya
i thought maybe you'd change your mind
you thought I'd change my mind
so you really did not quit
Well in that case you are fired
oh sorry
first i was kidding
second if i were not you do not head butt ever
you may keep your job Clarence
i thought about what you said
i agree
People need to be embraced sometimes for their differences instead of being excluded
we talk it
i suppose we should walk it
Good luck with your contest
Hug
uh you are welcome to come watch
8 00
Maybe next time
Shame
i can not believe you did that
oh shut up
i want to know why Carl Sack was brought in here
because i need help managing things
you got me
yeah you are one of the things i need help managing  all your nonsense
so how'd it go with the hooker  oh case was dropped  Great
and  why the waders
Well  i may not be the lawyer i once was but i can still fish circles around all of you
and sometimes i just 
like to put them on and 
when  when i was in high school 
i was captain of the debate team class president and miserable over being cut from the cheerleading team
so i 
i went out and bought my own outfit complete with pom poms
i would dress up and stand in front of the mirror in the little skirt the white socks the sweater
it it somehow made me feel better
and  then y years after  after i was a lawyer even a partner if i was feeling particularly low
i would pull out that costume and put it on
you know i used to do the same thing
without the pom poms of course but 
you are just determined not to let me have a vulnerable moment are not you
you want to hog them all to yourself
Denny  we are getting older
we we do not even fit in our outfits anymore but  we are not over not by a long shot
you are not over
Y you know what used to make me feel better than anything
if it is sexual i do not want 
no no no no it was back when we  were  us   you used to put your head on my   Denny
i was gonna say  shoulder  
that felt better than anything 
i remember you singing  you are my Sunshine 
would you would you do that just for a minute
Put your head on my shoulder
Denny 
i just want to remember
i do not think my neck even bends anymore
Please 
Sure
oh this feels
would you put on that cheerleader outfit just for a 
do not push it
 you are my sunshine   my only sunshine  you make me happy  when skies are grey  you will never know dear 
Mr Washington  hello
may i call you Joseph
how about  chuckles  then
i realize you have formed a  special bond with Katie
she pulled a thorn from your paw like Aesop's fable
but this is the real world and she is never tried a case before
i doubt very much yours can be won but if there is any hope  it is not Katie Lloyd
you are not right for me
Why is that
you think i am guilty
Mr Washington 
i have no idea if you are guilty and frankly i do not care
but here is the thing about confessions and
leaving semen on a victim 
Your hand is on my knee
that is either a threatening gesture or sexual
Either way i am not comfortable
i know about the real world Mr Shore
i lived my whole life in the real world
Katie Lloyd will be my lawyer
i is he out of his mind
I'd suggest he plead insanity but i think he'd kill me
so what happens now
Well they have the motion to suppress the confession at 11 00
i hope to get back for that
Alan he cannot trust his life to Katie and Jerry
all rise
be seated
all right
the case here presents very complicated and challenging issues which i find to be extremely complicated and uh challenging
i do not know what Ms Schmidt thought when she pledged her donation
Truth is i did not understand half of what was said by anybody
therefore as a matter of law there is been no meeting of the minds
Your honor it is not your mind that need meet up with anything
Silence
i am the decider
and i have made my  deciding act
there is no binding contract
Judgment in favor of Ms Schmidt
the law wins out again barely
Alan thank you
Really
Congratulations
Thank you Lorraine
no hard feelings
None 
i assure you
oh please
all right Ms Lloyd i will hear from you
Thank you your honor
may it please the court the prosecution seeks to admit as evidence an oral confession made by our client Joseph Washington which confession upon information and belief was the product of a coercive involuntary and unconstitutional interrogation
lasting days in duration the entirety of which my client was without counsel present pursuant to his Sixth Amendment right
Your honor the suspect never asked for a lawyer
in fact he never said anything and the fact that his confession was made after a protracted interrogation does not make it involuntary
may it please the court
i would argue that sleep deprivation constitutes physical discomfiture
he was allowed to sleep
he was left alone many times
never for more than an hour
there was no bed
Just a chair and a concrete floor
90 of all confessions are obtained in exactly this way
a suspect is worn down
it is an accepted form of police practice
that doesn't make it right
if you read the text Mr Washington shouted out in frustrated defiance repeatedly
his so called confession was a product of duress
so why not just argue that to the jury and let them weigh in on the probative value
Well first of all once you say  confession  people just draw conclusions
second your honor with all due respect the only means we would have for challenging the validity of the confession is to put our client on the stand
if we do that they get to introduce all his prior felonies which could be more prejudicial than the confession even
Look i have no doubt that your client was subjected to relentless pressure
but it did not rise to the point of coercion
i am going to allow the evidence of the confession
we will see you all in division 16
we will be fine
what if i forget to breathe
we will be okay
i think you should go on first Clarence
no we rehearsed it with you
i know i should not be seeing the girls before their wigs and pasties are on but here you go
Alan thank you
you came  of course i came
this must be Doris
Doris Thumper Alan Shore  you look lovely  Thank you
Shirley wanted to come but she had a dinner
we are not going on
yes we are
Maybe
we are afraid
Well of course you are
how could you not be
it is a contest
oh if only you knew what i know  what do you know  that you are gonna be great
that when the wig goes on and Clarice comes out and Doris begins to wiggle you are gonna be spectacular
what are you doing here
oh
Trying to acquire some sort of comfort with this room
it is even bigger than the last one
i thought you were arguing very well right up to  when you froze
Jerry the idea of me trying this case is utterly ridiculous
do you think perhaps you could first chair
i could but  there is a risk
sometimes jurors find me  different
Why
Surely you have noticed i have a few odd tics
Well we all have our tics
some are just better disguised than others
from what i see making Joseph Washington seem human and if possible likable is our biggest challenge here
the jury can not help but be struck by your  humanity and kindness
they will be rooting for you  and by association perhaps him
i will be right by your side
Together we can do this
but Joseph Washington's best chance is if the face of our defense is you
Clearly  he seems to know that
okay our third entry tonight is a duet coming from two very sexy ladies
Singing a song from the movie  Hairspray  please give a warm King's Row welcome to Doris Thumper and Clarice Bell  Hey you made it  Just in time
i know none of the facts of this case i haven't even seen the police report
but look  is that a guilty man or what
i mean what kind of society would presume this animal innocent
Look at him
Put me on the jury
i will vote to fry him before the trial even starts
and that reminds me 
is this for real
most trusted name in news
do we really care if they sizzle a little before dying
Boo hoo hoo
we are talking about the scum of the earth here and we are supposed to make it pleasant for them
Come on
we are throwing them to the wolves  Katie and Jerry
Shirley even if we did put more lawyers on it there is nothing they can do
Carl  i need you to tread more lightly
this firm  it is not like the New York branch
i could always go back
you know Jerry
he said i am a poor fit
i do not want you to go back
you sure
Sure
what is the occasion
i got so  inspired by Clarence's performance as Clarice
i decided to  whip out my Lennon Sisters dress
should i put mine on
it is not necessary i just thought i  seize the silliness
it is good for the heart you know
meanwhile they made the semi finals Denny
it was so  thrilling  for us for them both of them
These two  terribly shy people basking in the spotlight on a stage with  everybody
Forget it  i was just looking  Well stop looking
i do not like being  objectified
Did you know  that Shirley Schmidt has a cheerleading costume
sometimes she puts it on
Really
can you imagine Shirley doing a little cheer
with a little pleated skirt
and the white socks
all of it
oh my God
i so often think how  lucky we are to have as a senior partner Shirley Schmidt
and now in a cheerleading outfit
we are lucky
Period
we live good lives
yes we do
now take your day for example
Sex in an elevator
twice
with a woman not your own
Help save the environment fight global warming taking a rocking show after work and then  throw on a dress as a nightcap
and later i get to close my eyes and think 
of Shirley Schmidt
in a cheerleading costume
oh my God
the little pleated 
all of it
we live  very good lives

as a servant of God it is my duty to hear your confession and request God to forgive you
Tell me
Tell me what sin have you committed
i haven't done any sin till now
but now i am going to do 3 murders
People come here to confess and get forgiveness for their sins
but you are talking about the sin you are going to commit
i did not understand this
i do not wish that after committing a sin my feet should stain this holy place
i am innocent now
but after today i will never come here
Listen to me
lf you kill a human being God willnever forgive you
i am not going to kill a human
i am going to remove the traces of three beasts from this world
at such a time
the call of my soul is more intense than my religious duty
i am sure God will forgive me
as per the rel ig ious order i must not see the face of the confessor
so i haven't seen your face till now
you are going to do a sin
i wish to talk to you in my room

Very good Doctor
Mr Mahesh Sandilya who sel ls liquor has given a stat ement that when Mary died David was in police custody and he did David's bai i
but in police records there is no mention of David's arrest
and there is no witness too
no
he is lying he is lying
S it down
Apart from this when i arrest ed him
he accept ed his crime before 2 rich and responsi ble men
he wrot e that stat ement himself and gav e it to me
i have su bm itt ed it in the court
as a doctor who has done the post mort em of Mary's corpse it is my duty to give an honest stat ement
the ca use of Mary's death was not an accidentor su icide
lnf act she was m u rdered with cruelty
the wou nds on her body are a proof of this
Mary was an ed ucat ed g i rl from a rich f am i ly
David was not worthy of her
S o she began having e xtra marital aff ai rs
David confided one day he can not bear her ad u it ery
i advised him to speak to Mary and ask her to be f aithfu i
but lnever thoug ht he would kill her
no husband can bear his wife's ad u it ery
S o i req uest the court to have mercy on him
the way people crucified Jesus C h rist
i had only heard about it
but today i even saw it
what will happen to him
do not worry about him
now he is my son
i will close the liquor business
I'llnot do any bad business now
it is my duty to make him an honest and nice man like you
lt' i l be better if you kill him
lnst ead of the words of Bi ble the fire of revenge must bu rn in his heart
Beca use after 2 0 years when i am released

i may not have the strength to mat ch the fire in my heart
at that time he will be my support
He' i l be my strength
S ee Mahesh
lf you are my friend
lf you like me
then make this boy a dangerous criminal
what are you saying
Wi i l any father say this for his son
the one who raped his mother
the people who pu n ished his father with life sent ence in jail
lf he doesn't take revenge from such rog ues he is not a man
you are right David
you were so happy with your wife and child
those 3 rog ues notonly bu rnt your happiness but also def amed you
it is my duty to take revenge from those 3 rog ues
you want him to be a criminal
i will make him such a dangerous man hearing his name people will sh iv er
i take an oath David
i was playing h ide and seek
Breakf ast
it is ready come
where is the pistol
Please listen to me with a cool mind
Years back f ew men did a m istake
it is no use of taking revenge now
i mean it is not good to roam with a pistol
it is my duty to take revenge from those 3 rog ues
you want him to be criminal
i will make him such a dangerous man hearing his name people will sh iv er
i take an oath David
a man wat ch ing a d rama can only preach
he can not f eel the person's pain
anyway
where is my son
David
i
this is lshwarlal and the one who is being beat en inside is S om lal
they are the mem bers of an int ernational gang
Apart from printing f alse money they d ressed as police officers and loot ed the nearby vi i lages
that is okay but stop Vijay else he m ig ht kill that man in anger
lnspector Vijay please stop
it is the DlG's order
Stop
Please stop
leave me
i gav e your son the love of a mother and father
on ly i could not give him mother's m i i k
as that was not possi ble
i gav e him everything and made him a police inspector
i thoug ht when you come back you will give me a reward great
you gav e me such a big reward
how could you make him a police officer
do not you know that rog ue was also a policeman who saved the rascal who raped my wife and my son's mother
Did n't you know that because of a policeman i spent 2 4 years in jail
and you made my son a police officer
you had taken an oath
on what basis did you fu lfi i l it
you were ang ry then
E lse can any father wish for his son to be a criminal
i am a fool to prom ise you for the sak e of friendsh i p
but when i reached home i realized it is not a sin to do liquor business
but to instill the poison of hatred in a child's life is a sin
i decided to bear your anger but i won't spoi i the boy's life
lf you want you can h it me
E lse take my shoe and beat me
Did n't my son ev er ask in these years about his mother
Tell me
he asked many times
what did you say
i said she died
Did n't you say how she died
i said she died d ue to small po x
Why did you i ie
i did not know you will react like this
Did you tell him his father is rotting in jail for 2 4 years
Did you
no
Why
i told him i am his father
you
you said that you
you are his father
do not f eel bad
i will tell you the truth
he called me Baba' and those were his first words
i am not his father but i was very happy to hear Baba
i became his father from that day
for his sak e i left all bad habits
God also hel ped me
i ed ucat ed him but never told him your story
Beca use i knew he will get en raged
S o lnever came to see you in jail
i beGof you
Please do not ev er tell him that i am not his father
do not take him away from me
to bright en my life i asked you to i ig ht a lam p
but you bu rnt me and bright ened your life
okay
you can keep your son
These old bones are still strong
to ach iev e my goal i do not need you or your son
where is the pistol
you have come after so many years
Atleast see your son once
you will forget the revenge
i forgive you today
but do not e xpect such decency from me again
lf you ev er try to arouse the emotion of a father in me
my first victi m will be my son
S orry will be your son
i have given you bi rth'

they are waiting since long to bu ry the corpse

Constable

Th in k once more and then answer
when that man conf essed to you that he will m u rder 3 men
Did n't you f eel like seeing his face
Sir i am a cathol ic priest
We' re not perm itt ed to see the face of the conf essor
we can not even d isclose the conf ession
then why are you d isclosing it
i felt it is more em inent to save the lives of 3 men
S o i resig ned from priesthood and came here
now it is your duty to save their lives
you do not know that man's descri ption
you do not even know the men he is going to kill
without knowing this what can the police do
Pol ice is not God to know everything
you are absol ut ely right
this is like cat ch ing a black cat in the dark
it is better to d rop this case
lsn't it
Father you can go
do not make hast e
Th in k th in k something
from his conf ession we know he is a sta u nch Cathol ic
S o he must have had the f aith that
Father won't tell anyone about his conf ession
that is fine
but knowing this doesn't hel p us
you are right
that is the reason i did not d iscuss this point
i mean i did not raise this point
yes son tell me how will it hel p
it will hel p in a way that th roug h newspapers and T V we can say Father notonly d isclosed his conf ession but also gav e his descri ption to the police
there will be chaos in the city
every man has some enemy
the whole city will demand for police prot ection
lt' i l creat e a pan ic
you are right but we will benefit in two ways
when he will know that
Father has d isclosed his conf ession to the police
he may attack Father in a rel ig ious f ervor
lf he does that we can arrest him easi ly
and if doesn't do that then after knowing that police is aware of his int entions he may delay his plan to kill and we will get some more time
Your idea is great
i have told you so many times not to intrude in the department matt ers
Go inside
i f eel your suggestion is right
Ev en i had thoug ht about this
yes
Mr Vijay i f eel you can start the inv estigation
yes
S hall we go
yes
lf you find any suspicious man near the church do not start the inq u i ry first let me know
the plain clothed Constables near the Father's house who are looking at g i rls passing by ask them to be alert
Ask Father to come and sitoutside
lf he sits inside how will anyone attack him
Assure him we have taken measures for his saf ety
he doesn't need to f ear
the inspector of C hem bu r police station has called you atonce
Why he says a Father is there who clai ms to know everything about the 3 murders that may happen
Did the Father say anything about it to the inspector
no
he says he will tell the detai ls to the S uperintendent of Police
and he insists that he should be taken to the S P
Ask him to wait i am com ing
i am hand i ing this case so tell me what you know about the criminal
i told the inspector before you
i will tell the detai ls only to the S uperint endentof Pol ice
that is fine but i should know how much the S P should know
no no
J ust a m in ut e Father
Why are you insisting on meeting the S P
Beca use in this case some of the police officers are also involv ed
Maybe they will try to hel p the criminal
the police convicts the criminals they do not hel p them
ln your age i too had f aith in this bel ief
but i was betrayed
anyway will i get the perm ission to meet the S P
Please wait here
lnspector Vijay is hand i ing this case
we have f aith in him
you can tell him everything
Ev en i want ed Vijay to know everything but but later i thoug ht i will tell you everything myself
lf youperm it I'd like to search him
Let him do his duty
you said he is a very sincere officer
Why this bandage
this is an old wou nd
it is not healed yet
Why do not you go to a special ist
there are 3 special ists in my mind
with great d ifficu lty i have got an appointment with the firstone
ln the morning a fi le had come from the DlG's office
this one did you see it
yes
i saw it
now tell me who is this criminal and who is he going to kill
when is he going to kill them and why
lt' i l take me time to tell the detai ls so

i have writt en everything about that criminal on this paper
Please read this

an honest police officer will come and open this door
and he will be the ca use of your death
Behave sensi bly
yes start that
this will be a lesson for corrupt police officers like you
no no
was not it a great j u m p
i was so proud of you
i used to give your e xam ple to sen ior officers and asked them to em u lat e your sense of duty
i did not you to be so careless and fool ish
i have been in the service for 2 4 years and ne xt year i will reti re
it is another thing that in these years i did not solv e any case
but in lnever did such fool ish ness
Am i right
you said you went in the control room and opened the chan nel to Sahay's room
that man spok e to him for 1 0 m in ut es before the m u rder
Why did not you open that chan nel before
what were you doing
ln what work were you busy
Tell me
this is your first m istake and i hope it is your last m istake
Please forgive me
Beca use of my fool ish ness people are blam ing you
i am upset to see t ears in your eyes
but for 2 4 years i have shed t ears of blood in darkness
you have to pay for that

Today's lat est news
S P Sahay's m u rderer is rev ealed
David was released a f ew days back
Pol ice suspects that David's ne xt victi m can be Dr Verma

he recog n iz ed my voice
he wants to tal k to you
what do you want

i have asked Pandey to trace the call

the Doctor's life is dear to you or your da ug ht er's
Pol icemen do not bother for relations or love
lf anything happens to my da ug ht er i will consider it my i i l fate
but i won't hand the Doctor to you
you can do what you want
you made a i ittle hast e
we could take a chance
we should have f ou nd out which place he wants to meet the Doctor
i am sure there could be a breakth roug h
we did a pu bl icity in papers and on T V that we' re keeping the Doctor at a place which no one knows
the fu n ny thing is i am hard ly here for 1 0 m in ut es and he calls me
Doesn't it pro v e he is more intell igent more smart er than us
i can not trust you and risk a person's life
Ev en if i have to sacrifice my da ug ht er's life for that
Please let me take the call
i do not want you to com prom ise because of Vinita
i am not com prom ising
i am only doing my duty as a police officer
We' re ready to give you the Doctor

i will start the train again
Listen

Aft er i reach home father and Vijay will ask me about the place where you kept me
but i won't tell anything
Why do you trust me so much
Please tell me why do you trust me so much
S uppose God forbid if someone rapes you

Answer me what will you do
lf possible l' ll kill him

my wife has committed su icide
i am doing the duty of kill ing them
lf you f eel what i am doing is j ustified
then do not tell them anything
E lse do what you f eel is right
he is a m u rderer
it is my duty to arrest him
Ti i l i am working in this department there can be no relation between me and the killer
when he th rew the rope to save me i was as su rprised as you are
he tried to save your life as you are his best friends son
you had given me David's case fi le
we only look ed at those witnesses who gav e a t esti mony against David
but today in the morning when i read this fi le again
lnoticed a witness who gav e the t esti mony in f avor of David
and that man was country liquor v endor Mahesh Sandilya
that is your father
Aft er being released David inq u i red about your father f ou nd him out and met him
a reti red Col lector is an eye witness to this
i know what you are trying to say
do not forget you are keeping a wat ch on Mahesh Sandilya noton your father
you have come
are you fine
Did David give you any problem
he is not an insensitiv e man like my father and your son
they had left me to die
but David gav e a pistol for my prot ection and sent me back
he is a very nice man a saint
he is a very nice man i know it since a long time
Today even you know it
no one understands him
okay tell me what will you have
something hotor
Why are you staring like that
how do you David is a nice man
i said because he sent you back saf ely
he sent me back today but you said you know him since long
Did i say that
yes
you have put me in a d i lem ma
do not try to avoid it
how do you know David
Let it be do not ask anything else
lf i am trapped once i won't be able to escape
i am going
O h my God
he too had to come now
this is a tal k between us we will do it later
lf Vijay asks you about David do not tell him anything
Keep q u iet like this
my dear son how are you
and tell me how
Poor thing escaped from that killer and has j ust arriv ed
S he is very scared she can not even tal k
S he is only saying daddy daddy
Come child i will leave you home
how did youreach here
i am asking you how did youreach here
i do not need to answer your q uestions
a killer held me captiv e for the whole night
you and father made no effort to save me
lnf act you left me to die
now i have come here you are asking how i reached here not how i am
i am sorry i did not try to save you last night
now answer my q uery
i told you she d uped David and ran away
he has fooled the enti re police force and she will d upe him
okay then th in k that he himself left her here
S he has reached home saf ely we do not want anything else
Wi i l you keep q u iet
Come here

you know my duty is more important to me than relations
i have was h u m i i iat ed because of you once
Hel p me to cat ch that crook
where did David h ide you
it is very hot should i puton the f an
Listen Vinita
Your answer can save a man's life
Tell me where did he keep you
you are q uestion ing a h u ng ry g i rl
not father daddy or Baba
you are call ing me by name
you are my son
Rig ht now i am a police officer please go now
Tell me
where did he take you
i do not know
Wherev er he took me he bl indf olded me
and when he left me i was bl indf olded even then
you are lying
he may or may not have bl indf olded you but you'v e decided to fool me
Good the trou ble has gone
i am saved
than k God
i f eared you may come u nder his pressure and tell the truth
but you act ed very well great
i was acting but now you do not act before me
Tell the truth
who is David
i am trapped
Tell me u ncle
David is not my son
what nonsense
Nonsense
i have had one peGonly lf i have a second peg i will tal k better
now i will say the truth
Your lover Vijay he is not my son
he is David's son
he tried to save your life as you are his best friend's son
Aft er being released from jail he inq u i red about your father f ou nd him and met him at your home
Mr Vijay when you become old you will look like this killer David
this is not the fire station
Everyone's after me
David you
have you gone mad
ls this the time to come here
Vijay must be com ing
before you he will shoot me
Why have you come here
Tell me
Listen
you may not bother about your life
but Vijay val ues his respect
Th in k about it Vijay is a f amous police officer
lt' i l be d isastrous for him to know
Mahesh Sandilya who broug ht him up is not his father
you are his father
lf he knows about his father he is ask about his mother
we will have to tell him the second secret
Wi i l you be able to tell your son that his mother died because she was raped
and when he will know that he was prot ecting the rog ues who raped his mother and sent his father to jail
he will be devastat ed
Listen David

Vijay is not my son
but i have given him more love than one can give his own son
Ev en he loves me very much
lf knows this bitt er truth he will leave me and go away
i will open the door you leave before Vijay comes here
do not go from here
i will open the other door
Go from here
David where are you
Why are you crying
U nderstood
you have changed after what i said
you have improved lsn't it
you want to su rrender for the sak e of Vijay's futu re lsn't it
do not worry
ln the past it was different
Your friend did not have the money
but today i have money
i will fig ht your case well
Wait here i will tal k to the police
lnspector you are not arresting David
he is su rrendering himself
S o you must treat him with respect
Tell this to Vijay also
no need to shak e my hands
it is my duty as a police officer's father
what is this
you knew everything about the criminal but till 2 murders you gav e no information to the police
to know more about this you are arrest ed
Why arrest the witness
Arrest the cu i prit
he is
Come on Sir
one m in ut e
i want to speak to my son no to lnspector Vijay in privat e
i loved you so much
so much that my heart became em pty
and youplayed this game with me
the elders were right
a man's real son is his own
someone else's son can not be our own
Why have you come here
what have you come here for
that day when yourealized who i am you let me go
Today when i realized who you are i came here
Your old friend Mahesh S h inde told me everything about you
you stood as my father in law d u ring the marriage ceremony
for you to bless me or for me to invit e you to my house

Perhaps it is not in our destiny
that is why i have come here with f ood today
Please come and have f ood
Perhaps your sorrows have overcome you appetit e
Still eat a i ittle to make me happy
for me
may you live a thousand years
i do not even know how you are
what is this
Resignation
you th in k a resignation could stop an officer from arresting your dad
had it been about arresting my father i would n't have resig ned
i am still ready to arrest him
but i am not ready to prot ect a savage who raped my mother
Being her husband he could at least take revenge on two brut es
Being her son i will take revenge on the th i rd
how could a responsi ble officer like you tal k like that
a true police officer loves his duty more than his relations
you know this very well
yes si r
i know it
but being a police officer doesn't mean that

i forget the atrocities done to a mother who bore me in her wom b
do i forget the e x cesses done to my in nocent father in the name of law
he was nothing to me yet he loved me more than one loves a son
i got both a f arther and mother's love
what did i give him in return betrayal in the name of duty
C h i ld ren consig n their deceased parents to the holy fire
by arresting him i set his love afire in his own life time
i can not agon iz e myself by being so daft as to prot ect law
to def ame the whole department d ue to one man's f a u it is not right
when one mentions lnd ia one tal ks of Gandhi not Godse
i am not saying a police officer should be heartless or emotion less
but they should use their heart and emotion for benefitof the public
and not be revengeful to the public
Ashoka's pi i lar is our national sym bol
and the pride to wear this sym bol on one's head belongs only to a soldier or a police man who prot ects law
Ev en the president and the pri me m in ist er do not have this privi lege
do not d isown this pride with this resig nation
Th in k itover once more and then make a decision
i f eel ashamed to call myself your son
i could not wi pe of the blem ish against your name
Perhaps you are i i l fated to have a son like me
it is you good fortu ne that you got a husband who loved you so much
i am proud of my father
i f eel a lotof pride for him
but i have to abide by my duty
Forgive me mother i have to abide by my duty
a man can share his happiness with anyone
but his sorrow he has to contain in his own heart
that is the reason i have never told you the truth
S ince i did not want to share my agony with you
it is good that you came here today today it is your mother's an n iv ersary
Lets pray so that her sou i may rest in peace
Come one lets pray first
we can d iscuss things later
Take this and i ig ht it
the prayer is important not the way you do it
i have reached the end of my life's road
Neither do lneed anyone's hel p nor good wishes
but your son has his whole life ahead of him
therefore you save all your good wishes for him
He' i lneed them
Look at this
it must look like 6 from there
but from here it appears 9 to me
Diff erence is because you look at it from your place i from m ine
we are right in our different situations
J ust that we have different viewpoints
this d iff erence between us would last all our lives
you do what you th in k is your duty
and i will do what ev er i th in k is right
lf i win you will be proud of your father
ln case you win i will too be proud of my son
but
but my sou i won't rest in peace
but son i know this won't happen
not because you are my father
but as a police officer too l bel iev e you are right in a way
therefore i am ready to get the last criminal convict ed
the law that allowed those criminals to roam free tillnow
that law tal ks about convicting them today
i am sorry but these things have no mean ing for me
Henceforth my son you need not bother the trou ble
i will decide his conviction myself
Being a police officer i can not let a criminal wal k away
S u rrender yourself to me
a man with courage dares to cat ch his fish in a storm in the ocean
the one who sits at the shore and dang les the hook one who waits for the fish to take the bait is not a brav e man
lf you are really brav e then come and arrest me at my den
and if you are not then i am not going to su rrender myself
i am leaving
you can shoot me in the back and win rewards and f ame
a police officer can shoot any where to nab a criminal
it is not important which partof a criminal's body he shoots at
never e xpect me to be len ient to you
a criminal can even m u rder to save his skin from the police
you should n't e xpect any pity from him
i can kill you if i want
but the mother who bore you in womb for nine months is lying here
i do not want to kill you here
but remember your mother can not be everywhere to save you
Hai i brav e leader Mr C hatu rv ed i Hai i the warrior C hatu rv ed i
Forget the old things and remember that you are a police officer
Welcome
Welcome
Your life is in danger
Look at this
what is this
Why are you showing it to him
Fool
lf my life is in danger than who organ iz ed this welcome prog ram
Sir this is the time you can pro v e your courage
Al i arrangements for secu rity are in place
do not worry
David came to your headq uart er and killed an S P and you did nothing
how could you ev er save me
i am off to America
lf you go party's prestige will be soi led
Tong ues will wag leader
i do not even belong to this country
i am off
there is nothing to be afraid of
we have a bu i let proof jack et for you
that jack et would save me till here what if he shoots me here

People are hai i ing you and you are leaving i am off
Stop leader i say i will leave
Stop the Jeep
Get away
Get away
Get away

he won't get away
you can go home in police jeep
no
no
Ti i l he is not arrest ed i won't budge from here
Tell your people to cover me up
Come h u rry up
i am tell ing you as an e xperienced police officer i suggest do not go before him and endanger your life
J ust shut up
i want him to use up his bu i lets
that is why i go
you th in k j ust like me
you can not get away
i say j ut stop
do not force me
may god hel p your sou i to rest in peace
Wel i done
i have no words to praise you
my secretary told me j ust now that this killer is your father
you did not get carried away with emotions and did your duty well
what do you say DlG am i right
i will recommend a gold medal for you
Brothers and sisters this David who lies dead here was a killer and a dangerous criminal
he was a blot against the name of the country
the way we celebrat e Ravan's slaying by lord Rama as Dussehra we will celebrate this demons death
and
lf i win you would be proud of your fathercan not do it not tonight
what a pussy
Just go
Easier said than done
you are useless
Forget it
i do not
i can not
if it is so easy why do not you go
you think i would not
i am helping you bro
Fine
i am a loser you are cool OK
These chicks can not even compare to her
you are so lame
Your chick doesn't even like you
the left one is cute
Seems nice huh
do not be fooled by appearances
what should i say
Let the master teach you
Excuse me
for you
what
Call your mom and tell her you are going home with me tonight
you sleaze
this is me
but not the real me
i had a feeling she was going to do that
Sun Zi's advice is usually full of shit
Makes me wonder if i have forgotten how to pick up girls
How'd it go
Hey your face is all red
Did you get her number
no
she is not my type
Like i said nice girls are the easiest
yeah she was real nice
Forget her
we will find you another one
i can not remember when my friends made it their goal to hook me up with girls
i never asked them to
i already met my target
Morning
Good morning sir can i help you
Sorry i slept in
Customers get here earlier than you
Why be bosses if we can not come anytime
Thanks for coming
you have to BE here to be a boss
i am sick of opening you open all next week
Fine
do not cry
any new stuff
one Qing dynasty teapot and one pair of underwear
whose is it
some actor's i wrote it down
i have to go
Tell my sister to call me
do not forget to sweep
got it
this is my place
i co own it with Liang
he is allowed to scold me because he put up most of the money
we have talked of owning an antique shop since high school
it may not be that grand but how many people can say they own a shop
Funny thing is i had to leave college to run it
i was studying accounting
Why
because my dad's an accountant and so is my brother and so is my aunt's husband
that did not last too long
because what i really want to be is an author
Hey Wen Zi
do not call me Wen Zi
Your brother want you to call him
will it kill you if you did not have one
Make your call already
Out of the network area
is he still playing Counter Strike
where is your chick what is new
are not you supposed to be in class
Professor's sick
Tell me
no news
it is all good
Did you call her
what for
she is probably busy
Shooting a TV series
i guess
then call and make her day
no way
she will think i am an idiot just thinking of her all the time
but you are
how much for this clock
400
what a rip off
i will give you 250
okay okay fine 250
Take it easy
what
that piece of crap is only worth 40
i never said 400 he wanted to give it to me so why not
that is pocket change for guys like him
is that my brother's
Yup
Tell him i will call him later
what am i the answering machine
These are my closest friends
we have known each other since high school
this is Haitao
he is a bit slow but a great guitar player
Recently formed his 3rd band
this is San
he is the assistant of the guy who records sound for TV shows
a champion bullshitter and useless when it comes to giving opinions
this is my partner Liang
his dream is to be a major antique dealer
i told him if he ever makes it big
I'd be his assistant
but he said i am only qualified to hold the pen
what a punk
Keep it down
this bundle of joy is Liang's girlfriend Lin
we do not get along too well
this is Jing my closest high school classmate
Studying graphic design now one of the guys
though years ago San had a crush on her for 2 days
he tried to kiss her only to get his ass kicked
you all suck
Hurry up pay up
Did you call that girl
no
you two get it on yet or what
i called earlier but it was busy
i told you guys she is in Shanghai i will
Seriously i would have had her that night
Keep talking through your asses she is not that kind of girl
what is wrong with him
no idea
since he and Wu broke up he is acting dumber than a schoolboy
oh come on
i just met her a few months ago
Why who is going to school
i thought he was going to score that night
if I'd known this fool was
i told you guys she is different
what
you mean our comrade Wen is about to give up the single life
this punk's fallen for her bad
you just figured that out
he is serious
yeah
they were right
i did not want to admit it but i fell for her the very first time we met
my buddy texted me a funny joke
it is about two cows so like
one day so this cow got kidnapped
Hey i know her
this is Rong this is my boy Wen
this is dude what was your name
Leo DiCaprio
Really
are you an actress
Trying
you
i sell antiques
Really that is cool
he is also a novelist
Unpublished
Alright now you have been introduced take her home
Sorry
so sorry
you cracked my butt in half
Butts are in halves to begin with
and like that i fell for her
she had a special something and sense of humor
if that were some other girl she'd have
how come you are out by yourself
i was supposed to meet some friends but they canceled at the last minute
you sure they just do not like you
how do you know San
i do not know him that well
i think he was crew member on a show i was in
which show
i guarantee you have never seen me on TV
Take my recent one i was a kung fu warrior
i flew from left to right and got killed on landing
not doing so well these days
what kind of stories do you write
me
i will tell you next time so i will have something to talk about
how do you know i will see you again
because baby you and i
i can not think of anything clever
I'd like to see you again
can i have your number
much better be natural girls hate it when guys try and impress
Thanks for the tip
what is your number
1362220069
Why
you are not suggesting i wait for your call
do not blame me if you lose your phone
there you guys are
what are you doing
you guys are a walking accident
she meant you
so with that the night got abruptly flushed down the toilet
Sweet dreams
but that is okay i called her 2 days later standard wait time under int'I rules and asked her out to dinner
Notice how you can not look cool no matter how tough a guy you are if you drink through a straw
Imagine Schwarzenegger big guy sipping through a straw
looks like an idiot
It'd help if you did not have this
so tell me what kind of stories do you write
Horror stories
what like ghost stories
no well sort of
Stories that send a chill down the spine
Nobody writes really scary books these days
you know
when i read a really good book it is like the author is right there in the room talking to me
that is why i do not like reading good books
then you will probably like mine
any success with publishers
i have some connections
Good luck
here is to fame and fortune
Why you want a piece of it
Sure
least you are honest
Actually i hope when i die people will say
that talented punk owed me tons of cash
you are so weird
i haven't had this much fun with a guy in a long time
me too i mean with a girl
do not know maybe i meet a lot of idiots
yeah me too
Wonder if they know each other
when are you coming back
not sure
this time it is a bigger role
i also have a photo shoot so it might be more than a month
how should i pass these 4 weeks of boredom
do not think of me go write your book
Right
Buy a flower for your girlfriend
no thanks cutie
Hey
the balloons
Looks pretty
it is like that children's picture book
Mysterious Balloons
yeah i remember reading that
you do
i just made it up
yeah
so did i
Even though i knew I'd miss her
i was going to be fine
since meeting her my life has felt complete
i had finally found the girl of my dreams
Nonsense
no such thing
as what
Dream girl
i am not saying she is perfect plenty of prettier girls than her
Just that she is right for me
i like her
besides was not Mom yours
Dream girl she was not
but i was not wrong about her
you kids these days just because you pitch a tent in your pants you think you are in love
what a joke
Forget it
how is the book
Still writing it
Excuse me do you have the time
what are you doing
Get back
Miss stay there
what is wrong
do not be afraid
These people faceless with knives
what are you talking about
there is no one else here
i will call you a taxi
you are one of them
i told you she was a smart one
is that all
not bad
Wait
Tell me the truth
Really i liked it
Really
what do the faceless people represent
are they a metaphor for your own psyche
can not tell you yet but you will know when it is done
Why would she run to the front desk
if it was me i would not do that
Well because she
also why would she ask for the time
Libraries have clocks everywhere
Good point
Pretty scary though you have improved
i felt like i was there
Thanks
must hurry up and finish it a publisher is interested
i wonder if she will call
Nope
she is supposed to be back today
she is waiting for you to call her dummy
i do not know when she arrives
you are afraid she is just stepping on or off the plane and you will seem like an obsessed freak
Exactly
i will tell you a secret so do not go blabbing
oh come on
i have never
yeah yeah fine
do you know why i like her
i thought it was some big dark secret
um gee let me guess she is a babe
Babes are a dime a dozen
it is not that
it is because she corresponds to the List
since i was 17 i have had a list
do not look at me like that
i have actually got it at home
a list of ideal qualities i want in a woman
36 24 36
Aside from the obvious
for example her fun personality her sense of humor she doesn't always expect me to pay she is not full of herself sometimes she is just as weird as me we can talk about nothing and still have fun she is smart unlike a lot of actors and she likes kids among other things
you have ticked off the whole list in that short amount of time
what makes you so perfect to demand all that
i did not i am saying that is what i want and so far i have found it in her
Kids
how does she like kids
does she have one
what are you looking for a wife now
no well what do you mean
is not that where all relationships should end up
i am not getting any younger
i support you
if you need any girl advice ask me
can we buy art supplies after you close
Sure
i know you guys have some weird crap here but what the hell is that
that
is a big time movie star's costume
whose
what is it doing here
do you know Chow Yun Fat
no way
Get out of here
Really
Yup that is Chow Yun Fat's underwear
it is her
hi
yes
when did you get back
last night
i thought no not busy really
you know at the store
Sure
Ok
no problem
See you in an hour
Told you she'd call me
i need a favor buddy
i have to go home
Take care of the shop for me
Please
i will be your slave in my next life
when in love friends do not matter huh
Yup i know sorry
i promise we will go shopping another day
Ok
we will see
Get out of here
you suck at this game
one call and you go running
Give me your hand
this is our secret handshake
do not teach anyone else
Promise i will take you
Good luck lover boy
Calm down buddy boy
must calm down
though excited to see her
i remind myself not to over do it
she will think i am a retard
every game has rules and stages even this game of love
i sense i have entered Stage one where you analyze every move the girl makes
i can tell she is happy to see me
did not hug me but that is ok she doesn't want to look like a flirt
but she could not resist touching me
a definite sign of affection
i have missed you
yeah
me too
yeah
she said'me too'
how was Shanghai
Exhausting
have one more week here
how is business
Hey anyone buy the underwear
which no not yet
you look beautiful today
Really
Thanks
i love you
Finally
what took you so long
what do you think
Good
which one's better
that one
Why do you want to be an actress
Fame and money
Very materialistic
i am kidding dummy
how much do you think actors like me get paid
i do not know
Trust me not much
so much i have to model for stupid products like breast enhancement cream
can i judge the results
Too many kids here
Let's get dinner i am starving
Sure let's go
you are a fun guy Wen
how come you do not have a girlfriend
my last one felt i was too fun
Seriously what happened
we have finally arrived at Stage two
where we ask personal questions
it did not work out
Just not compatible
do you believe in love at first sight
i do now with you
Quit joking seriously
you baby
with who
with you baby
Come on tell me
i am saying you
i believe in love at first sight but i also think it is up to destiny
i think everyone can find the right one for them
if fate wants them to be together it happens
yes
that is what all women say
now is where i should tell her my true feelings
she is opened the door and it is now or never
Hey it is you
who is this punk
Long time no see
yeah
Da Ming this is my friend Chen Wen
Wen is an international antique dealer
Wow big business
Wen he is asked me to have dinner
i need to talk about some things with him
so i have to go
i am really sorry
oh okay
so
i had a great time today
Thanks
no problem
i hate it when i do that
Walk into a room and forget why
Bet that is how pets spend their whole lives
one thing is for sure
i won't call her
she said she'd call me
besides I'd violate a major rule
do not call the girl the same night after hanging out all day
Keep the change
Closing soon
hi Rong
hello
can you hear me
hello
who is this
it is me
who
me
who is this
it is me Chen Wen
you are signal is bad
oh
hi
i frantically try and think of something intelligent to say but the best i can do is
uh hey was that guy your boyfriend
no
he is a friend
i must go call you later
Right
okay
is he your boyfriend what a dumb ass
no she said she was busy
she was boning the guy
Really
you are a genius
then why did she answer the phone
you suck
Wen i do not want to be an asshole but a chick out by herself so late
Sun Zi that is not even his real name
in fact none of us know his name
he is the type you hang with at bars
not even sure what he actually does heard he runs a DVD distribution ring
Only hangs with us when he wants free drinks
but do not sweat it bro
at this stage you have to do something outrageously romantic
if you keep going the way you are you will end up being girlfriends
that guy might've been her boyfriend
who gives a shit
Tell him to piss off
Women like it when guys fight over them
i know she likes me i can tell from the details
Like when we eat and my cup is empty she fills it up right away
Real caring like
first class waitress
are you a first grader
the girl next to you in class picks up your pencil and you think she likes you
are you for real
i will think of something cool to do
i am the master of cool things
i am out of here bro
Alright man hey got any new discs
could not find Scream 4 new Stephen Chow movie is bad quality
here John Woo's Face off
Seen that a million times it is old
Special edition a classic
Go watch it again
can you lend bro another 500
you two hurry up 10 minutes
who is that
Looking for you Rong
what are you doing
for you
Open it
are you out of your mind
Open it first
what is this
what are you doing
instead of some cliche which we are not
i got you something you will never forget
one day you will be thinking about it but it will be gone
Like my feelings for you it will only exist inside you
Very sweet thanks but i can not take it
you are refusing a candy ring
Good thing i did not get the gold one
we are leaving soon
i have to get ready
most girls would have been touched
Well i am not most girls
you think because you pulled a cute stunt
i should gush all over you
Grow up i am not that kind of girl
what
i am trying to express my true feelings not trying to get you into bed
i am not in the mood for your jokes today
what is wrong
that time of the month
yes i am on my period
you want to say it louder
Maybe the janitor did not hear you
Later
Fine
do not say i did not try
you call this trying
she is testing me
but i am not going to turn around first
that is so unfair
it is like women are born knowing the guy will turn back first
who was that
so romantic
i will take him if you do not want him
if i were a girl
i would have fallen in love with me
another thing is for certain that is the last time i listen to Sun Zi's bullshit advice
i sought refuge in the company of friends to forget my situation with Rong for a while
Only trouble was i had to listen to their unasked opinions on the subject
Your problem is you have no persistence
you want everything now
Frankly you just do not understand women
Your few seconds of charm might fool little girls
but knowing you give up and try again in your next life
how about this one
do not like the color
sometimes you can not make someone love you
all you can do is be someone who is worth loving
the rest is up to them
what
What'd you expect
an angel
she is an actress boy
Take whatever chicks say as important as a fart
no means yes
i do not love you means i do
i do not want means i want
God damn it can not you shoot
Women are lame
Women are lame you are lame too
why is this fool always late
this guy is half Chinese
he is the bass player in Haitao's new band
his day job is teaching corporate English
which face did you take off today
26 minutes late
Casing did not fit right
do not blame me traffic sucked
this is Ian this is my buddy Liang
hi
Pleasure
Your Chinese is pretty good
so is yours
Sure he is a foreigner
Joint venture product
we hadn't gone to the mountains in a long time
We'd talked about leaving the city just us
now that Liang had finally bought a car
are we there yet
Almost
Hurry up man
you lost
no way
Hurry up
the electric donkey is faster
Step on it
i will be back for dinner just wait
Tasty
not bad
that is why you are here to barbeque
it was great being away from the city
we joked about all kinds of things
but when you throw a bunch of guys together one topic is sure to come up women
Unfortunately once again it was about
do not hang out with her anymore
she will wonder why you are ignoring her
Wait for her to make a move
for some reason chicks these days do that
Right
Pay too much attention and they disappear but when they miss the attention they always come back that is a basic rule
that is what i have i am not even bothering
she is playing games
first one to confess their love loses she is got you by the balls now
Unless you get her jealous
Bet she will then start chasing you then
the plan was to get Rong to think i had a life without her
have her see me with another girl
Let's just say it was an experiment on behalf of all the guys on the planet
the first step was to get a girl to cooperate
where would i find such a girl
Jing was not a bad looking girl
she was the best choice i had
it took some pleading but she finally agreed
Fine
but you pay for the clothes
Fine
no big deal
Ok
Promise
Just be careful not to really fall for me
what
San got a buddy to call Rong to pick up her photos for a possible commercial
it was a perfect cover story people are always asking for photos in that business
Even Ian got involved
he claimed he could borrow a Porsche
but the best he got was his cousin's VW
after all i had to look good like there is more to me than meets the eye
what
where is Jing
Ha Ha
Retard
what happened you actually look pretty
Screw you
if you want to back out
we can forget about the whole thing
no let's go
it is dumb but we have got nothing better to do
do i look okay
Practically a walking magazine cover
they agreed to meet in front of a motel
everything was in place all we had to do was make contact
1 2 shake hook
Right then bump
Bump this
Get in character
is that her
Get ready to get out
Hey she went inside
she is gone
what
where
i do not know
Just come here first
Get over here
Chen Wen
it is you
what are you doing
Hey
what are you doing here
i thought i saw you
Dropping something off
Let's go baby
we are late
what
oh
Ok
i am coming
Sorry i am in a hurry
oh okay
You'd better go then
Right
Call when you are free
you are a genius
you should be the actress even i believed it
Save the ass kissing for later
you think it worked
Definitely
she looked over here twice
so that is your dream girl huh
Feedback
she is pretty
i will admit even though later i thought the whole incident was pretty stupid but seeing her reaction proved
i still had a place in her heart
besides like Jing said we did not have anything better to do
Careful with that TV set
Wen what is all this
they needed an antique shop for an episode so San asked if he could borrow it
are you getting more stupid
how are we supposed to do business
Did they pay a fee
no
but San said he will put us in the show
you are joking right
it is my big chance
they are letting me be the boom guy
if i do well i get the rest of the series
it will only take an hour
Free publicity for the shop
Make sure they do not lose our things
where
where
Move
this is the head director this is the associate director this is the assistant director this is the director's assistant
Listen
in a moment you two stand behind the counter and look busy
at this point our main star there you are
what do you mean look busy
what is an associate director
okay
Ready hurry up
Roll tape 5 4 3 2 1 action
i do not want to discuss it
but you promised you'd handle it
Sister
what are you doing here
you heartless bitch
Cut
Excellent
how is that
not bad huh
Great
no wonder they call you one Take Liu
that is right
if i get famous i am opening a restaurant
if i get famous i will buy a publisher
if i get famous i am ignoring you two
See that girl there
she is the new script girl
she is been staring at me all day
she wants me
Make a move bro
no way i got to look like i am not interested
yeah that way she won't ever know who you are
Go over and talk
Forget her
not interested
she looks like a bitch
Bullshit
you just talk big
you have all got endless advice but none of you ever follow it yourselves
what about you
can not even score with that dumb chick you have to resort to stupid tricks
you are one to talk
what
oh and your girl
i introduced her to you
i have a feeling she will call today
but as the phone tricked me all morning
i realized women know how to mess with a guy's mind and his confidence
Granted she could be busy
Acting is tough i know i have tried it
but i think Rong really wants to call me she is just waiting for me to give in
Bet she is out there right now alone and waiting for the phone to ring
Hey girl
i am a weak bastard
can not hear you
where are you
Photo shoot
what is up
what are you doing tonight
nothing planned
it is too noisy
i will call you later
you need to get a new line you always say that but you never call
no i do not
i will call promise
do not make me wait all day
i won't
Hey who was that girl with you the other day
which one
oh her
she was just a friend
yeah
i thought some rich girl got her hooks into you
Call you later
this game is not over
she wants me big time
Just from her voice i know i am back on track
Remember the script girl
this is my new girlfriend Liu Na
hi everyone
These are my best friends
Thanks brother you were right about her
what are you fools doing here
Just about to ask you the same
Checking out the scenery bro

i already told her you are just a friend
i love you guys
Autograph

you guys were pretty good
Give us a call sometime we can jam
Right
Sign one for my little sister
Take it easy
Let me introduce everyone

Things were going well
everyone liked her and she liked my friends
and for a moment it felt like she was mine
do you like it
Just bought it today
i really like black
yeah it looks great
i love black too
Hold on
i am getting a Bud
you
Sure
i will have a Bud too
you hate Budweiser you drink Heineken
Nice car is it yours

how come as soon as i come they all leave
you wearing fake perfume
How'd you know
there is something i want to say
oh wait a sec
a present for the big writer
it is really nice
Thanks
i just wanted to apologize for that day it had nothing to do with you
which day
Forget about it
this is where i say
i love you Rong
i want to be with you
i need to wake up early tomorrow
it is only midnight
some other time
Say bye to your friends
Let's talk tomorrow
Rong
you forgot something
what
me
i like you
i like you too
i am in love with you
i have been for a long time and not because you just gave me a pen
you have given me something more valuable
Wen we are friends
Exactly
because we are friends
i want to take it to the next level
we have to hate each other to be in love
you are everything i have ever wanted in a girl you could be taller but i still want to be with you
i am only going to be gone for a night
i will see you tomorrow
that is it
Did i miss something
Maybe she is got a boyfriend
yeah some sugar daddy
Maybe she just doesn't like you
you win some you lose some
Shit you guys still talking about this
Wen Zi if it is meant to be it will be
what is this you all watch the same cheesy soap opera and memorize the dialogue
i am fine
you all seem more concerned than me
since when did this become the topic of choice
since we realized your IQ is equal to the number of times Haitao's gotten laid
Wow he is pretty smart
Let's go
you okay
i will take you home
you did not have to an ass kisser with her
do not start changing for some girl
it is not worth it
Sir
Please pay the bill
if you ever see that chick again
last chance buddy
next time you are with her just get it on with her first chance you get
you okay
yes
Why do not you go for Jing
she is cute
no way
she is my buddy
Known her forever practically a sister
you drunk
Probably
i am going home with this honey now
in your dreams
not like this you are not
Drop me off at my place
Win some lose some right
Well i must have won Rong back
the strangest thing
she suddenly invited me to go to her place
Maybe she finally came to her senses
you sure this is your house
Come in
do not worry leave your shoes on
Nice place
it is okay huh
Breast cream ads pay well hook me up with that gig
Sure
i am going to go change
have a seat i will be out in a moment
Happy birthday
i do not know if anything this horrifying has ever happened to anyone else
this is beyond embarrassment
at this moment
i want to vanish from the face of the earth
how does one get out of this situation
my old man never taught me
not another damn word
i am not joking not a word to anyone
Especially you San
do not go telling your stupid TV buddies about this shit
Man i
i mean it
Why did not you tell me
it was a surprise party
it is no big deal
no big that was the most humiliating thing that is ever happened to me
oh come on she had a good laugh too i am
it is definitely over now
to her i am just a stupid horny bastard
we could have finished the cake
Wen
Listen
it is okay
Call her and apologize make a joke then put it behind you
at least you had your underwear on
otherwise she'd have to go look for a magnifying glass
she did not call the next day
without Rong
i intend to lead a productive bachelor life
i am content
i remind myself being single has advantages
i only have one person to please
i can do whatever i want
Hang with the boys and go home anytime
do not have to worry about where she is no jealous suspicions no arguments no mind games
without a girl to worry about
i can get on with my writing career and not waste time with trivial things
but other times i feel lonely
to make matters worse it is like the world knows i am a loser with no girl and decides to rub it in my face
because everywhere i look there are couples hugging and kissing making me want to throw up
Stage three
where you and your girl are not talking for whatever reason
Lately it seems like i have been stuck in this stage
we haven't talked since my birthday
Whatever
Forget her if she doesn't like me her loss
Looks like you are having a bad time
not doing too well
Just because she saw you in your dirty undies
it is got nothing to do with that
i just do not get it
what is wrong with me
i am not a bad person
she likes being with me
she knows i love her
i am doing all the right things and playing along with the rules of the game
so why doesn't she feel the way i do for her
Screw the rules and mind games
do what is natural and follow your heart
Love and relationships are not a science that is the beauty of it
Plus destiny plays a big part i think
what would you know
you do not even have a face
that is because i am a figment of your stupid imagination
Hey sonny end of the line
that is awesome
what do you think
Pretty good huh
Yours is better
we usually ignore him
Let's go
where
i promised I'd take you shopping right
now
yes
See you in class
is that guy after you
yeah i think so
you like him
he is a nice guy
Doesn't seem like your type
yeah
what is my type
i do not know
someone with more muscle not such a wimp
it is that new look young guys these days
look more girly than most women
Calm down i am not marrying the guy
Just toying with him like all girls do right
i am not Rong
i am sorry
i did not mean that
do not get mad
i am over Rong
Whatever
one call and you will be crawling back to her
not me
do not talk to me about her anymore
Guess a riddle
what is long and hard after vigorous activity in a hole
chewing gum
for you honey bunny
Life is full of surprises
she called and suggested we make dinner
i could not refuse
we are friends
i like it like this
us two sitting together
Just sitting
yeah beats just standing
i hope you know i haven't been ignoring you
i really have been busy
i know
me too
you are great
do not think i do not like you
i do like you
it is just i want us to be lifelong friends
i did not mean
i just thought
it is not that i do not
i want us to remain friends and when two people
we are friends
Truth is i tried telling myself to forget you
but i can not
you turned my world upside down
it took me a while to realize some people are worth it
no matter what
my dream girl finally stepped out of my dreams
Life could not be much better
Just checking to see if he read it or not
no problem
my phone is always on
Nice weather today
how is business
i spent the whole day
looking for the perfect gift
i know she will like it
it is what she is always wanted
Thanks
Wen
Wait
this is for you
Hope you like it
Wait we need to talk
i misunderstood our relationship
it is okay do not worry
i want to tell you that
i am so stupid
Looks like we are looking for different things in life
i forgot i am not a rich guy
Damn you Wen
you have no right
you and i are just friends
i just want to be happy in life
it is hard enough as it is
what is so wrong with that
you are right
Absolutely right
there is no other purpose in life
None
Right
Good
Hope you're'happy' with him
is everything okay
what did he want
i do not know him well
i just want to be happy
do not think of me
she is not that type
i hope you make it
Want a piece of it
of course
never said that about other girls
i am not most girls
you expect an angel
Tell you a secret
oh come on
Fame and money
so materialistic
Wow big business
do not think i do not like you i do
my dream girl
Your dream girl
Win some lose some
Dream lover
Sugar daddy
Maybe she just doesn't like you
we should just kick that guy's ass
Asshole so what if he drives a Benz
Get a big pipe and beat him up
then puncture his tires then kick the doors
Want help
i will round up a few guys
how old are we again
Get me a beer
my foot's numb
Chicks are bitches man bitches
it is not your fault
Wrong
nothing you do is right
Guys are always wrong did not you know that
that is why i have backup girls
she starts getting bitchy i drop her like a bad habit
how come i have never seen you with one
he is saying you
no you
Hey gramps you heading out to meet some babes
what
the neighborhood council gave me a task
to promote family planning
they want me to distribute these
Condoms
Grandpa can not you wait until they leave
Why do you have to bust it out every time my buddies come over
Need any help
Hey save me a few
a few
when you are married
i will give you the whole box
as we continued our intellectual discussion
i decided to screw it all and live free
what about love
it was on probation
i was on a rampage
i did not have time to be depressed
sometimes we'd take Jing because girls notice guys who are with a girl
my success rate was questionable
but in my defense times have changed
Girls these days are different their style has changed their behavior has changed
i did not think I'd get bored so quickly
Clubs are stupid if you think about it
they are
if you turned all the lights on and stopped the music what kind of a place would that be
i just bought a brand new car
Want a ride
what about them
i already have a wife but i think you are perfect
but have to buy me a house and a car
Even the master has his day
Hey i know that girl
do not drink anymore you will get drunk
Too late
what is wrong
she was supposed to be the different one
Why did she lie
we were good together
Hey
do not do this
she is not worth the heartache
Sleep tight
Rong
Look i read it but it is not my decision
i rewrote it again please come on
Sorry to keep you waiting
that is great
i hope you guys make it
what if your book never gets published
i will find something else to do
do not let your state of mind confuse you
how do you and Lin do it
i do not know i do not have the answer
Just take it one day at a time
Maybe she and i are destined to be together
i was hoping for Nicole Kidman but seems like Lin's my lot in life
the proposal's upstairs go get it
i do not have big business aspirations
where is your emblem
someone stole it
this bastard's done this before
Go get the cement glue
it is in Jing's room somewhere
Ask Lin to help you find it
do not forget the proposal
Did you see the proposal
Hey take your shoes off
where is the glue
you finally found it
no where is it
in the kitchen
then why did you ask me if i found it
Like you did not know
i meant her tin box
that oh yeah
what is all this
i gave her this last year i think
she is kept every piece of junk you have given her since high school
no way
Damn this panda's five years old
you are so clueless
do not you start
who knows why but she is had a crush on you all these years
oh please i think i know her better than you
yeah
what do you know
who do you think organized your birthday
Jing was busy organizing it for days
she could have held it anywhere but she knew you'd want to be with Rong so she held it at her house
did not know that did you
would you have done that for her
she just thinks of me like an older brother
nothing else
None of us expected it
i never thought San would be the first to marry
all that talk about chicks being bitches he did not even consult us just announced it
who is next you two
yeah right
i almost got married to this girl
who
what happened
she transferred to a different junior high
i missed out on a special girl once
sometimes what you want most in life is right by you the whole time and you do not even know it until it is too late
i know how that is
what the hell do you know
who
which girl
you think that is why San got married suddenly
Marriage is a big step these days you have to pick carefully
you make it sound like a shopping trip
when are you getting a boyfriend
Hurry before you get old and no one wants you
like that one over there
do not expect me to take you if no one else does
Come on it was a joke
Jing come on
i was just playing
Stop it
Real nice
what is it to you
what is your problem Wen Zi
Wen Zi
Open up
Wen Zi
Open up
i am coming
Good morning
Come in
Thanks
not mad at me
Says who
you look handsome today
not going to brush your teeth
Nice
what did the new publishers say
Like the others make more changes and shit
Did you
not in the fucking mood
can you swear a little more
it is not like you are educated or anything
Also cut down on the smoking
do not change the book if you do not want to
but finish writing already
what are you waiting for
all you do is talk
Either hurry up and live or hurry up and die
what is in there
Check out my masterpiece
a friend down south runs a top design company
i should introduce you
i am sure he will hire you
Thanks bro
it is a genuine collector's item
Why is it still here
we are waiting for a true fan to buy it
yeah right last time it was half the price
Thanks Mr Su
Call me next time you are in town
Good news
my friend loves your work
he wants you to call him if you are interested
Thanks
for what
you think i should go
Why not
i am on a roll here
they say swimming helps you lose weight
if so then why the hell are whales so fat
that is true
what kind of tea do you want
anything but a golf tee
the underwear is still here
Long time no see
yeah
hi
i have been busy
you
so so
i wanted to talk with you
about what
Go ahead
Want some tea
no thanks
i will go look at the ants outside
i saw a big billboard of you
yeah
Pretty stupid huh
it is okay
how come you disappeared
i have been here all along
Missed you
you can not do this to me
you just walk in here and what reaction do you expect
i sound like a girl
what do you want Rong
Da Ming and i broke up
i know you must hate me now and i have only just worked up the courage but i hope you can forget the past and give us the chance to be friends again
i know i have realized that
Rong i do not hate you
i forgave you long ago
but i am not the back up
i do not mean
i just hope we can be friends like before
after that Ian left a few days later
he said his visa expired
but Haitao said he was getting his MBA
Haitao did not waste any time
he began putting his 4th band together
Practicing daily for a change
San and his new bride left for Mongolia to film a 100 episode documentary
i guess that was their honeymoon
Liang's new company was formed and he set off looking for new business conquests
he left the shop to me
i heard from someone that Sun Zi got busted for DVD piracy
i do not think i will see the money he owes me
i can not recall the last time i opened this early
if only Liang were here to see me
how much is this
one hundred and oh that one
that is 80
Come on any cheaper
70 is my best price
Let me get you a bag
Thanks for coming
Where'd it go
Took it down
the joke got out of hand
it is not really Chow Yun Fat's underwear
See you
Why do not you stay in Beijing
is there a good reason to stay
i need an assistant
this is dog shit
but if i add a spaceship then you think it is cool
yes
Kids love that stuff
Well i am not going to
i made all the changes you suggested but you still do not like it
i wrote this story not you
not everyone likes the same things
Sorry but i am late
Jing
i thought you forgot
i promised I'd send you off
how long are you planning to be there
do not know
we will see how the job goes
yeah
you be careful there
Hey what did they say
that same as the rest
Said my book was dog shit
Literally said it
i have seriously been wondering maybe it is time to change careers
Forget them i still like your writing
my only fan for all these years
do not give up Wen
you have talent and you know it
Your books will be on every shelf soon
but i think you are worth more than those scary stories
you should write something real something from your heart
you have always been there for me
i have gotten so used to you
it is going to be strange without you around
Hey how come after all these years we never got together
you take care of yourself okay
do not let those southerners take advantage of you
any problems you call me
i will fly down and kick their ass
Hey what is wrong
Come on
Come on now
i will miss you
i will miss you too
i promise to call often we can still joke around on the phone
i turned your jacket into a towel
Go ahead wipe away
i have to go
Trains do not wait for people
Trains go away but do not they end up coming back
Take care
do not eat the food on the train
Jing
Wait
one more time
Nice one
there is no such thing as the dream girl
but even if she exists maybe what we long for in our dreams is not necessarily what is right for us
i am sure there is someone out there who is right for me
when i think of what happened with Rong and me
two things remain unclear
what she did in her free time is a mystery why she came over that night is a mystery
if life were a fairy tale
I'd have a perfect ending
but this is life
what do i expect
the next person who walks in to be the one
Xiao Mi
Hurry up
there is nothing in that junk shop
i am coming
you are so annoying
Just as i thought
at this point in my life
i do not presume to have figured out the secrets of love and relationships
Frankly i do not think anyone has
there is no formula for success
Time is what i have
Maybe as i get older i will get better at it
but one thing's for certain
Either hurry up and live or hurry up and die
she is right
Dedicated to the one that got away

that is what we are here for
Thank you Mike
now you have watched the video
over and over
Come in
horn honks
Mike
the important thing is to be clear
and direct
but to do it lovingly
we are not accusing we are supporting
i think i hear the car
uh oh
here they come
Surprise
what happened
is somebody dead
they are your favorite
now why do not you just come on in and sit down honey
what is going on
hi Megan
my name is Mike
Your parents and your friends want to have a conversation with you and i am here to help facilitate that dialogue
so why do not we start by sitting down and making ourselves comfortable
how would that be
now Peter would you like to start the conversation
Megan we love you
we all love you
and lately we have become concerned about certain behaviors
we are afraid you are being influenced by a way of thinking
Unnatural
do you remember the woman on TV
Honey we think you are a whispers Lesbian
huh
i myself was once a gay
now i am an ex gay Megan
i work for a place called True Directions who help people like yourself to learn to understand the reasons behind homosexual tendencies and how to heal them
what tendencies
Why would you think i am a
you have been trying to make us eat this tofu
in diet watch for a switch to vegetarianism
you do not have any pictures of guys in your locker just these
Mm hmm
and these
Sexual even vaginal motifs in artwork and decorating
Gay iconography
you do not even like to kiss me
it is true
i can not believe this
Denial is a normal part of the healing process that we will explore at True Directions
Healing
Like rehab honey
Homosexuals Anonymous
Poodle it is only for a few months
there is no way i am going
Mother
Let's go
now
Welcome welcome welcome
i am Mary i am the founder of True Directions
and you must be Megan
yes
this is my son Rock
Mother
hi
Pleasure to meet you Megan
Looks like we got you just in time
what are you about 17
yes
Almost lost her to college
it is so much harder once they have been through all that liberal arts brainwashing
but we have saved a few
i will take her from here
Well
Come along
Mother
they seem like nice people
car starts
honks
the others arrived yesterday so why do not i catch you up
it is a two month program based on five simple steps
Why do not we concentrate on the first step
you admitting your problem
when you see a woman in a tight skirt and long beautiful legs or perhaps she is in the bathroom putting lipstick over her full lips or maybe in the locker room soaping her body rubbing her breasts you do not have any unnatural thoughts
i do not think it is unnatural
Ah ha
you see
you do not even think it is wrong
Until you admit your sickness you will wear these
you will earn the right to wear civvies once you have admitted the first step
it is a long path to righteousness Megan
and it is a battlefield of temptation out there and you are going to have to fight
Until then
I'd like you to meet one of our other soldiers
Hilary
Megan this is Hilary
she will show you around
and well you will get acquainted
okay
Rise and shine at 7 00
Breakfast at 8 00
Group therapy until lunch
now in the afternoon we have free time to do you know whatever and then we move inside for reorientating exercises
Family therapy on the weekends
you did not miss much really
oh
this is where we sleep
but there is no inappropriate behavior allowed
Inappropriate
Like swearing
no
Inappropriate like fucking
oh
you get caught in the throes of sodomy and au revoir

Why do not you start by telling us about the first time that you realized that you might be a lesbian
i am not
everyone just thinks i am
i should not even be here
that is a perfectly normal place to start
Why do not we discuss the issues in your intervention
i am a vegetarian
all
Mm hmm
i have pictures of women around
you think that is normal
Sure
i never really thought about it
have you ever had a boyfriend
yes
for two years we have been going steady
i really love him
he is smart and popular
he is got the biggest dick i have never seen
Well um have you ever had sex with him
i am a Christian
it is really easy to be a prude when you are not attracted to him is not it
he is very handsome
but does he make you hot
do you think of him at night when you
i am not perverted
i get good grades
i go to church
i am a cheerleader
i am not like all of you
everyone reads Cosmo
everyone looks at other girls
all the time
you only assume that they are thinking what you are thinking when they look
but they are not
Freemont power
Freemont pride
be aggressive
Drive drive drive
Go Freemont
i thought everybody had those thoughts
i just want to be normal
then you admit you are not normal

i can not wait to be straight

Maybe you have the wrong friends
i think we should all be supporting each other
Really princess

i noticed that we sprung another leak in the ceiling
I'd like for you to get to it tonight

sighs
electronic buzzing soft moaning
yeah
Sorry it is just me
what are you doing
AV what is it to ya
AV
what is that
Aversion therapy stupid
so what does that mean
when you have inappropriate fantasies about girls you shock yourself with this shocker
buzzes
so every time you think of them you feel that pain
that is sick
no pain no gain baby
you want to like dick
you better start training yourself
Hey is not that Graham's sock
None of your damn business
buzzing continues
Megan
you have a phone call
hello
Mother
Megan it is Mom and Dad
we know it is after lights out but we miss you so much
Father
we just wanted to know how our little poodle is doing
i am doing okay
you were right
i am a homosexual
but i will be regular soon
Father
oh that Mary is pretty good then huh
Mm hmm and Mike and all others
i am already starting step two
Father
we are so glad and after all that money
Mother
we can not wait to see you up there at graduation to have you home so we can all be together again
Father
Just remember we love you
we would do anything for our Megan to have a normal life
and if you need anything
Mother
We'd better go
now you hang in there
Stay strong
Sweet dreams
you too Daddy
See you at family therapy
i love you
and forward
Backwards and forwards and backwards
in a very clean line
you go in and you go out
and you go up and you go down
Girls is everybody paying attention here
and you go in and out and in and out and in and out
Get into every little crevice
and in and out
and you slip in and out add a little more oil and shove it in and take it out
Put some muscle into it
Shove it in and out
and shove it in and take it out
okay who wants to go down with me
Climb before you hide
then fool your pride
'Cause we will be waiting for ya
i go back to zero Henry
i see what you think you saw
when you passed me in the hall
i was
there you go you are getting over
Tap an old friend on the shoulder
Penny fines for leaving empties
Lose your mind you are just like Henry
Let's go back to zero
you are turning into a pretty young lady
now hold still
whistle blows Come on
all
Die
Die
Die
okay then who is left to report out their root
Andre
Shit Miss Mary i ain't the only one who do not got no root
Andre we do not use profanity or double negatives here at True Directions
okay who is next
Megan
Well i have really been thinking but i just can not think of anything
i think our little prom queen is too afraid to disclose
oh really
what is your root Graham
we are working on your issue not mine
you are deflecting
Actually
i think it might be a great idea for Megan to be reminded of your root Graham
my mother got married in pants
all right let's see Dolph
Too many locker room showers with the varsity team
Hilary
all girl boarding school
Sinead
i was born in France
Clayton
my mom let me play in her pumps
i like balls
Why thank you for that Jan
Joel
Traumatic breasts
so yeah
now Megan
do you see how easy it could be
you just have to dig down into those painful memories and you will find it
now Hilary
will you please come up here
Today we are going to learn one of the most wonderful things about being a heterosexual friendship
so what I'd like you all to do is to start partnering off
Find yourself a friend for the remainder of the program
all right everybody settle
now that we have all found someone what I'd like you to do is practice sometime tonight with these
it is a woman
and what else
i do not know
a mother
Women have roles
after you learn that you will stop objectifying them
Haven't you been listening to anything Mary said
Well have you
have i what
Stopped objectifying them
i am still looking for my root
must be tough when you are such a priss
Your turn
buzzing Ow
you really have to be more prepared for temptation Megan
sighs
Give it to me
i am open
Mike
Boys
do not you see how sad and pathetic you all are always wanting something you can not have
if i catch you looking at another man like that ever again you will be watching sports the whole weekend
Mary
first thing we do is we pull these tabs out
then you fold it over
Right now i have used food coloring
this way you could see it better
and if it is a boy well it
tinkles out
that is the wrong tab okay
will you please hold it still while i am doing this
you are doing it all wrong
no i am not
if you would just give it to me to do it would be fine
Mary
Girls intervene
Let's try that one more time
and i realized that when we finished swimming lessons we would change in front of each other
and that is it why i am a homo
Andre that is what kids do after swimming lessons
Change everybody does that
but i took one look at those boys and i got a you know what
coughs
i can relate to that
when i used to study with Jacob we used to touch each others legs and rub up against each other
Blowing each other after your fuckin' bar mitzvah's a little bit different than learning to dog paddle
that is totally uncalled for
Well excuse me but we are paying a lot of money here to get these kids fixed not sit around and listen to stories all day
Graham i hope you are getting a little more out of this program than that faggot over there
Mr Eaton i do not find that appropriate
no he is right it was a stupid ass root
i am never gonna know why i am a faggot
i have heard enough of this crap
and when you get back from Switzerland you'd better have this gay thing out of your system
got it
i got it
you fuck up no college no car no trust fund
i am not sitting in any room with faggots
Mary
Megan it is your turn to report out your root
i think it might be my parents
okay go with that
you know we have kinda been like this greeting card family
and then there was that one year where well Dad was unemployed and Mom had to support us
Wait a minute that was only for nine months
and then i was offered a much better job at the plant
Maybe seeing Mom kind of being the Dad maybe i maybe i got the wrong idea about the roles of men and women
Absolutely
i can not believe that you did not mention this earlier
Your father was emasculated your mother was domineering
Well not exactly
you wanted to emulate your mother
you have no respect for men because you do not respect your father
it is really not like that
Megan you have found your root
in order to start healing this festering wound
i want you to write a song
it is very therapeutic and it is good to put your feelings down
blows whistle
Free time is up in 20
that means inside
what is it
nothing
Trash
what am i contagious
what is that
i am stuck on five six seven eight
God is good
God is straight
Hey that is good
it is not supposed to be intellectual
Cheers are supposed to be simple make people feel good
Cheers make girls do stupid cartwheels orgasms make people feel good
Your parents did not stay very long
i imagine it gets uncomfortable sitting that long with a stick up your ass
i am sure they are just trying to do what is best for you
i thought it was just an act but you really are as sweet as fucking pie are not you
this is bullshit Megan
it doesn't work
you are who you are
the only trick is not getting caught
How'd you end up here
i got caught
Doing what
i had this friend and we just spent a little too much time together
what were you doing
what do you think
my step mom caught us in my room one day and sent me here
were you in love with her
does it matter
Careful
i could report you for that
Open the door
Walk in behind her
Draw back your bow
Let it remind her
no one's around
no need to fake it
she is not in love
how can she take it
Give her the time
she will know you mean it
Make up her mind
Throw in her feelings
Open the door
have her jump through it
she fell in love
how could she do it
do you know
do you buzzing moaning
whispering Resist temptations
heavy breathing
gasps
oh my God
Please do not tell
oh my God help
Shut the fuck up
you stupid little bitch
electric buzz Ahhh
Hey
what is going on in here
a little premature simulation
they were kissing
she is full of shit
Mike we were just uh
Mike
do not call my mom
Dolph i am really disappointed in you
i thought you had what it took to get out of here clean
it is time to wake Mary
Come on
Come on
Come on
Mary
Whoever started this is out of this house and the other is really in the dog house
Clayton
not me
Dolph
i can not go home
Mary
i am not interested in anybody's sob stories
i can only help those who are willing to help themselves
now who started this
someone has got to start talking
all right Clayton you little pervert
what you have got one week of solitary and if i catch you again you are out
sighs
Come on Mary
i wish i could've seen those two boys in action before Miss Thing over there went Nancy Drew on us
if that little twink woulda narked on me heads would have rolled
would you tie her to your bed and zap her to death
or are you running low on batteries
Mary
and here are our love birds taking a relaxing evening stroll together
Notice how affectionate they are
this could be you
and here is our happy couple at home
now it is important to make your man feel at ease when he comes home from a long day at work
now when it is time for lovemaking
Dan kisses Sue and touches her breasts
Women often find this sensation pleasurable
there is a dream in the back of my mind
across the tracks is where i will find my dream
Trailer trailer pretty trailer
Trailer trailer pretty trailer
Talk penny sing a dime
my Coleman stove is broke down all of the time
Neighbor neighbor call the neighbor
we will have dinner in the trailer
so do you miss your friends from home
i just can not decide who i miss more the grunting apes in the letterman jackets or the bulimic cheerl
Go ahead say it
i did not

i do not have any friends
what about you
Well i thought i did

Megan they are never gonna find about this

Come on
we could use a little fun

Let's go
Come on
Hurry up
Go go go
oh we have a nice big group tonight
Get in

we are just trying to provide you all with a balanced perspective to see that there are options
in the end it is up to you whether choose to live a
lie
Whether you want to be who you are or keep it hidden is really more what we are about
so you run like the underground homo railroad
dance music playing
Come on girls
you did not tell me you were taking me to a gay bar
where else would we go
i am gonna get you a drink
i do not drink
i refuse to accept a false solution to my problem
i resist temptation and seek to solve my problem

cheering music plays

Good night

okay just think
i already did
mine is just as good as anybody else's
i am a heterosexual
not yet honey

and do not speak out of turn
no i know i have never been gay
Jan remember you were molested
Just take a look at yourself
Everybody thinks i am this big dyke because i wear baggy pants and play softball and i am not as pretty as other girls but that doesn't make me gay
i like guys
i can not help it
i want a big fat wiener up my
Amen sister

Hey Jan
Jan
Group
i have found something very disturbing this morning
i would like to know who has been sneaking out with those smut peddling recruiters
i want names
i want to know who is involved
Fine then
Graham
what do you have to say for yourself
Why are you looking at me
because i found these under your bed
do you have anything you'd like to confess
i did not sneak out
but you know who did
no i do not but um
i did realize something about myself last night that i was too scared to admit until now
Out with it
Come on out with it
i have a crush
on Joel
it was the first time i really felt something for a guy
and it just it really proved to me the treatment's working
oh Graham
now let this show you what determination has yielded
Fruit
now i want you all to look at Graham's strength and how she worked her way through this five step program
and by the way i am very disappointed in the rest of you
and i have scheduled a meeting with each of your parents
if you can not listen to me then perhaps you will listen to them
Joel
no i did not go to the Cocksucker
i have never been to the Cocksucker
i won't
my cocksucking days are over
i am normal
Mom Dad you have to believe me i swear i did not go anywhere
you are not gonna tell your parents are you
chimes
now honey your mom and i both know that you did not have anything to do with that
that
Field trip to the Cocksucker
Field trip to the Co but if you had gone
you have to know that you would be on your own
what is that supposed to mean
Well you can not come home
we can not allow you to live an unhealthy lifestyle under our roof
so Megan if that is what you choose you are choosing to cut us out of your life
Well great
Great
now what did you want to tell us
Just that you do not have anything worry about
i have been missing Jared a lot and can not wait to see him again
oh Megan
that is wonderful
you just keep up the good work and we will be back to see you graduate
Dad

Mike
Essay topic
my root and how it prevented me from heterosexual loving
she is a ray of sunshine
my only ray of sunshine
now in order to successfully navigate the treacherous sea of temptation one must first enter a life out of homosexuality
i have never seen such a determined group
and i am passing all but one of you
Andre
Hmm

you will be removed from the program and the premises at once
i understand
and of course your parents have made it very clear that you are just not welcome home any more
so you will be left to your own devices
i mean there may be one thing that you can do where we can workout some kind of a deal
i will let you stay and graduate with the rest your class but you must do me one favor in return
Partner in simulation with Rock
Rock
i do not think that will work
dance music playing
oh for Pete's sake
singing Wham bam thank you ma'am
Rock turn it off
we have lost Megan
she just was not strong enough
but you still have a chance to save yourself
it is your choice
you can run off with Megan and turn into a raging bull dyke or you can do the simulation and graduate and lead a normal life
there is no choice
you came here to graduate and that is exactly what you are going to do
you understand me young lady
this is exactly why your mother left
are you ready to lose your father
then it is settled
Graham will partner with Rock in simulation
Megan you are out
Skedaddle
softly i am sorry
Man
what do you want
i need to talk to Lloyd and Larry
but you are from True Directions
yeah
window shuts
Hey not anymore
all right kid get in here
Come on move your tush
i can not go back
i thought you could teach me how to be a lesbian what they wear where they live
you know
Megan we can not help you with that
there is not just one way to be a lesbian
you just have to continue to be who you are
Dolph
Megan
Thank you so much for saving me from that place
what are you doing here
i live here
or at least until i find a way to make it on my own
it is way better than TD
we all get our own rooms and curfew is midnight
but we have to share bathrooms
not at the same time of course
of course
Come on it is going to be okay
no it won't
she was supposed to leave with me and she did not
Whoa slow down who
Graham
i knew it
she was into you from the start
then why did not she come with me
Maybe she was scared
Like i am not
Believe me you are better off here
Mary
Graham
Pay attention
Action Rock
now lean in and kiss her
Nice Rock
now feel how soft and vulnerable she is
is not it wonderful
now Graham
let him take the lead
a little tongue
he loves you
he wants to be with you
the way God intended
to be inside you
his love muscle thrusting
both scoff
Cut
Megan we thought that Dolph should take you out this week to celebrate your new freedom
how would that be
Sure
so Megan what do you want to do now
Larry Megan just made a very traumatic decision
and she is moving through that process
i thought that we could check out some schools in the city
and i could
she is not ready
Sweetie
i am just asking a simple question
i am not interrogating her
you are moving into that
aggressive space again
can not i even ask a question around here
now i feel you moving into your victim stance
i was not attacking i was verbalizing
i just feel like you do not value my opinion anymore
Seems like nothing i do pleases you
i feel inadequate
i love my Larry bear
Lloyd's sorry
Larry bear's sorry too
okay then
Dinner's ready
Very good
okay who is next
okay now remember that sex is fun
we are making love
there is nothing dirty about it
Sex is beautiful when it is between a man and a woman
Mom
okay now from this position the woman will spread her legs opening like a flower
that is wonderful Graham
now at this point the man will insert himself into the woman
yes that is
yes
Rock that is it
Mrs Brown
what is it Joel
what about foreplay
Foreplay is for sissies
Real men go in unload and pull out
Mom
we could dance if you want to
you go ahead
i think i need to go get some air
i miss her
she is scared that maybe she is making the wrong choice
but it is her wrong choice to make
you have to be willing to walk away
what about you and Clayton
if he can not make a stand he just can not make a stand
Well what about you
what are you willing to do
i am so proud of you
Doesn't it feel great to be straight
to be out of homosexuality
it is not always gonna be easy but at least we know what to do now
okay girls ready to go
Give me the keys
i hope she is worth it
is Clayton
i am doing this for you not for Clayton

to pay for the next expedition of course
but that is a circular argument
if the only reason for the expedition is the kiIling and Iooting and the only reason for the kiIling and Iooting is to pay for the next expedition they canceI each other out
Stop talking as if we are married
WeIl you started it
i just said i did not feeI Iike raping you
and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than aII the kiIling and Iooting
Scream
EX CLAlMS FAlNTLY
Louder
EX CLAlMS
Rape
Thanks
Rape
where
he raped me standing up
you finished then
i suppose so
Right
Leave her alone
no
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death
i did not mean to
that is aII right then
it is the thought that counts
you told them i raped you
Why
i do not know
you Iooked so vulnerable
Why should you care
Why should you care
TeII me your name
TeII me what is it
EX CLAlMS
Erik the Viking
what can you want with me Erik the Viking
i am sorry i should not have come
Afraid they wiII make fun of you for Iistening to an old woman's stories
WOMAN CHUCKLlNG
Young men only interested in fighting and kiIling
yes
but has it always been Iike that
since the beginning of time
what do you see Erik
i see the world
is it night or day Erik
Why it is day of course Freya
is it winter or summer Erik
WeIl the winter is passed
it is summer
have you ever seen the sun Erik
no it is up beyond the clouds where it always is
but have you ever seen it Erik
Think back
i remember once as a child
a dream
it was as if the whole sky were blue
it was blue Erik
the old stories teII of an age that would come such as this when Fenrir the Wolf would swaIlow the sun and a great winter would settle on the world
it was to be an ax age a sword age a storm age when brother would turn against brother and men would fight each other untiI the world was finaIly destroyed
then this is the Age of Ragnarok
is there nothing men can do
the gods are asleep Erik
i wiII go and wake them up then
TeII me what i must do
Far out in the midst of the Western Ocean there is a Iand
Men caII it Hy Brasil
there you wiII find a horn
this horn is caIled Resounding
you must take the Horn Resounding and three times you must blow it
the first note wiII take you to Asgard
the second note wiII awaken the gods
and the third note wiII bring you home
Once you are in the speII of the Horn hatred wiII destroy you
WiII the dead ever return Freya
that i cannot teII you
if you ever thought of converting my dear now would be an ideaI opportunity
not now
no of course not
but you might not get another chance
Go away
Right
I'Il
yes that is what I'II do
I'II pray for you
Let her go
Why
we haven't hit a single braid yet
he hit my wife
that showed her
what is the matter
we are missing the fun
what is it aII about Grandpa
what
we toiI and Iabor we Ioot and piIlage we rape and kiIl and yet
Why you talking this piffle son
where does it aII get us Grandpa
who you been talking to
i met this girl
Woman
it is always a woman who causes aII the trouble
she got me thinking
so
What'd you do to her
i kiIled her
LAUGHS
that is my boy
Come on Erik
Erik what are you doing
Thorfinn just said Sven's grandfather died of old age
he must fight to the death
that is right
Sven must kiII me
are not you afraid of death Thorfinn SkuIlsplitter
not death by the sword
it means i shaII drink in ValhaIla with the great warriors
you do not believe in this ValhaIla nonsense do you
Go away
Right
Fine
Just checking
and you Sven are not you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard
i wiII join my grandfather there
he is not in ValhaIla
he died of old age
you Iiar
Stop it
Stop it
there is only one way to settle it
he must kiII me
there is another way
who gets kiIled
Nobody gets kiIled
oh weIl
It'II be dangerous
Maybe none of us wiII return
ShaII we aII go and pack now
what are you talking about Erik
what if we could find Bifrost the Rainbow Bridge
Find the Rainbow Bridge
Find it and cross it
Look you can not find somewhere that doesn't exist
Shut up
Right
what is the matter
are you afraid to try
of course we are not afraid to try but
but what
but what
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard
We'd be the first
you mean we'd be dead
no
we would be the first Iiving men to set foot in the haIls of the gods
but how
i do not know
but i am not afraid to try
WeIl i am not afraid of anything
Neither am i
Wish you were going too
but you can not
Too busy
that is a good one
you could charge Halfdan 15 for that one
yes it is good is not it
but i told him 10 Loki
yes it is good is not it
but i told him 10 Loki
you charge him what you Iike
you just can not make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand
you could charge Halfdan 20 for that and he'd pay it
i could not do that
the Blacksmith's Code says that i must
yes yes of course the Blacksmith's Code
if this is the Age of Ragnarok KeiteI Blacksmith it is good to us
can not make enough swords
can not make enough ax heads
but Keitel
if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding if he ever crosses Bifrost the Rainbow Bridge if he ever wakens the gods
they chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky
the Age of Ragnarok ends and
the bottom faIls out of the sword business
it is not just your Iivelihood at stake but your son's and
WeIl the Iivelihood of aII blacksmiths
my brother blacksmiths
that is right
you just can not Iet Erik do that
what is your business
i wish to speak to Halfdan the Black
he is too busy
i have money
See
MAN SCREAMlNG
Come along Hecate
Look i am not an unreasonable man Thord Andersson but this is the second chance that i have given you
but i am a poor man sir
yes but it is not just me you see
a Iot of people depend on this money
i reaIly can not give you a third chance i am so sorry
would you behead him please
no
Take aII my sheep aII of them
that is a good idea
Take aII his sheep
WOMEN CRYlNG
Take everything
if only they'd think ahead
i reaIly wish they would
the blacksmith's assistant from Ravensfjord
Garrote him would you please
no no
my Iord Halfdan the Black
you have brought me more swords
i bring more than swords
i bring a warning from my master
a warning
no
Flay them both alive would you
no it is a mistake
Erik and the men of Ravensfjord are setting off to cross the Western Ocean
Lucky things
i could do with a holiday i could teII you
AII this financiaI work you know the stress reaIly gets you
Flay him alive garrote him and then behead him
no i am not Hildir Eysteinsson
i am Hjalti Skeggjason
you have got the wrong man
SHUSHlNG
they seek to drive Fenrir the Wolf from the sky to waken the gods and to bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end
End Ragnarok
who do they think they are
WHlMPERlNG
Just cut his hand off
oh thank you thank you my Iord
Thank you a miIlion thank yous
Perhaps you could cut them both off if you want
Thank you very much
so why should you teII me aII this
because my Iord my Iivelihood depends on Ragnarok
Like yours
and of course if anything should happen to your master you would become blacksmith of Ravensfjord
do not forget never Iet your enemy get behind you
no Mother
Keep your sword greased
yes Mother
Good bye Dad
do not forget to wash you know aII over
no Dad
and if you have to kiII somebody kiII them
do not stop to think about it
i never do
it is a tradition
i know Dad
you told me
i was a berserk for King Harald Fairhair
you went berserk
i went berserk in every battle
i ever fought for King Harald
so did your father
so did my father and his father before him
but it is a responsibility
but it is a responsibility being a berserk
i must only Iet the red rage
you must only Iet the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle
i know
i have heard it aII a thousand times
no no no no
You'II never make a berserk
if you Iet it out now you'II have nothing Ieft for battle
WeIl we'II be off now
Say something a Iittle more than that
Right
WOMAN SOBBlNG
Mom
do not be sad
Maybe untold dangers do Iie ahead of us and some of you may weII be Iooking at the ones you love for the Iast time
but do not grieve
you see even if the hordes of MuspeII tear us Iimb from Iimb or the Fire Giants burn each and every one of us to a cinder even if we are swaIlowed by the Dragon of the North Sea or if we faII off the edge of the world do not cry
WOMEN SOBBlNG

CARLOS MONTERO ANTlQUES OF ALL SORTS
here it is
it is a painting on a steel sheet
from the beginning ofthe 19th Century
it is dated
Look
the date doesn't mean anything Ma'am
yes
Montero Antique Store
yes
it is me
there are many forgeries in this business
this seems to be from the beginning of this century
you are completely mistaken it is authentic
what
yes yes principal
it is unbelievable
i assure you that the little rogue will be punished accordingly
yes yes Sir
Good afternoon principal
it is 300 pesos if you want it
the most i would give you is 80
no that is impossible
Well let's say 95
i will handle this
the gentleman was offering me
Leave
now
as an expert you will agree with me
you are mistaken
besides this picture is not for sale
but the lady was asking me
here we sell sir
we do not steal
Go to the flea market where it is more expensive than the stores thanks to customers like you
Come on man
with such a temper you will have very few customers my friend
what a stupid fool
Why do you even argue with those people
but Carlos
he was a customer
a customer buys he doesn't bargain
Carlos please
that telephone call upset you right
Remember getting upset is harmful for you
and who gets me upset
if it is not you it is my son
and when it is not my son it is you
so it must have been the school right
something happened to Carlitos
Tell me
if you did not spoil him so much if you did not always sidewith him this would not have happened
for God's sake what happened
Simply that at his age he has the instincts of a thief and doesn't respect his teacher
are you still going to defend him
that is all i need
how embarrassing
my son a thief
i won't accuse him without seeing him first
he is at a difficult age but he is a good kid
i will speak to him and you will see
yes
and you will cover up for him as usual because all you care about is getting your own way
there is no other authority here but yours Carlos
since we got married i have had to give up all my pleasures all my desires all my opinions
but now we are dealing with Carlitos
so you have sacrificed yourself right
before we got married it seemed that i was always right and you treated me with great respect
but of course that was before
in order to get out of your misery
to get your parents out of that rotten neighborhood they lived in
i have kept my part of the bargain
do you lack anything
you have been good to me
if you wish treat me as a maid but do not be unfair to your son
Come here Carlos
Today you have tarnished your father's name with shame
because your father is an honest man understand
i did not steal anything father
the teacher
Shut up
do not talk back to me
you should listen to him
and believe him if he tells the truth
in the meantime go to your room
you will not come out or eat until you tell me the truth
i do not want sons that lie or steal
it is not true
i am not a thief
that will teach you not to talk back to your father
Come with me
Carlos please
when you grow up you will say
my father slapped me to always remind me that i should not steal nor disobey
Come on
Get in there
Isolation and hunger are the best remedies for rebels
if it was used more often there would be fewer revolutionaries
you have to learn to behave like my son
no thank you
you are not going to eat
i am not hungry
it is your loss because the tamales are delicious
Come on eat one
i told you i did not want any
Come on
what is the matter
every day the same thing
Long faces sighs ignoring the food
do you think it is free
Look if you are going to continue sulking like this leave the table because seeing you like this makes me lose my appetite
Carlitos son are you already asleep
Listen i do believe you
i know you are good that you never lie
Carlitos
my son
where are you my boy
he ran away
Carlitos is not in the room you locked him in
what are you saying
the boy has ran away Carlos
if anything should happen to him it will be your fault
he ran away
Impossible
how could he have ran away if i locked him in
that doesn't matter now
we must do something immediately
Come on Chole perhaps we will catch him down the street
where are you going
Calm down
he could not have gone far
i will catch up to you
i am going to call the police
oh children
Children
Man that is strange
what happened Gonzalez
Look boss
i thought it was something more
since when is it strange to see a boy
this boy is not from here sir
Let's see
you are right
he is no
yes he is crying
he maybe lost
Let's go and see
Come on sir
do not run boy
we won't harm you
are you staying here or just visiting
Stay still
do not be afraid
i am your friend
Get back to work i will catch up with you later
Look you will sit here with me and tell me your name
what you won't tell me
then you are Don Juan without a tongue
Look if you become my friend i will take you to a river where you wil find the biggest trout in the world
would you like to catch one Juanito
but i do not know how to fish
no big deal
i will teach you
Right now
Right now my friend
so we are already friends right Juanito
my name is not Juanito
my name is Carlitos Montero Jimenez
so you have a name
how did you get here
on a truck
okay Carlitos
you will now tell your friend Julio because my name is Julio why you ran away from home
Well at least here it doesn't say anything
the press doesn't say anything
anyway the police has been alerted and all we can do is wait
Thank you for your concern
i will tell him
Excuse me miss
i would like to speak to the owner
my husband has not arrived
Come back later
then you are the owner
you are so young
i would not have believed it
Well Ma'am
i am sure you will love to have the piece of art i brought you
i am sorry but i can not take care of that right now
Wait a moment
my son
you are fine
are you alright
Why did you go away
where
i bet you haven't eaten anything since last night right
yes i did mother
i had breakfast with my friend Julio
Excuse me but i am so excited that i haven't even thanked you
it doesn't matter
you do not know how i have suffered these past days and when i was most desperate you show up with myson
how can i thank you for that
by drying those tears
by seeing you happy i feel well repaid
oh son how could you do it
you did not think of your mother's suffering
Sorry mommy
i swear i will never do it again ever
Carlitos
you think you behaved properly
when i was littl e and ran away from home
i returned with my tail between my legs and not smiling
i should spank you
Forgive me for leaving father but i did not steal anything
it is alright
Alright
Please forgive me son
Forgive me too but i have to leave
Carlos Mister
Julio Mistral at your service
Mr Mistral found Carlitos and brought him to us
at your service Mr Montero
no formalities
Allow me to embrace you and treat you as my best friend from now on
Julio right
yes sir
Well then Julio Carlos and Rosario
do not you think so dear
Ofcourse
without him think what could have happened to Carlitos
Ma'am i am delighted to have met you
you too Sir
i mean Carlos
and till soon i hope because i intend to become a customer
you can not leave without first having a drink
Carlos the gentleman
Keep quiet
what do you know about men's stuff
i bet you have never had a cognac like this one
Pure nectar
i thank you for your kindness but you must be anxious
to be alone with your son and
in due time my friend Julio
Rosario what do you think of inviting him to dinner to celebrate our meeting
it will be my pleasure
you heard it
Said and done
that will teach you not to go around being a do gooder
to your health
Cheers
Excellent wine right
Well if i do not say it who will
we will have coffee in the living room Rosario
Coffee with a tad of cognac
Well more than a tad
Come on in my friend Julio
Remember no formalities
as long as you do not get bored
Please do not say that
Perhaps you like fun people
the night life night clubs
you are young
i bet you are a womanizer and a gambler
Carlos please
you are speaking inappropriately to our friend
you are mistaken Don Carlos
Gambling bores me and easy women are not to my liking
i am crazy about my profession and i would like to have a family
you are a romantic
although i imagine that in the forestry business a good engineer with some political backing could get rich in no time
by the way do you smoke cigars
do not tell me you do not
you will smoke one today
i have some cigars that are delicious
i will bring them
i am taking advantage of your hospitality ma'am
i will go
no please
besides you heard my husband
a very cordial man
i am sure that behind those rough manners he hides a good heart and i believe he sees me as a friend
what i regret is that you do not
Why do you say that
i do not understand
i am under the impression that my presence here bothers you and
not at all
from thevery first moment i
Thanks to you i recovered my son and i will never forget it
i am happy to be mistaken because you seem admirable and well
here they are
you will see what great cigars these are
yes they seem excellent
the box is for you
no for God's sake that is too much
i beg you to
no no this way each time you smoke a cigar you will remember your friend Carlos
Well thank you very much
in order to try to reciprocate your hospitality
i would like you to come and spend a day with me in my woods
they are not mine but i am in love with them
i assure you that you won't be bored
it would not be a bad idea right Rosario
and where are those woods
on the highway to Toluca at kilometer 39
Man what a coincidence
Tomorrow i have to go to Toluca
i will wait on the highway around ten o'clock in the morning
Sure
you can stay with the boy in the fresh air and sun
i will continue on my way and be back in time to eat
because i am sure there will be something to eat
Ofcourse the best trout in the country
not one more word
we will be there at ten o'clock
how are you Carlitos
Ma'am
Dear friend you have British punctuality
Punctuality is my middle name
i won't tolerate informality neither my own nor that of others
can i catch a trout
one
a dozen at least
yes son fish a lot your father's stomach will thank you
Well i will leave now so i can come back sooner
do you need anything from town
no nothing
we have everything
Wine ham cheese trout
Stop otherwise i will stay
Thank you
Goodbye
so long
and let Rosario help with the cooking
she is an expert
so Iong
Mom look what a big trout
Look at my son
he is happy
it must be marvelous living here
yes especially for me since i love the solitude and the mountains
in these woods everything is pure until men and machines arrive
they destroy everything
Look at that tree it is venerably old and to think they will make tables and chairs out of it for vulgar people
by the way why is your husband taking so long
Why do you laugh
you remembered him after mentioning vulgar people
yes why should i deny it
you are so different i do not understand how you fell in love with him
Fall in love
Forgive me for being so indiscreet but i am so interested in everything about you
if you did not love him why did you marry him
i was very young
Almost a child and
I'd rather not discuss that
Mother mother
Look how many fish
they are beautiful
Why don'twe eat them now
i am hungry
it is almost three o'clock
i can not understand why he is so late
Business is business
i want to eat
Well then we will eat
we have waited long enough
Very good
Come on
he can eat alone when he returns
what is the use of loving
with all your heart
what is the use of suffering
Respecting love
for me there is only you
he fell asleep it is past his bedtime
it is almost 8 o'clock
i do not understand why Carlos is so late
does it bother you to be alone with me
do not say that
i am embarrassed about my husband's behavior
Why are you always so sad
i do not know
Perhaps it is the habit
you do not know how sorry i am to know you are unhappy
Today i have been happy for the first time in many years
this afternoon you did not answer my question
Why did you marry him
Carlos was my parents' friend
a good friend
he was very rich and we were very poor
that is crazy to condemn you to not knowing what love is
and at your age
Really i do not mind
some women do not have a husband or son
but they have love
you are a very young woman who spends her life beside a man she doesn't love and who doesn't understand her
a woman who lives a lonelier life than these woods
there is no loneliness when one has a child
that is not enough
you have never loved anyone
Rosario
Julio
where are you
Carlitos
you can not see anything in this damn place
you must be very angry with me but it was unavoidable
is there any trout left
i did not forget about that
Finally
i have been restless desperate
Why did you take so long
you can imagine
i am not free Julio
Give me your coat
i come for only a moment
Forgive me
i was so anxious to come here and you see i can not stay long
it is very late
i spent all afternoon waiting for you
Smoking like a fiend
Worrying about what might have happened to you if you weren't coming after all
i was tempted to call the store
to go for you
i do not know
Look Julio if it were up to me you know i would never be away from you
i swear that each time our goodbyes seem harder
i want to see you always
Feel you near me every minute
we can not go on like this Rosario
i do not want to share you with him anymore
do not be cruel
it is also terrible for me
you wait but you do not have to live with another woman
Nor do you have to lie to pretend or to smile forcefully
Nor hide whenever you want to cry
Forgive me my darling but i love you so much
i can not stand it any more either
this is my house
you are my world
each day i hate Carlos even more but lying is the worst part
the shame the humiliation of having to lie is just unbearable
Stop fighting it
Get divorced and marry me
i can not leave my son Julio
i have thought about it thousands of times and i can not
what if we run away together and take your son with us
we will take the road and when we are far away from here we will write Carlos telling him the truth
would you do it my darling
i want whatever you want
Listen to me then
Tomorrow at nightfall come here with Carlitos
we will immediately take a train and go to any city to prepare our trip
to Brazil where they have offered me a marvelous job
Say yes my love
yes my darling
i will go wherever you want
i want to live my love by daylight
i will be back tomorrow
Rosario
Three first class tickets to Vera Cruz
for when sir
for tonight's train
Rosario thank God you are here
it took you so long i thought you weren't coming
we have just enough time to get to the train
and the boy
what happened
Answer me
i can not go with you Julio
i came only to
what
Explain yourself for heaven's sake
we have to put our plan aside
for now at least
my husband
what
he knows something
you told him about us and he has taken the boy
no he suffered a heart attack this morning
Angina pectoris
i must return immediately
i only came to tell you
is he very ill
Rosario i will go with you in case something is needed
Let's go
Julio my Julio
my love
Calm down
we will discuss it later
Come on
Come in
as soon as i found out what happened i came to see you
my good friend
how is he doctor
Under the effect ofmedication
he needs absolute rest
not the least bit of excitement
i believe that for now he is out of danger
i will be back in an hour
in the meantime lots of rest and above all no talking
Leave the boy here
i will be at the clinic
if something happens before i come back call me immediately
he will be fine doctor
with the heart one never knows
but if your husband has no upsets or excitement he may recover soon and live for many years
so long ma'am
Thank you doctor
i wonder what triggered the attack
does he suspect anything
no
i do not believe so
he was in good spirits
if it had happened after we'd left it would have been my fault
how could you know he was sick
who would blame you
i am afraid Julio
Calm down i beg you
you heard the doctor
he will be okay
it would be a crime to leave him now
we will wait 10 15 days whatever is necessary and then nothing will break us apart
what are you thinking about
Imagine the boy did not want to come with me today
he has become very fond of his father since his sickness and my husband of him
it is natural
they are father and son
but answer the question i asked before
when are we leaving
Why do not you answer me
Why do not you even look at me Rosario
Your husband is well now the doctor has said so
he can go backto his passion eating and drinking
you do not have to feel guilty
we can go with a clear conscience
there is something you do not know
now that i see how much he and the boy love each other
i do not have the courage to take him away
Leaving could kill him and i would never forgive myself
i understand you do not love me as much as i thought
Please
if i did not love you i would not confide in you my most intimate thoughts
i talk to you as if to myself
you think i can abandon my husband and rob him of his child
Let's wait longer
there must be a way out
Away out
if i go on like this i will explode and shout out everything in your husband's presence
Bring your son or leave him but come with me
you are not the first woman in my life Rosario but you are the only one i have loved
the only one i will love until i die
the decision to come to Brazil with me or not is in your hands
Mom look
Look my little boat broke
it doesn't matter dear
i will buy you another one
for the last time Rosario yes orno
in that case
Goodbye Rosario
ANTlQUES OF ALL SORTS
UNlVERSlTY OF MEXlCO
Well what do you say now Ma'am
what can i tell you Don Feliciano
i am happy
i never thought Miguel would graduate
i am not very old but i can die in peace because both my sons are now doctors
and it is not a joke you can see how badly distributed the riches are these days
a family of doctors when there are families of sick people
Well now forget family affairs and sentimentalities
Everybody wants to drink starting with me
Doctor come on
the girls want to dance
and why are you standing there
Take care of the guests
yes i am going
Come on son
Your father is right dance and enjoy yourself
Come on
Come on
Doctor will you allow me to care for your patient
Your behavior shocks me young colleague
Professional ethics forbid a doctor from taking another doctor's patient away
i do not plan on taking her away
it is simply a consultation
Well alright i agree as long as the patient doesn't object
Well my dear colleagues even though i admire the knowledge of Dr Carlos my friend and teacher i still recognize
the merits of the new doctor
so you mean
in case of an appendectomy i would choose you
but when it pertains to dancing i choose our young doctor who is more of an expert
Allow me colleague
do you wish to dance ma'am
for heaven's sake son i haven't danced in a long time
Come on mother i want to teach Miguel and his partner a lesson
i want them to learn to dance the waltz properly
are you going to deny him that
Come on dance
do not drink anymore i beg you
but i drink because the doctor prescribed it woman
we are among doctors and i am sure they will approve
do not you agree
and i drink to modern medicine that prescribes whiskey for the aliments of the heart and therefore i make a toast to the doctors who prescribe it
and now my friends we will have a bite to eat
Carlos Miguel come upstairs your father has something to tell you
Boys i want to tell you something that will interest you
i have been doing some inquiring and it seems that a clinic is a great business right
that is for sure
Why do you say that
i am not rich but i am on the verge of closing a good business deal selling a few lots of land
and i thought that instead of putting the money under the mattress it would be a good idea to invest it in a clinic
that is a marvelous idea father
can you imagine Miguel a clinic
our dream
everything sounds nice but is it a good business or not
because you know i do not
of course father
if you manage it well
Carlos would be the director and i the assistant
and we could also have a research laboratory
yes son
i have also dreamed of having you both settled and when your father had that idea i was overjoyed
Well things being what they are it was her idea
and she bothered me so much she convinced me
you are a wonderful mother the most beautiful
and as good as no other
Well be quiet
Well so that is it
Go find a house but remember you have to pay me back
Ah yes
Why didn'tyou tell us before
it is beautiful son
Beautiful
i find it ideal very cheerful for a clinic
a place like this and nobody will doubt we are good doctors right
Nevertheless i think the rent is too high
i will speak with your father who knows a lot about this and you will see how he gets a good deal
i think it is a steal
and by means of a long term loan for which i will soon apply we will be able to install the most modern x ray equipment
but that costs a lot of money
they are not inexpensive but here the clientele is very rich
Let's see my office
yes son
how would you like this office for yourself
i love it as i love all your projects
i am so anxious for you to make money so we can so you can dedicate yourself to your research
if you really want me to be successful why not
Why not what
i do not know how to say it
but instead of being chief of nutrition why don'tyou become the owner ofthis house
with directorand all
do not you like the idea
i like it and i am touched Carlos
you have been my colleague my teacher but i do not know
Right now it would be impossible to think about that
Why change friendship for love
do not make that face
Perhaps i should not give an answer yet
Why do not we leave it pending for some time
if you wish but you are for me above all a woman not a doctor
not a colleague not even a pupil as you claim
i will wait all the time necessary
now let's talk about something else
Tomorrow you will come with me to the hospital
i will show you the new installation ofthe bacteriological lab
we have German microscopes
Good morning doctor
Am i interrupting
Rita
what areyou doing here
the same as you
Dr Manzano had also cast an eye upon this house
do you know each other
this is Dr Sunsula
the doctor is very well known
they say that her method of feeding children extends into adulthood
what is your opinion doctor
i think
as an adult the doctor thinks it is all nurses' gossip
is not it so Carlos
yes of course
See you soon little doctor
it is a pleasure to see you in such professional and nutritious company
what did she mean Carlos
have you had anything to do with that woman
Absolutely nothing
but she thinks all doctors and patients love her
what is it with you two
nothing
we were just talking
Come on mother is waiting for us
what a scoundrel
what is the matter Carlos
can you imagine him wanting to cheat me at this point but since nobody robs me i cancelled the deal
what are you saying
that thief settled for only 130 000 pesos and today the land is worth at least twice as much
but you paid much less
we just need to make some money to settle Carlos in
you do not know a thing about business
you do not
Remember when we transferred the store we almost gave it away for nothing because of your interference
Forgive me but i take back everything
you do not know how sorry i am
but father i already made a deal with the owner of the house and with the stores
no it is not definite
i have to wait to sell at a good price to an honest person
Forgive me and do not worry
everything will be solved in time
Father Mr Palafoz is on his way here
Don Nicolas Palafoz the notary public
yes him
Funny
he hasn't been in this house for years
he told me it was something urgent and important
have you heard Rosario
yes and i wonder what it could be
Well imagine
when it comes to a notary
it must involve an inheritance
we would like that but from whom
could it be from your Uncle Agustin
he would leave only debts
do not worry
i was thinking about your Cousin Juana
Sure that one is rich
Forget it
she married again and with a young man
where are you going
you can keep guessing
i am going to my room
but why
what is the matter
after today's letdown i am not in the mood for guessing games
he is right
Mr Palafoz
Come in Don Nicolas
Come in
it is been such a long time since last we saw you
what can i say Don Carlos Ma'am
at your service
how are you Don Nicolas
not so bad Doctor
i already said hello to Miguelito downstairs
Won't you sit down
and tell us what brings you here
Care for a drink
i will sit down yes Ma'am
and i will tell you Sir
and for the moment i won't drink anything
Thank you
before i start i must tell you i am here as a notary not as a friend
in said capacity i must give you bad news
what can i say it is part of the job
i have been notified by a Brazilian colleague about the death ofa friend of yours
it is about Mr Mistral
Julio Mistral
Dead
Julio Mistral the engineer
Exactly ma'am
yes sir
it happened over a month ago in Sao Paulo Brazil
who would have thought
such a kind friend so refined
i still remember how he took care ofme when i had my angina
he was so thoughtful
do you remember Rosario
i haven't forgotten
he was so fond of Carlitos
you do not remember him son
he is the man that brought you home when you ran away
yes i had not made the connection
he taught me to fish trout
i was very small
Did i know him father
Let me see no
you where born some months after he went to Brazil to do his foresting
that is so sad dear God
if you do not mind holding your thoughts for a moment that engineer Mistral left a will and if you allow me
i will begin to read it
Let's see
in the city of Sao Paulo Brazil at the date of the month etc
i Julio Mistral being of sound mind but ailing body
leave all my personal fortune that amounts to
a million one hundred thousand pesos Mexican currency
to the son of my dear friends Carlos and Rosario Montero
Miguel Montero Jimenez
one million one hundred thousand pesos to me
should the beneficiary hesitate or if his disappearance prevents him from receiving the inheritance the money will then go to the Muir foundation towards the help of the destitute etc etc
Well i will now accept that whiskey if you are so kind in order to drink to the health of the young heir
Nevertheless what i can not understand is why he remembered us after all these years
do you understand it woman
yes he adored children was very kind as it seems he had nobody had not married
but why did he leave it to me
Perhaps because you are the youngest
Your son will have to declare his acceptance formally
Ofcourse he accepts is it not so Miguelito
Tell me Don Nicolas that money is free from all
there are no debts nor any other heir that might contest
nothing nothing
it is the most simple and direct donation
i have handled
Thank you
then you accept Don Miguel
Well of course we accept
does he have to sign anything now
no
Tomorrow at 12 in my office
to your health then and congratulations
that poor Julio was a true friend
and he had a great heart
who would have thought i would have a millionaire son
how do you feel Miguelito
Frankly father a little stunned
and why are you sad
it hurts me to think he died far away from his friends
but remembering them
i have to leave but first i want to congratulate you Miguel
Thank you Carlos
where are you going son
Excuse me mother but i am on duty at the hospital
but it is very early
Won't you eat with us
i am sorry but i have a headache and would like to walk
Leave him alone
i bet he is sad about the death of his friend
See you tomorrow mother
Goodbye son
Come here Miguel
you and i are going to drink to the memory of the great friend Mistral and for your future and happiness
Thank you very much father
to your health
Cheers
Cheers
Come in
i have just heard the great news
Congratulations i hope we celebrate it as it deserves
Rita please
i am busy
you jerk you used to say beautiful things about my lips
could it be on account of the little doctor you go out with
i do not like to hear nonsense forgive me
what is the matter with you
i came to hug you because i heard you received an inheritance and you treat me like this
i haven't inherited anything
then it is all a joke
my brother Miguel is the one who inherited it
Excuse me
anyway i am happy
not more than i
i can imagine
some crazy aunt
no if you really must know it was an old friend of our parents who without even knowing him left him more than a million pesos
Just like in the movies
and nothing for you
nothing
that is strange
i do not think it is strange at all
each one is free to leave his money to whomever he pleases
do not get mad honey
after all you are the oldest and
what
nothing
but the reasonable thing would have been to leave the money to the two of you
will you go away and leave me alone
Carlos i can understand your bad mood but i am your friend and i am warning you this will create a bad feeling among the staff
what the hell do you mean
Careful you are hurting me
you are very smart little doctor
Give it a little thought and you will understand
Ah
yes yes yes
as far as i am concerned I'd rather prefer to be shot
i believed it might prove more dangerous
i do not see why
Mom is right
the bullet may only scratch you while the wine goes trough your stomach
so what
nothing
the wine only burns the stomach messes up the nervous system and slows the digestion
and at your age makes you prone to apoplexy
it is true that you do not take care of yourself
Today's doctors are all the same
do not drink do not eat do not smoke do not dance
Well you understand
Foolishness
Well do what you want
i already warned you
do not get mad son
you are nervous irritable
you do not want to spoil your brother's party do you
Ofcourse not mother
Let's celebrate the return ofthe prodigal son who did not go on a trip
i will drink to Miguel's health
Rigor in my father's prescription and benevolence in your colleague
Very nice
that is the truth
i have a license to prescribe myself poison whenever i want
what will Don Feliciano do
Wait Carlos
one moment please
Dear friends we have gathered here in great friendship to celebrate the appearance of reluctant lady luck to this home
i toast to our dear Miguel hoping he will make good use of the inheritance and that he may live a long and happy life
Miguel give me a drop before the attending doctor returns
are not you going to reply to Don Feliciano Miguel
i am grateful for your words but you already know that speaking in public is not one of my talents
i thought we were among family
at last we heard your voice
we are indeed among relatives and in a family that will soon increase its wealth
do not joke like that i do not like it
Forgive me mother
Silence Miguel is going to talk
Above all i want to thank everybody for the good wishes and sincerity you show me and then announce that
i have decided to buy the house in which Carlos and i had decided to establish a clinic
Tomorrow i will sign the deed
i want to do everything as you wanted Carlos
and just because i am the ownerdoesn't mean you won't be the director
after all it was your idea
what do you say Carlitos
i am very sorry Miguel but i can not accept your offer
it is not in my plans to accept charity and if some day i accomplish something it must be through my own effort and not
that is all
i did not want to offend you
i am sorry
you are free to accept orrefuse what your brother offers you
but you will apologize to him and to all here for your rudeness
do not forget that you are still in my house
Forgive me everyone especially you Miguel
i did not mean to offend you
the conduct ofthat young man has been deplorable and i am not about to tolerate it
he is young his ambition was the clinic and you spoiled it for him
it is natural that he should be hurt
and now you will side with him
you know what i think
it hurts me very much because he is my son but he is jealous of Miguel's inheritance
do not say that
Remember he graduated 5 years ago and despite his efforts he is not been able to accomplish much
besides he knows Miguel wants to share everything with him
Miguel is like me
no wonder he is my son
but that Carlos
i better go talk to him tell him a thing or two
no
Let me do it
we mothers know how to handle these matters
and point out to him how distasteful those outbursts are in front of strangers and not to forbid me to drink
i do what i please
Am i not his father
Relax and sleep Carlos
i will go to see him
are you awake son
Come in mother
what brings you here
i could not have slept without saying goodnight to you
what is the matter son
Why are you in such a bad mood
it is nothing
do not you think your mother knows you well
you behaved badly during dinner
what is the matter
i do not know
Nerves
my father exasperates me so much sometimes
i do not really know
are you sure that is all
you and your intuition mother
do not get mad at me
but i thought that since your plans failed and good fortune was on your brother's side without him even looking for it that had left you jealous
me jealous
you myson
you are with your mother which is like being with yourself
Tell me the truth
i think you are right mother
what a shame
do not worry
that will pass without leaving any trace
you will see
in the meantime try to bury those bad thoughts
all my life i have wanted to be someone above all for you
Miguel is my brother but for him the career is nothing but an ornament
to me research experimentation discovery is the great ambition ofmy life
you see
i lack the means
is that fair mother
it is useless to revolt against what is already done
but do not get depressed
Continue as you have up to now
have faith
in good fortune
in everything
in me who loves you so much
in you mother yes
yes
Good night son
Sleep well
Carlos i want to talk to you for a moment
Tell me
Luisa is downstairs and we are meeting mom to pick out furniture for the newhouse
i would like you to join us
are you crazy
i am on duty all day
Manzano can cover for you
i do not like asking for favors
i will go tomorrow
did not you want to tell me something
yes i have been meaning to ask you something
i hope you understand and
what is it about
are you in love with Luisa
me
where did you get that idea
i just thought so
i wanted to ask you because
i do love her
Well tell her not me
i already did
and she accepted
Howdo you know
and how else could it be
you are a distinguished charming young man and above all very rich
you are pulling my leg Carlos
i am serious
i love her
but i also came to tell you that if you love her as i think you do
i will leave the coast clear for you
a little late for that and besides it is unnecessary
anyway thank you Miguel
she must have said she is very interested in her career that she is very fond of me since i was her teacher etc
but that is about it
and you
me
i am going to wash my hands
Thank you buddy
See you tomorrow
See you tomorrow
what are you doing here
i was waiting for your brother to leave to talk to you
you too
and in the meantime your patient is neglected
what do you want
Let go
do i have to call you doctor and treat you formally
you must hear me out
Lately i have been thinking about how you enjoyed talking to me
Remember how you used to take me to the movies and to dinner
Why did you change so much
you used to always come for me
i needed to kill time
at least when there are no patients
Seriously you are always in a bad mood upset
i know what it is but i want to help you forget
Carlos why do not you take me dancing on Saturday
we could talk then
are you insane
you think i will stroll around with a nurse
You'd be embarrassed
Men are so odd
Really
what should embarrass them doesn't and
what do you mean
i know what i mean
you are not leaving without telling me
do not touch me
although i am just a nurse
i would not have been embarrassed going out with you
Tell me what you have to say
do not think i am jealous of the lady doctor
everyone knows she is going out with your rich brother
what are you insinuating
you should never offend a woman not even a nurse when you are your mother's son
Take that back or i will
what do you mean
you must be blind or desperate for money to not see why your brother inherited the money
Bitch
if you do not let go ofme i will scream
Until never little doctor
what is the matter Carlos
nothing
Why did you leave so abruptly
i said it is nothing
anything else
nothing
Sleep well son
when will the house be ready
i am taking care of it father
i will go there right after breakfast
the decorators promised it will all be ready tomorrow
Good morning son
Good for some people
i can waitforyou to get dressed
I'd like you to come with me to see your new office
i have a surprise for you
you are very kind and i am very grateful but i do not think i will be able to use it
what
did not we agree
i am thinking of leaving Mexico soon
without telling us son
where to
to the Tropics
to the Tropics
what are you talking about
to the Tropics outside of Mexico
i want to do some research
if my request is granted it will be very soon
Well i will be damned
Your brother wanted to help you get established alongside him
i know Miguel is wonderful and i am very grateful
Worthy heir to such a generous man as Mr Mistral
by the way it is strange that although he was favored so magnificently by our parents' friend he has shown no interest in seeing his face
you are right i hadn't thought of that
now that you mention it i would like that
Surely there must be a picture of him around the house
Right mother
i do not think so
it is been so long that
yes there is a picture
i saw it recently the day you were cleaning out the hallway chest
Your benefactor gave it to us because i told him he looked like a movie star
i hope you find it so Miguel can put it in a gold frame at his clinic
Go get it
Miguel would like to know the face of his benefactor
Mistral was kind and courteous
all your gratitude is not enough Miguel because he could have just as well left the money for Carlos or myself
he never met me so i can not understand why
Actually he did meet you
we mailed him a card regarding your baptism and later on your picture
i believe it was the one of your first communion
here you are
he was not bad looking
Distinguished young
Younger than you right dad
yes fifteen years younger
i do not know why he never married
he always mentioned how much he wanted a family
Why are you standing
Sit down
i am going to my room
so many long faces
and what is the matter with you
nothing
Talking about a dead man reminds me of the troubles of life
Ever since the inheritance you seem to be mourning someone
i am mourning someone
i bet it is a woman
yes a woman
Did you break up with her
Worse even
she died in my heart
but there is really no reason to be sad
she was not worthy
Rosario
what is it dear
what is it
Let's get her something fast
Carlos what are you doing there
Hurry up
her pulse is weak
what do you think it is
Prescribe her a sedative
something mild
what is wrong with her
nothing serious
and do not be concerned she will probably have quite a few more of those
Mom calm down
it was nothing you will be fine soon
but
more
more
there
that is perfect do not you think
i agree but do you think the clinic's success depends on this table
do not make fun ofme
little things go a long way
what do you think
what a house
and what a great business
you took the best Spanish chest i had
you have good taste
the clinic is fabulous
a real treasure
and what does the critic say
i am convinced
yes
it is not bad
do not trust him Miguel
he is a joker
i am leaving
i have a lot of work
we will see each other at dinner time
what is the matter father
nothing
Just some shortness of breath once in a while
do not blame anyone for my death said whoever said it
it is no one's fault i run around all day Iong
be careful
we will walk you to the garden
Let's go
how funny how womanly
what
Luisa
she feels she owns the house the owner and the one million pesos
Women are so sentimental and indifferent
do not say that about Luisa she is not like that
she has her own money a career
you would defend her
one never sees his mother as a woman but when you do you can find out surprising things
you know what i am thinking
you defend Luisa because you would have done exactly the same thing
how can you say that
Howcan you even think that
and you even laugh
you are crazy
i am having fun and learning
Look
that kiss will cost Miguel a million pesos
i won't let you say that
Luisa is honesty in person and you know it
yes she personifies the honesty of all women
Interesting dilemma proving a woman can be honest
Very honest and still cheat on her husband
she will do it and she won't be the first or the last one
you are so cruel
you have no idea how cruel and unfair you are being
i am sorry to say it but i was not born to be a husband thank goodness
what is the matter mother
are you ill
it is nothing
i am just a bit dizzy again
i am fine now
do you need anything
do not worry
i am fine
are you sure
Sure son
Sit here mother
are you really feeling better
yes my son i am
can you handle some good news
when is the wedding
you knew
and you do not know how happy i am you will be very happy
Really
Really
Mother
what an amazing ceremony
i admit that when you put yourself to it you go all the way my friend
yes and it cost me a lot
i did not allow Miguel to pay a cent for the banquet
Right Miguelito
be careful Don Feliciano
Starting today Luisa won't be caring for you anymore
Right Luisa
Let him eat
Today is a special day
Look at your mother she barely even tasted the mushrooms
do not say that
they served me too much
are you happy
Immensely
the day would be complete if Carlos had come
here is to the couple
Congratulations
you show up now
you think it is right to miss your brother's wedding
i am a busy doctor father
the kind that works for a living
do not argue now
you are right
i want to make a toast
is there a glass for me
Let me have this one
Cheers Miguel
Cheers Luisa
this toast is to the alliance of science beauty and wealth
and also to women's fidelity
if you told us the joke we would laugh with you
there is nothing fairer Don Feliciano
i am also toasting Dr Carlos Montero Jimenez that is me
a member of the Institute of Tropical Diseases who will soon leave on a trip without honey nor moon
Congratulations man
you got it
i also congratulate you if that is what you want
Thank you dear people
Nobody can imagine how happy a man can be without money without a wife without the danger of losing the wife of losing the money
Carlos you have been drinking
Stop being impertinent and sit down and eat something
yes i drank a little
but you must not do it anymore
i have warned you many times
i propose a toast
Luisa Miguel you have given me the happiest day of my life
a toast for my son Miguel who is the one that has given me the most happiness
he is rich young he has married a marvelous girl and carries my name
what more does one want
and to toast them for the happiness we are all here eating well drinking even better because that is the reason i spent my money
because if my son is splendid his father is more
he is exactly like me
he has all my qualities and none ofmy faults which are many
and i toast to this son who today married this angel i
Carlos
Father
Excuse me
Excuse me
he is dead
at least he died happy
Death spared him from many disappointments
what is new Carlos
Leaving already
the plane leaves at ten
how is mother
i think she needs a good rest
it is not necessary
Women have an incredible amount of strength and great strength of character
she has not shed one tear
you know that people who do not cry suffer the most
that is what they say
i will go see her
Carlos i know this is not the best time but since you are leaving i want to clarify a matter with you
Go ahead
we haven't talked since that day at the clinic when you asked me
who is thinking about that now
you are Miguel's wife
it is my fault for believing you were different
you are mistaken Carlos
when you told me about your love i did not want to hurt you but i have been in love with Miguel since way back
i am sorry but i do not believe you
the inheritance made you change course
you are like all the rest
Vulgar ambitious and capable of selling yourself for
Poor guy
you are sick with jealousy and envy
Jealousy
Envy
of my brother the imbecile
of the good deal you have done
what i feel is repulsion contempt
Luisa where are you going
what happened
Ask your brother
i am going back home
what did you say to Luisa
to the doctor
i was telling her about the vulgarity ofwomen
first of all do not call her doctor in that tone of voice
she is my wife Carlos
that is right
you were the purchaser
i order you to take back what you just said
you ordering me
you are crazy
you want me to tell you what i think
it breaks my soul to say it but you are jealous
Envious
i am ashamed to be your brother
Jealousy right
of your great talent
would you have been able to write your thesis without me
or do you think i am jealous because you married Luisa
with money you can buy everything
then it is my money you envy
since i received the inheritance you had to bring up the money
Shut up or i won't be responsible for my actions
for weeks you haven't been able to say one word to my mother my father Luisa or me
you cowardly torture mother as if she was responsible for my inheritance and i will not shut up
besides i am going to order you to respect me
Respect you idiot
you who has dishonored us with your inheritance
what did you say
Repeat it
i say one cannot accept the fortune of a man when one claims he is the son of another
are you mad
you are the son of the man who left you his fortune
you are not an honest man because an honest man doesn't accept the money that stains one's mother
Bastard
if you come close i will
Why did you make me tell you
you should have kept quiet
how can you say that about mother
how could you know
the happy child
Pampered and rich who never knew anything
for many days i haven't slept eaten or known what i am doing or what i am saying because i am oppressed by shame and pain
and my mother
i should never have told you anything
Say it again to my face or i will kill you
no Miguel no
Tell me it is not true mother
Tell me
It'strue Miguel
Carlos told the truth
no it is not possible
yes Miguel
the man who left you that fortune was your father
the only man i ever loved
then it is true
you betrayed me him and all
i can say it
you betrayed my father
you have covered us with shame
i will not allow you to insult me
mine was not a shameful affair only an impossible union
in order not to abandon you or your father who was sick
i did not go away to live with him forever
i do not ask you for forgiveness
i am not ashamed of those moments of happiness an tenderness
nothing can pay for them in this world
to me he was my real husband and that society in front of which i have covered you with shame was the one that sacrificed my life and my love
do not you feel shame either just as i do not feel it for having loved your father
Together with you two he was the only good thing life has given me
my only love
Even today being dead he is still alive in my heart
now you know everything
if you are ashamed of me leave this house
Forgive me mother
i am the least likely to judge you
Forgive me
Come and live with us mother with Luisa and myself
Please say yes
i will do whatever possible to make you happy
no son
Leave me here with my memories
i will be happy if you are happy
you will always have me here to hold you in my arms
Forgive me too mother
i do not know what to say but i do not want to go
leaving you like this
i will stay here with you and
no son
i appear guiltier in your eyes
you would again look at me like you have been doing lately
i do not hold any grudge
i am your mother and i understand you have suffered
Go away son and may God bless you
Goodbye mother
i will write to you
Mother tell me we will see each other every day
if you need anything you will ask me for it
Leave me alone now
i need to be alone and rest
Goodbye Miguel
i am going to be away for a long time and i hope you do not hold any grudge
you can leave in peace
we will be like before
as always
and do not worry about mother
i will take care ofher
my brother
Carlos
Let's goSUBJECTlVITY
Maybe if they lowered the voting age maybe that would help
Typical how they walk right in front of you
Children should be allowed to vote from the age of ten
from age ten to thirty
and people between thirty and forty should govern
and then
Ah Milerstrasse
after that they needn't have any say
how confidently those men cross the street
the kids might be awfully aggressive at first
oh another one of those goatee types
oh there is a nice boy my mother would say
but i do not believe her
i do not believe him
Damn
oh boy oh boy
Idiot
Well
my how pathetic
i am amazed she doesn't have braids
what is this now
when you
Aw how cute
how did he put it back then in Vienna
Ah to be blond and have tits
Oops caught in the act
Awfully few older people here today
Shit
Wherever you go there is another guy
you look good
now what
Ah the masculinity check
Overnight
yeah
You'd do better to look who is in front of you
Why am i thinking of bread anyway
Men are like billy goats
Rather feminine that guy
my God
how pathetic
they grin and so do you
lf i go to the post office today and the bank tomorrow
they wear belts low in America
or both tomorrow
some wear only belts
what is that foreign word
Sex
yes it is sex
then
Ah an old person
Give it a try
Hey you
Funny where is he
where are they
this is embarrassing
oh there he is
and he is
he is over there okay
it is time i think it is time
i hope he gets on the bus
Look at them grin
they think they have me pegged
Idiots
why is he standing so close all of a sudden
Lieselotte
Hey how about this
Number four kiss
and now
you do not see that every day
now what
what is he doing
why is he getting off
Rather self confident young man i must say
where to chickadee
she is walking
Police
on this whole damn street in this whole damn town there is not a single taxi
if this were on the Moselle man
Hey you i am off now
Nice and expensive
i do not believe she is leaving in a taxi
a ship
a ship arrives
she gets on
he falls in the water
and there it endsHope we do not miss our flight
my dad said Ramsey told them he'd been sneaking his gun in here for months before they ever caught him
he was like proud of it
are you saying that legitimizes this oppressive denial of our right to privacy
Grace i did not put these things up
do not rag on me
they consulted with dad though
that helps Luke
Thanks
i have metal studs on my boxers
it is from my eighth grade iron maiden period
i haven't done a wash in a few says so
Details are not necessary rove
not so fast miss Polk
where are you going Ms Jankow
i quit
first there was those faculty meetings and then the politics then the forms for the supplies
now this
i am not teaching art in a war zone
i have a degree from parsons studied with Judy Chicago
oh oh i am sorry
Adam you are really talented but i i am sorry
what
i did not set off any alarm
so unless you want to sentence me to death for possession of gummy bears i would like to go to class
you seem very upset Joan
Take a breath
Fascist god
that is nice
you know i hope that you are pleased with your work here
you are being cursed by the entire student body you know
i did not do this
i merely provide choices
Adam was just starting to do his art again and now the teacher jets out of here
this totally sucks
Suck is a relative term Joan
Things could be much worse than this
or much better
you are catching on
it all depends
on our choices
yes i know but we do not know how things are gonna turn out until after we choose and then it is too late
this is not a good system
it is a perfect system Joan
but very well argued
you will be an excellent addition to the debate team
Debate
no
no no
uh
i i am already a sub defective
you you want me to devolve into a toad
what
a lively exchange of ideas in search of the truth
who would not love that
uh me
next
his name's Richard Yardley
the maintenance man found him in the alley behind the church called the ambulance
he is the pastor
he must have been going home for the night when it happened
he still had his wallet untouched
so we know the guy who did this was not greedy
his skull is fractured arm broken collarbone 3 ribs internal bleeding
Almost dead
i get it doc
Reverend Yardley
i am will Girardi detective with the county sheriff's department
do you have any idea who might have done this to you
any idea why
Gay
someone did this because you are gay
but he was not greedy
Well this heightened security has really made the school function better hasn't it mom
not now Joan
i am a little stressed in case you are blind
Ok here is your late slip your history book and the paper you were working on
you were looking through my room
sometimes you forget things
i was trying to help
that is what a mother does
a helicopter mother
Sorry
Helicopter
Hovering
Always overhead
i did not need these today
that is why i left them in my room
Mr Price can we please forgo the formality of the late slips
the teachers understand why the kids are not in class
you want the system to break down on the first day
we can hope
i want to drop art
what
it is the only class you like Rove
without art to break up your day you are gonna get all morose and morose belongs to me
the teacher's gone yo
they are gonna have one lame sub after another teaching us how to draw a dog
i will work on my own in my shed
Adam you need art on your transcript if you are gonna go to art school
i know that you think you do not want to go to college but you might someday
Give yourself the option
Option
that is good mom
you need them
Options
i i have a friend that is into options
Forget it
Listen Adam price put me on the search for the new art teacher
i will find you a good one i promise
yeah there are tons of inspiring artists lining up to teach high school
i am sure there is one and that is who we will try to find
i talked to the woman who lives across from the church
she was on her porch when the attack occurred
she saw some cars passing
one turned into the alley
Blue American big dent on the side
Let's show her some pictures try and get a match for make and model
i also talked to the church staff
they were surprised to learn the reverend was gay
not the guy who beat him
i mean using the victim's blood to write this on the car
oh yeah
we are dealing with a true believer here
this has nothing to do with god will
not much does from the looks of this
Ok
Place your reagent in your calorimeter and put a fire under your H2o bath
Excite those molecules people
Start that fiery tango of particles body slamming into each other
so did it hurt getting your navel pierced
Dude do not talk about my navel
some people find the pain very erotic
was it
you are foul
Eroticism is not a negative Joan
it is a part of life
not yours
he is right
it is a fact that the oddest things can arouse powerful feelings of you know
i have been teaching a health class to middle school kids at the y
they are so sweet
after class i am going to sneak off campus for lunch
who wants to join me
i can not
i am joining the debate team
what
Excellent
i am on the debate team
me too
yeah i know
Cheerleaders chess team
now debating
there is easier ways to bring pain into your life
i am a joiner ok
i like to be involved
Becoming involved in the increasingly totalitarian regime of this school makes a mockery of involvement
Grace it is debate team not north Korea
Save your breath
do i look like i am on the team
Graduated Harvard divinity in 1989 was a chaplain during the first gulf war started an outreach program for at risk kids and took over the church last may
all things worthy of a beating
how is he doing
he is gonna make it but they think there is brain damage
he will never be the same
i mean he is going to have a lot to deal with
i did not mean it is ok
i am just sorry me being vertically challenged makes you uncomfortable
you know that is getting really tiresome
Tell me about it
do you know what it is like trying to get something of the top shelf
i am not taking the bait this time
this is not about you being in that chair
if us getting close makes you uncomfortable yeah
it was a kiss Rebecca
one kiss
you are right and neither one of us can stop thinking about it
Dinner my place Friday night
we will sort things out then
the hole in the ozone is causing the level of the oceans to rise as much as 10 feet per decade
there is no tangible evidence that polar ozone depletion is caused by human interference
in fact the 1991 eruption of mount Pinatubo sent more toxic chemicals into the atmosphere than anything man is doing to the environment
every study shows the levels of fluorocarbons rising at a steady rate
every study
what kind of citation is that
Ok ducklings
Pas mal
Mr Friedman your valid point is seriously compromised by your belligerent tone
Amend it
Ok so what do we think
Did affirmative properly establish significance and harm
um you uh mystery lady
i am Joan
Joan Girardi
uh
i i do not have any idea what you are talking about
but i assume you have an interest in debate or you would not be here
so who do you think was more persuasive Ms Girardi
um
Glynis but i disagree with her
the beauty of debate
i would imagine that eloquent oxymoron is one of the reasons your joining us
i am dying to be a elegant moron
Well uh then in preparation for our public debate on Thursday
let's pair off while i assign the resolution
Girardi Brooks
Your topic
Resolved the new security measures at arcadia high school create a more productive learning environment for all
you will be pro
this is my first time
i am totally an amateur
uh pro pro means that you will be uh arguing in favour of the security measures
Great
hi
i am Joan
you should probably know i suck at debate
S s so d d do i
i am s s scott
Sorry you w w wound up with me
Hey it is ok
it is cool
Ugh
i hate this
what
the stupid internet
i put in a simple search
264 879 pages found
how does that make life any easier
Well what are you looking for
Information about zero tolerance policies in schools
Interesting topic
are you pro or con Joan
i am annoyed as long as you are asking
can i have a bite of that
i had to skip lunch for this remember
Sure
Thanks
how do you expect me to be on a debate team with someone who can not even talk
i mean i feel bad for him and everything but debate is really a speaking thing you know
and there is time limits
i mean he would get like 2 words off before the bell would go off
it is humiliating
how do you think he feels
no eating in here Ms Girardi
so this is about Scott
everything is connected Joan
you should have learned that by now
this whole inscrutable thing is getting very old you know
i put you in debate because it is an excellent way for people to find their own voice
so it is about Scott
Try adding more search terms narrow things down
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
how can i cure someone's stuttering in 2 days
Ms Girardi
you got to forget about grace dude
but i get these feelings
i know it is a biological reaction we are not taking biology here
we are talking psychology
you are always throwing yourself against the one gate that is locked
and why
because you are afraid of going through the gate and enjoy the pleasures of the garden hey hey
i am not afraid of going through the gate
then why are you always walking right past the one gate that is wide open
and do not tell me you do not know who i am talking about
Glynis
she is wacky for you dude
when i took her to the dance all she talked about was you
Extremely annoying but uh it is because i was wearing cologne and everything
i can not just transfer my feelings from one person to another
of course you can
it is built into our DNA
Did you see the look Glynis gave you in Chem today
that is a look you usually have to download
Ok
i appreciate the rather base concern but i can take care of my own love life
Right in the shower
it was not me
i was home
i do not have to say anything else till my lawyer gets here
2 witnesses i D Ed your car Mr Shoalar
the little league bat you used your kid's nice touch was found in a dumpster 2 blocks away but you were home the whole time
i am sure your lawyer will find that an excellent defence
i am not talking to you
you see what happens in an attempted murder case like this when the perp that is you in this case when the perp remains silent and offers no explanation no remorse the jury has a tendency to give him the max
what is that in this case detective
40 years no parole
a small price to pay for doing the lord's work
you think god intended someone like him to minister to people
not sure
i do not have his phone number like you seem to
what should i have done
he touched my boy
he molested my son
15
what the hell would you have done if somebody did something like that to your kid
what the hell would you have done
what is all this
Stuff for mom to sign permission slips and tests
you can not do this
it says there is a danger of physical injury
it is a nature walk
we are going to be looking at beetles
but it says physical injury right here
Mom
it always says that will
it was on their permission slip when they went to see Hairspray
Well why did they go see Hairspray
how is that school
it is theatre honey
i will sign these
Set the table
Mom do you know where my blue shirt is
it is in the hamper
i will do wash tomorrow
do not worry
it will be ready for your date
who said anything about a date
Rebecca called
she wanted you to bring some dessert
you and Rebecca have a date
she is cooking him dinner
so is mom
it doesn't mean i am dating her
that is a disgusting analogy
are other people coming or just Rebecca
Just them
oh yeah
that is a date
Mom do not look
the men are leering
so i heard you arrested the guy who tried to kill the pastor
Attempted murder
that is one way to change the subject
yeah but it is getting more complicated
i heard he accused the reverend of abusing his son
he said that is why he attacked him
no comment
there is always a grey area in every situation dad
that is what a reasoned verbal exchange tries to explore and logic can provide proof even when there is no evidence what does that even mean
what is she doing now
Joan joined the debate team
as if she weren't contrary enough
she has to argue in support of the draconian security measures instituted by the school
Assisted by you
Spend a day seeing what i do and you'd ask for more
we are gonna study
Assuming we still have the right to assemble
oh Adam i have got lots of applicants for the new art teacher
Cool
Ok
we have to determine the heat of a solution of an ionic compound in water
Ok
uh o q heat q water q solution
yeah but what does that mean
can you believe what we have to learn to go to college to get away from our parents
Hey this is not chemistry Yo
the necessity of martial law
Abdicating civil rights
are you insane
it is research
you really are the daughter of a cop are not you
Grace i joined a club
it means nothing
Words have power
you are giving power to this
Understanding and controlling stuttering
oh great
so she is helping someone stop stuttering so they can spout this repressive propaganda
if i can help Scott speak in front of a crowd do not you think that is a good thing
not if you are turning him into a mouthpiece for tyranny
Wait wait wait wait wait
Ok i understand that we disagree about debate but you are doing this whole seething smoke coming out of your ears thing
we can disagree and still be friends
this is fundamental
this is basic human rights
Friend
i am doing this to help Scott
Guess we are not gonna study tonight are we
Why did not you tell me the school needed an art teacher
Well i do not tell you a lot of things that happen at school will because most of it is boring but since you are suddenly interested um
Marlene got an ugly paper cut today
are you applying
i beg your pardon
to be the uh art teacher
you are qualified
the administration knows you
the kids love you
do not be ridiculous will
i could never take that job
you work already
Well the hours would be a lot longer than they are now
There'd be papers to grade lessons plans to create the after school conferences
and you'd love it
this house would fall apart
We'd all pitch in
you think it is so easy
our genius son can not even find the salt
Helen we can do it
i will make a list of chores and everyone hey
i am no just some housekeeper you can replace
i am a mother and that means being available to my children whenever they need me and the kids do still need me will
of course they do
not necessarily in the same way they have in the past
how would you know that
you are at work all day and when you are at home you run off ever time you get paged
i am not blaming you
i understand and i am proud of the way you do your job
it is just
i would have thought you would have understood me too
i am not trying to fight here Helen
some things would have to change yes well they are not going to not now not while my kids still need me
Ok
Whatever you want
this is your decision
so these notes you made on the advantages of school security
Really good like professional good
'Cause at first i did not agree at all then i read these notes your notes they totally convinced me
C c cool
so why do not you read them to me
Nah
Come on Scott
they are primo
you should have enough confidence to shout this stuff out to the world
Come on
Let me hear that voice of yours
S s school crime has d d decreased that is good
Good
this time look at me ok
Just look right into my eyeballs when you say it
Eyeballs
Confidence
Confidence
Eyeballs
got it
i i i d d do not n n need another s s speech therapist
what
no i i am not
i have always been into stuttering
i mean how about that left hemisphere of the brain messing up the messages to the mouth huh
i mean who hasn't read about that
Look i do not want to be h h here ok
my f father thinks that d d debating will help but it only make things w w worse
but you have so many great ideas in here and some very impressive big words
i mean it would take 2 guys to lift these words
they are so big
Look all you have to do is find your voice Scott
Just let the world know what great thoughts you have
my voice
yeah
Listen if Winston Churchill Marilyn Monroe James Earl Jones Carly Simon if they can all cure stuttering so can you
who is c c carly simon
i do not know but James earl Jones is Darth Vader
that is so freaky
my my dad was just trying to protect me that is all
i know Daniel but even if the allegations against the reverend Yardley are true your father still has to answer for what he did
Well they are true
and the court will take that into consideration in your father's case
we just need to get a statement from you
i was at the church and i helped out there sometimes with the after school committees and reverend Yardley seemed nice
we talked
he was a good listener and then this one day he asked me to come to his office and that is when it happened
he um you know he put his his hands on me down there and then he tried to kiss me and touch me and take your time son
my dad told me not to spend time with him
Why
what do you mean
Well did he suspect something happened
no
no
i just meant you know being gay
it is a sin
you know Daniel my daughter said something the other night
she is on the debate team
she said logic is a way to find truth and what you are telling me son it just doesn't seem logical
Why
Well if your father did not know then that the reverend was gay why would he tell you to avoid him
he touched me and it was a sin
they why did not your father come to us first
you know he was so mad and he kept yelling about being gay and he just would not listen
so you tried to talk to him
yeah
you did not want him to hurt reverend Yardley
no
but he wanted to because he was gay not because he was a molester
my dad was just trying to protect me
he was not you know he did not want me getting mixed up mixed up
i look he told me I'd go to hell
he is my dad
he is supposed to know what is best right
and was the reverend telling you something different
i hated myself being this way
i was always so alone
i wanted to kill myself
he said the reverend Yardley he said that god loved me no matter what
he was not i mean he understood what it was like
he was not even gay and he understood me
so he did not touch you
he was my friend
when i tried to talk to my dad he just screamed that the reverend made me a fag
he ran out of the house telling me I'd see what happened to sinners like him but i did not know what he was gonna do
i swear to god
i am sorry
i he was my friend
the reverend was my friend
he was my friend
he was my friend
i uh i c c compiled all the data and wrote an opening a a affirmation
Wow
this is fearsome Scott
you did all this in one night
W w writing is no problem
Apparently not
Writing is kind of like your voice huh
i g g guess so
and the world can hear you this way
you can let people know what you think this way right
W w what are you s s saying
this is your voice Scott
you have to go with your voice
you should be like writing for the paper or something
you mean q q quite debate
no no not quitting moving on to what is right for you
would not you love to see your stuff in the paper
yeah
then do it
this is about you
not your dad
not Mr Enfield
this is about you your voice
yeah
i i i am a w w writer
yeah
i q q quit
i beg your pardon Mr Brooks
Q q quit
i i quit
Thank you
i quit
i totally have this down God
so any luck finding Adam an art teacher
no and Price says he is gonna fill that position by Friday no matter what
Adam told price he should hire you
Really
yeah
can you imagine
you grading my friends
Eww and eww
i used to teach you know and i have been exhibited
what are you saying mom
you can not teach at my school
it is like incest or something
i am going to go get the hamburger meat
hi
2 1 2 pounds of hamburger meat please
so you quit debate huh
should not you be in the produce section
i always thought God would be a vegetarian
you know i was surprised
you were only in debate for 3 days because i am good
i am so getting this whole mission thing
i am even getting better at the riddles
Finding his voice
that was a good one
because at first i thought i had to cure his stuttering which according to the book could take years oh lean beef please
my mom's on a health kick
you are not done Joan
but i completed the mission
i wanted you to join the debate team to be in a debate
Come on
if i argue in favour of that stupid policy Grace is totally gonna write me off
so your position has no validity at all
yeah
Ha
Grace is all political and knows about this stuff and i know what a drag it is to get searched
so you think believing something to be true makes it true
Well if believing in things is wrong that would put you out of business pretty fast would not it
i do not exist because people believe in me
i simply exist whether they believe in me or not
Hanging onto beliefs that is not truth
Open your mind Joan
Read what Scott gave you
be a part of that debate tomorrow
here
Doesn't get any fresher than this
i just ground it
i can not believe Grace won't talk to me
Why
i went for weeks without talking to you and i can not hold a grudge like she can
yeah but you had a good reason
she is being a jerk
you dont think she is right do you
i usually do not listen to what is going on unless i hear my name
i mean there are arguments on the other side
Scott put together some amazing facts that i could not get out of reading
Grace could at least come to the debate and listen
she is
oh
how about you
me
yeah are you coming
you want me to
Well yeah
yeah i will come
Adam we are ok now are not we
S sure
we are us
here are the applications
i put the best one on top a Mr Rooney
uh fine
Put them in my in box and i will go through them in the morning
Ok
um he is not ideal though'cause he does go on
i mean i had to sit and listen to him denigrate abstract expressionism
he feels dekooning and pollock are overrated
they are only responsible for one of the major artistic revolutions of the twentieth century
do i seem engaged in this discussion Helen
no
as usual no
um i will put them in your in box
i uh i talked to my dad about the Yardley beating
Wrote a follow up
you can use it if you want
the kid's going to live with his aunt
when he went to say good bye to his father the guy would not even look at him
Kevin this is wonderful
a little uh loose and free with the commas but hey it is tight
Descriptive
Thanks
uh listen
uh about tonight
uh i can not make it
i have a family thing
so sorry about the short notice
Kevin we can just have a nice dinner
no we can not
it is already more than that
this this used to be easy for me Rebecca
i mean i used to know how to handle a night like this but i am not that guy anymore
i never knew that guy
i invited the guy you are now
and uh
i think i should figure out who that is first
Go
i have doubts
and you think your doubts have any validity
you were certain about Grace
you were dead wrong
it is not your field dude
Go
i am engaging in an exploratory mission
that is all
Glynis
i just wanted to wish you luck on the debate
Thanks
it is kind of awkward that i am opposing Joan but are you ok
you are flushed and your breathing is rapid and shallow
you must you must be the best health teacher at the y
i feel it is important to have a complete grasp of the information in order to teach the kids
Your breathing is also increasing
it has to do with restricted capillaries and increased blood flow you know
i know
the hypothalamus gland processes external and intellectual stimuli which causes tells the body how to respond
yeah i read the Walen and Roth study
we seem to share a lot of the same interests
yes
so you must know that if my heart rate continues to increase i might get light headed which would not be good for the debate
no not at all
so i should go
of course
there was a study um published in the Washington post that said uh one incident of minor one incident of minor violence in school you know like someone getting decked or mugged can lower the rate of graduation
that was like a complete surprise was not it
uh psychologists at um
uh um psychologists at uh at John's Hopkins big big important medical school have found that while increased security can also create a sense of anxiety that the anxiety is nothing next to the sense of security which allows students to focus on their study
so they can grow up and be part of a system which will take away even more of our civil rights
this is not a free for all
it is a debate
Please continue Ms Girardi
um ahem
in Florida their zero tolerance policies are responsible for a 37 reduction you know this whole debate is a joke
i uh i have a very strong rebuttal
Like it matters
no matter what happens in this debate those metal detectors will still be there
they will still stop us and search us
i would like you to leave ms
Polk
oh gee
Remember free speech Mr Price
Remember decorum
Manners
Civility
yeah all the things they use to keep us down
Well guess what
Today is about freedom
you call what you are doing right now free speech
you are not debating this young woman Ms Girardi
i suggest you not deviate from the rules
we are so gonna win this debate
that is right Girardi
Party line
that is what it is about
all right out
and what is it about for you Grace
Your idea of freedom is a world where everybody agrees with you
you believe in this crap
i do not know what i believe
i know Ramsey came in here with a gun
i know people could have died
you me
you said i think like this because my father's a cop
Like that is bad
yeah my dad is a cop and you may think that makes him some kind of pig but he deals with those guns every day
this is not some political thing for him
this is reality
he is had them pointed at him and shoved in his face and that makes it real for me too because every time i hear the cops are someplace and shots are fired i wonder if i am ever gonna see my father again
i i do not think we should have to like live in some prison
that sucks
but i do know we have to deal with this
we have to work something out
Even if it is not what we started believing in the first place
i i know i am mouthing off Mr Enfield and i can not cite some report to back up my theories
this is just how i feel
Sorry i messed up the debate
you made quite an impression in there
i do not need the sarcasm
i tried to debate
i tried to do what you wanted and i lost it ok
i thought it all turned out just fine
what you did up there it was true
you found your voice
Great
Ha ha
Great
Thanks for the lesson
it cost me my friend
oh what
because you two do not agree about things
i do not have a lot of friends ok
do you know what grace is Joan
yeah pissed off
do you know the meaning of grace
it is a touch of truth that lets you see the world in a new way
it is a gift that can only be felt when you are open enough to accept it
um
i do not really apologize so um so this is not happening but uh
i just should've thought about you
Thank you
you would've been so proud of her will
Somehow these days every time we are proud of Joan it involves chaos
do you think that is good
i do not think we have a choice
i filled out the application today will
what
for art teacher
after everything calmed down i realized how much braver my little girl was than me so
i filled out the application i threw the others away and i just left mine in Price's in box
you are the first person i have told
i am so scared will
you can not be brave if you are not scared
it will be ok
Sure
Why are you home so late
Paperwork
you were gonna come give me a kiss right
Always
Just do not flunk her
i do not think any of us could handle thatNARRATOR

Somebody has to die at your hands
Tried to kill a werewolf
Failed

GUNFlRE THEN GROANlNG

Somewhere safe

i do not trust anyone
i do not trust Mason
i wanna be there today to keep an eye on him

KATHERlNE

i promise you we are gonna get through this
i love you Stefan
you know i love you
i love you too
KNOCKlNG ON DOOR
i need to talk to you
and when i need to talk to you
Tyler has to kill someone to activate his curse
he is not a werewolf yet
Wow fascinating
not enough
but Mason Lockwood is and he is looking for a moonstone a special rock connected to the werewolf legend
that is why he is here
a moonstone
and i know where it is
and you are bringing me this why
do i need a reason
Look i just wanna help okay
What'd your sister say about this little discovery
oh you haven't told her have you
Elena doesn't want me getting involved
and you are a Gilbert
you just can not help yourself
Wow
Your search for life's purpose is as obvious as it is tragic
are you gonna let me in or not
Jenna thanks for helping wrangle the volunteers
of course
it is for a good cause
Plus i have always been a sucker for the masquerade ball
so was Richard
this was always his favorite party of the year
MATT
Wait wait wait
Boys be careful with that
it is from the 1800s
Excuse me
Tyler
Mom we got it
JENNA
Stefan
Hey
Hey
i am cooking dinner tonight
Ric will be there
you should come
oh um
you know Elena and i we are kind of taking a
a pause
Really
because that is not what it sounded like this morning
Light sleeper
you know what
i heard nothing
you are here
i am here
ELENA SlGHS
Caroline's not coming
i told you
Just making sure
Eventually you are gonna have to talk to her
could you make it less obvious you are on her side
there are no sides Bonnie
Come on
since Caroline became a vampire we barely see each other
Losing Caroline was bad enough
i did not think I'd lose you too
Come with me
where
not here
Someplace quiet
we have to talk
DOOR UNLOCKS
you did not eat much
Good news
Dr Damon said the vervain's almost out of your system
so with any luck you will be freshly compelled and back in your own bed by tonight
are you really just gonna pretend like i do not exist
yes
so please go
SCOFFS
as usual you do not care
got it
Just like before i was a vampire
it is not like i died or anything
FORBES
are you
are you really dead
yes and no
how is it possible
Ric
what are you doing here
Helping Damon
i am the one who found out about the moonstone
does Elena know you are here
not exactly
what do you got
this is Isobel's research from Duke
her assistant sent it to me
Mm
Vanessa the hottie
yeah
Vanessa
yes
do you remember the Aztec curse she told us about
Sun and the moon blah blah blah
the Aztec curse
Cool
Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power
since then uh werewolves can only turn on a full moon and vampires are weakened by the sun
most of them anyway
According to the legend the werewolf part of the curse it is sealed with the moonstone
what do you mean sealed
DAMON
it is a witch thing
Whatever seals the curse is the key to unsealing the curse
Maybe Mason believes he can use the moonstone to break the curse
if we start believing in some supernatural witchy woo legend from a picture book we are idiots
who has the stone now
Tyler
can you get it
yeah
See
now your life has purpose
so you do believe it
it is the same book that says a werewolf bite kills a vampire
Ignoring it would make me an even bigger idiot
Let's go
BONNlE
i can not believe this
ELENA
it is a lot
i know
Katherine's been doing everything that she can to drive me and Stefan apart and Caroline just got trapped in the middle
it is not that you and Stefan are pretending to fight
it is that i did not even know you guys were fighting at all
i am sorry
i do not wanna keep things from you
you have made it clear where you stand with the vampire thing
so that makes me the odd man out
no
no Bonnie of course not
i know where i stand Elena and i know where you stand
but where do we stand
you are my best friend Bonnie
i did not mean to let this craziness with Caroline get in the way of that
but she needs you too
not yet
i just
she is a vampire
i can not
i think we should get back
SlGHS
Hey Stefan
Hey Mason
was not expecting you here
or anywhere
yeah i had this little accident
but uh i am fine now
what did you do to Sheriff Forbes
oh she is fine too
but from now on you will have to do your own dirty work
not a problem
oh
Excuse me
what is the matter
you okay
when i touched him i saw something
what do you mean like a vision
i saw Elena
you saw Elena
he was kissing her
no Bonnie Elena would not kiss
you did not see Elena
you saw Katherine
GASPS
Damon what are you doing here
Looking for my baby bro
Speaking of could you tell yours to stop following me around
what is going on
Ask eager beaver
what is he making you do
he is not making me do anything
Damon and i
uh no
no way
no no no
there is no Damon and you
there is Damon and whoever Damon's using and those people end up dead
Whatever's going on i want you to stay out of it
i do not care what you want
it is because of you that i am in this mess
so i am sorry you do not really get to tell me what i am gonna do
Katherine's with Mason Lockwood
he got into town right after she did
it makes perfect sense
i know but Mason Lockwood
Werewolf thing aside the guy's a surfer
she is gotta be using him
she has to be
Using him for what
Mason's looking for a moonstone that allegedly can break the full moon werewolf curse
Maybe Katherine wants it as well
Why
Well
no idea
that is the beauty of Katherine
she is always up to something
how are we gonna find this moonstone
Jeremy's getting it from Tyler
Why would you involve Jeremy
he is playing Indiana Jones
he involved himself
she is this amazing girl one minute and then this raging jealous freak the next
you know what i think of Caroline Forbes
she is an insecure neurotic bitchy little twit
Hey
but the girl's got heart
she means well
Just gotta take the good with the bad sometimes
yeah
i am gonna go get an extension cord
i will be right back
Hey man
Hey
Hey so i uh
i did a little research on that stone you showed me
what
Why
JEREMY
i do not know
Curiosity
uh boredom
What'd it say
it is part of this Aztec legend
i wanna make sure it is the same kind of stone
you think i could uh check it out again
Nope
Gave it to my uncle
Why'd you do that
because i am done with legends and curses
i do not want anything to do with it okay
yeah
uh yeah sure
it is probably just stupid folklore anyways
Forget it
okay
okay
this is as far as i go
okay
what do you want
a favor
Like that is gonna happen
so predictable
that is why i brought him
i know how you feel about helping us out
since you are the one that linked Mason with Katherine we have an opportunity to get an upper hand on them
so just hear us out
Pretty please
LlNE DlALlNG
PHONE RlNGlNG
i am listening
i have to fill Elena in on what is going on
can you play nice please
yes
Hey
you should not be calling me
i have no idea what is happening
Damon's got Jeremy into something
you have got Bonnie with you
i am sorting stupid masquerade masks for Mrs Lockwood
all right
it is okay
Hold on
Touch Mason again see if he gave Katherine the moonstone
my visions do not work like that
i do not get to ask questions
how inconvenient
although let's talk about that witchy juju thing you do with me the fun one where my brain bursts into flames
what is that
that is me giving you an aneurism
Your blood vessels go pop but you heal quickly so i do it over and over again
is it vampire specific
It'd work on anyone with a supernatural healing ability
Good
Good good
Damon i am not gonna help you hurt him
Mason Lockwood's a werewolf
Katherine's evil
they are the bad guys
Really
you are gonna play morality police with me right now
Let me put it to you another way
they are a threat to Elena
so you witch are gonna get over yourself and help us
yeah he meant that as a question with a please on the end
Absolutely
Hey can you move your van
Blocked in
Hey how'd you get stuck doing that by yourself
all the guys bailed
something about draft picks
i do not know
i do not speak that language
Let me give you a hand
GROANlNG
Sorry
CAROLlNE
so i mainly drink from blood bags
it is not as good as the fresh stuff but it beats the animal blood that Stefan's been trying to get me to drink
you steal the blood from the hospital
Damon does
i have been pilfering his supply so
as long as you have blood you do not need to kill
i want to
it is my basic nature now
but on a healthy diet i can control it
i am getting better at it
i am better than Stefan
he is a bit of a problem drinker
a bloodoholic
Ha ha
i do not want this for you
i know
but when life gives you lemons
CAROLlNE LAUGHS
Damon's home
BONNlE
here is his bag
as requested
here
Grab that corner
Why are we doing this
i do not wanna stain the carpet

GRUNTS

he is not gonna be out much longer
Whoa
Looks like this guy's used to being tied up
Heh
what are you doing
you are looking for a moonstone
i am trying to help you find it
Good
yeah
Find out if he gave it to Katherine
Find out where she is
and find out what they are gonna do with it once they get it
it is somewhere small
Dark
there is water
Like a sewer
no
Like a well
that can not be right
yeah

Why would it be in a well

GROANS

SlZZLlNG
GROANlNG

Guess i will just have to keep applying pain
PANTlNG

Vervain
Stefan
GRUNTS
Stefan
Elena
Caroline Stefan's down there
and the chain is rusted
i
no no no
you can not
it is filled with vervain
Caroline we have gotta get him out
Well
now
when did you two meet
she seduce you and tell you she loved you
you are supernatural so she can not compel you
i am sure she used her other charms
Katherine's good that way
Thought i told you to leave
i found something in uh Ric's box of stuff
Ooh
what is it
um i did a search on my phone
it is a plant
Aconitum vulparia
Grows in the uh mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere
Commonly known as aconite blue rocket and wolfsbane
what else did you read
every source says something different
one myth says it causes lycanthropy which sounds bogus
another one says that it protects people
and another one says well it is toxic
GROANS
i am guessing toxic
GROANS
what is Katherine doing in Mystic Falls
GROANS
SlZZLlNG
MASON YELLS
Why is she here
she is here with me
Why do you ask
you jealous
how rude of me
you know heh heh i just realized i did not offer you anything to eat
SlZZLlNG THEN GROANlNG
Yummy
COUGHlNG

ELENA
Stefan
CAROLlNE
Stefan
ELENA GRUNTS
i got the stone Stefan
Stefan it is gonna be okay
Everything's gonna be okay
what do you want with the moonstone
Screw you
MlMICS BUZZER
Wrong answer
if he was gonna say anything he would've already
Taking your eyes now
the well
you can find it there
i know where it is
i wanna know what it does and why you want it
i am getting it for Katherine
Why
she is gonna use it to lift the curse
of the moon
Why would a vampire help a werewolf break a curse that keeps them from turning when they want
so i would not have to turn anymore
Why
because she loves me
CHUCKLES
no
now i get it
you are just stupid
Katherine doesn't love you
she is using you you moron
i am done talking
yes you are
Time to take a walk Jeremy
i am staying
no
you should go
i am staying Damon
he is had enough
Just help Tyler
do not let this happen to him
Damon
you wanted to be a part of this
here it is
Kill or be killed
the guy's a werewolf
He'd kill me the first chance he got
so you suck it up or leave
COUGHlNG
he wants me to kill him anyway
do not you Mason
it really is a curse is not it
you know i look at you and i see myself
a less dashing less intelligent version
i love her
oh i know
i have been where you are
but Katherine will only rip your heart out
Let me do it for her
GROANS
you are pretty handy with that thing
yeah well it is a skill
Ha ha
here
JENNA CHUCKLES
Mm
where is the um
the sea salt
Table
MOUTHS
are you okay
CAROLlNE
so i pulled Stefan out of this well and he is all vervained and just rotted but Bonnie was not mean to me once and i just
i really think it is progress you know
i just
what
i am freaking you out
it is just that you have become this person
do not
i
do not
i
we were just starting to get along
this strong this confident person
oh
Thank you
you do not have to take my memories away
i will keep your secret
Look if you are worried about them just say you compelled me
i won't tell
i will never do anything to hurt you
you know we never talk like this
Ever
and today meant so much to me
me too
i know
i know i can trust you
but you are never going to trust them
i am going to take you home
you are going to forget that i am a vampire
i am gonna forget that you are a vampire
you will remember you got sick with the flu
you had a fever
it
Chills and ickiness
and i made you soup and it was really salty
we bickered
you got better
and then your selfish little daughter who loves you no matter what went right back to ignoring you
and all is right in the world
GRUNTS
all this for that
Yup
i see you have exercised your usual restraint
had to be done
DAMON GRUNTS
Carol
Big opportunity in Florida
Gonna be gone
for a long time
will send for my things once i get settled
much love Mason
Let's get rid of the body
Ooh
last number dialed
i wonder who that could possibly be
no no no
do not provoke her
RlNGS
Mason you should've been here an hour ago
Wrong boy toy
Damon
for once you have surprised me
i assume Mason's with you
he is right beside me
although his heart's across the room
you should not have
i have had a very busy day today
Killed a werewolf
Found the moonstone
Did you know that he hid the moonstone in a bottom of a well full of vervain
OVER PHONE
Guess he did not trust you very much
although he did love you
Poor guy
Hey where are you
because i can bring him over
last goodbyes and all that
you have no idea what you have just done
Did i put a kink in your master plan
i am so sorry
do you honestly believe that i do not have a Plan B
and if that fails a Plan C then a Plan D and
OVER PHONE
you know how the alphabet works do not you
Send my love to Stefan
where is Jeremy
he went up to his room
he said he was not hungry
who is she talking to
i do not know
everything go okay today
there were a few hiccups but yeah
of course
i understand
Elena it is for you
ELENA
who is it
hello
KATHERlNE OVER PHONE
hello Elena
Katherine
Did you enjoy your little rendezvous with Stefan this morning
i will always know Elena
i will always be one step ahead of you
when are you gonna figure that out
OVER PHONE
do you know how easy it was to get inside of your house
to replace Aunt Jenna's vervain perfume
OVER PHONE
to convince her to stop drinking her special tea
no
Jenna's been my spy for days now
but unlike you Jenna actually listens to me
so when i suggest the world would be a much better place if she were to just
Jenna no
GRUNTS
ALARlC
Jenna
oh
Jenna
Well you get the idea
WOMAN ON PA
Trauma team to the ER
Trauma team to the ER
is she okay
the doctors told Alaric that she got lucky
she is gonna make it
she is gonna be okay
does she remember what happened
no
nothing
it is all part of Katherine's mind compulsion
now why would Katherine hurt Jenna
because she is trying to send a message
that she could get to anybody
Hey
Hey
Hey
Come here
Look it is gonna be okay
no it is not
she is gonna pay Elena
i do not know how but she is gonna pay
Looks good
CAROL
Thanks
it was nice to see Matt today
he hasn't been around for a while
we have both been busy i guess
have you seen Mason
the guy's been AWOL all day
Actually Tyler Mason headed back to Florida
what
i am sorry honey
i know how much you two hit it off
so he just left
i was hoping he'd stick around
i thought that with your dad gone that
anyway he is gone
so i guess it is just you and me now
i am so sorry
we were stupid
Sneaking around thinking that we weren't gonna get caught
i know
we did this
Stefan Jenna's in the hospital and Jeremy could be next
all because we did not listen to her
because
because we are together
Stefan
i know what you are gonna say to me
then let me say it
i have been so selfish because i love you so much and i know how much you love me
but it is over
Stefan it has to be
Elena i do not
no Stefan
it has to be
Elena
i riled Katherine up
i
i was not thinking
i did not think
it doesn't matter Damon
she won
Katherine won
i apologize if i seem rattled
Circumstances have changed suddenly and i had to adjust
Mind control is a necessary evil
you see i need a werewolf and i have lost the one that i had
now tell me what you are going to do to help me get a new one
i am going to go after Tyler Lockwood
and you are not going to stop
and i am not going to stop
Until
Until he kills me

INTERNATlONAL CRlTICSAWARD
AND
FlLMWRlTERS' AWARD
you saw nothing in Hiroshima
nothing
i saw everything
i saw the hospital i am sure of it
the hospital in Hiroshima exists
how could i not have seen it
you did not see the hospital in Hiroshima
you saw nothing in Hiroshima
Four times at the museum
what museum in Hiroshima
Four times at the museum in Hiroshima
i saw people walking around
People walk around lost in thought among the photographs the reconstructions for lack of anything else
the photographs the photographs the reconstructions for lack of anything else
the explanations for lack of anything else
Four times at the museum in Hiroshima
i watched the people
i myself lost in thought looked at the scorched metal
the twisted metal
Metal made as vulnerable as flesh
i saw the bouquet of bottle caps
who would have thought
Human flesh suspended as if still alive its agony still fresh
Stones
Charred stones
Shattered stones
Anonymous masses of hair that the women of Hiroshima upon waking in the morning would find had fallen out
i was hot in Peace Square
10 000 degrees in Peace Square
i know it
the temperature of the sun in Peace Square
how could you not know it
the grass
it is quite simple
you saw nothing in Hiroshima
nothing
the reconstructions were as authentic as possible
the films were as authentic as possible
the illusion quite simply is so perfect that tourists weep
one can always scoff but what else can a tourist do but weep
i have always wept over Hiroshima's fate
Always
no
what was there for you to weep over
i saw the newsreels
on the second day history tells us i am not making it up from the second day on certain species of animals crawled from the depths of the earth and from the ashes
Dogs were captured on film for all time
i saw them
i saw the newsreels
i saw them
of the first day the second day the third day
you saw nothing
of the fifteenth day too
Hiroshima was covered in flowers
there were cornflowers and gladioli everywhere morning glories and day lilies born again from the ashes with an extraordinary vitality unheard of in flowers before then
i did not make any of it up
you made it all up
None of it just as the illusion exists in love the illusion you can never forget so i was under the illusion i would never forget Hiroshima just like with love
i saw the survivors too and those who were in the wombs of the women of Hiroshima
i saw the patience the innocence the apparent meekness with which the temporary survivors of Hiroshima adapted to a fate so unjust that the imagination usually so fertile is silent before it
Listen i know
i know everything
it went on
nothing
you know nothing
Women risk giving birth to deformed children to monsters but it goes on
Men risk becoming sterile but it goes on
Rain causes panic the rain of ash on the waters of the Pacific
the Pacific turns deadly and its fishermen die
Food becomes an object of fear
an entire city's food is thrown away
the food of entire cities is buried
an entire city rises up in anger
Entire cities rise up in anger
but against whom do they rise up in anger
the anger of entire cities whether they like it or not against the principle of inequality advanced by one people against another
the principle of inequality advanced by certain races against other races
the principle of inequality advanced by certain classes against other classes
Listen to me
Like you i know what it is to forget
no you do not know what it is to forget
Like you i am endowed with memory
i know what it is to forget
no you are not endowed with memory
Like you i too have struggled with all my might not to forget
Like you i forgot
Like you i longed for a memory beyond consolation a memory of shadows and stone
for my part i struggled every day with all my might against the horror of no longer understanding the reason to remember
Like you i forgot
Why deny the obvious necessity of remembering
Listen to me
i know something else
it will begin again
200 000 dead and 80 000 wounded in nine seconds
those are the official figures
it will begin again
it will be 10 000 degrees on the earth
Ten thousand suns people will say
the asphalt will burn
Chaos will prevail
an entire city will be lifted off the ground then fall back to earth in ashes
New vegetation rises from the sands
Four students await together like brothers a legendary death
the seven branches of the delta estuary of the river Ota drain and fill at their usual hour precisely at their usual hour with fresh water rich with fish grey or blue depending on the season and time of day
People along the muddy banks no longer watch the tide slowly rise in the seven branches of the delta estuary of the river Ota
i meet you
i remember you
who are you
you are destroying me
you are good for me
how could i know this city was tailor made for love
how could i know you fit my body like a glove
i like you
how unlikely
i like you
how slow all of a sudden
how sweet
you cannot know
you are destroying me
you are good for me
you are destroying me
you are good for me
i have time
Please devour me
Deform me to the point of ugliness
Why not you
Why not you in this city and in this night so like other cities and other nights you can hardly tell the difference
i beg of you
you have such beautiful skin
you
yes me
Surprised
are you completely Japanese or not
Completely
i am Japanese
Your eyes are green are not they
yes i think they are green
you are like a thousand women in one
that is because you do not know me
that might not be the only reason
i do not mind being a thousand women in one for you
Listen
it is 4 00
Why
i do not know who it is
every day he passes by at 4 00 and coughs
were you here in Hiroshima
of course not
that is right
how foolish of me
but my family was in Hiroshima
i was off fighting the war
Lucky for you eh
yes
Lucky for me too
Why are you in Hiroshima
a film
a film
i am acting in a film
where were you before you came to Hiroshima
Paris
and before Paris
before Paris i was in Nevers
it is in the province of Nivre
you do not know it
Why did you want to see everything in Hiroshima
it interested me
i have my own idea about it
for example
Looking closely at things is something that has to be learned
would you like some coffee
what were you dreaming about
i do not remember
Why
i was watching your hands
they move when you are sleep
Maybe that happens when you do not realize you are dreaming
you are a beautiful woman
you know that
you think so
i think so
a bit worn out no
a bit ugly
you do not mind
that is what i noticed last night at the caf
how ugly you were and
and
and how bored you looked
Tell me more
you were bored in a way that makes a man want to know a woman
you speak French well
do not i though
i am glad you finally noticed
i hadn't noticed that you do not speak Japanese
have you ever noticed people have a way of noticing what they want
i noticed you
that is all
to meet in Hiroshima
that doesn't happen everyday
what did Hiroshima mean to you in France
the end of the war
i mean completely
Astonishment that they dared do it and astonishment that they succeeded
and the beginning of an unknown fear for us as well
and then indifference
and fear of indifference as well
where were you
i had just left Nevers
i was in Paris
in the street
that is a beautiful French word
Nevers
a word like any other
Just like the town
have you met many Japanese in Hiroshima
a few but none like you
Am i the first Japanese in your life
yes
Hiroshima
the whole world rejoiced and you rejoiced with it
was it a beautiful summer day in Paris
i heard it was
was not it
yes it was a nice day
how old were you
Twenty
you
Twenty two
the same age really
Just about
what do you do for work
i am an architect
and i am also in politics
is that why you speak French so well
that is why
to read about the French Revolution
what is this film you are in
it is a film about peace
what else would you expect in Hiroshima
I'd like to see you again
at this time tomorrow
i will be on my way back to France
Really
you did not tell me
it is true
there was no point in telling you
that is why you let me come up to your room last night
because it was your last day in Hiroshima
not at all
the thought never crossed my mind
when you speak
i wonder whether you lie or tell the truth
i lie and i tell the truth
but i have no reason to lie to you
Tell me do things like this happen to you often
not all that often
but they happen
i am very fond of men
i have dubious morals you know
what do you call having dubious morals
Being dubious about other people's morals
I'd like to see you again
Even if your plane leaves tomorrow morning
Even if you have dubious morals
Why
because
you do not want to talk to me anymore
I'd like to see you again
where are you going in France
Nevers
no Paris
i am never going back to Nevers
never
never
i was never younger than i was in Nevers
Young in Nevers
Young in Nevers
and mad in Nevers too
you see Nevers is the one city in the world the one thing in the world i dream of most at night and at the same time think about the least
what was this madness of yours in Nevers like
Madness is like intelligence
you can not explain it
Just like intelligence
it comes over you consumes you and then you understand
but when it is gone you no longer understand it at all
were you full of hate
that was my madness
i was mad with hate
i felt i could make a career of hating
all i cared about was hating
do you understand
yes
it is true
i guess you must understand that too
Did it ever happen to you again
it is over
during the war
Right after it
was that one of the hardships of life in France after the war
you could say that
when did this madness of yours pass
it went away little by little and then when i had children of course
what did you say
i said it went away little by little and then when i had children of course
I'd like to spend a few days with you somewhere sometime
me too
to see you again today would not really be seeing you again
such a short time doesn't count
i really would like to
Very well
it is because you know i am leaving tomorrow
that may be part of it
but it is as good a reason as any is not it
the thought of never seeing you again in just a few hours
you were easy to find in Hiroshima
is it a French film
no International
it is about peace
is it finished
it is for me
there are some crowd scenes left to shoot
there are lots of commercials for soap
Maybe by pressing the point
yes maybe
here in Hiroshima we do not make fun of films about peace
are you tired
no more than you
i have been thinking about Nevers in France
i have been thinking about you
is your flight still tomorrow
yes
without fail
yes
the picture is behind schedule
i was supposed to be in Paris a month ago
you give me a tremendous desire to love
Always
Short lived affairs
me too
it is not always this strong and you know it
they say there is a storm coming before nightfall
IF ONE a BOMB EQUALS 20 000 ORDI NARY BOMBS
AND AN H BOMB EQUALS 1 500 ATOMlC BOMBS
HOW MUCH DOTHE 40 000 a BOMBS AND H BOMBS
CURRENTLY STOCKPlLED IN THEWORLD EQUAL
THEY AREATRlBUTE TO MAN'S SClENTlFIC GENlUS
BUT UNFORTUNATELY MAN'S POLlTICAL INTELLlGENCE
IS 100TlMES LESS DEVELOPED THAN HlS SClENTlFIC INTELLlGENCE
AND FORTHAT REASON HE FORFElTS OUR RESPECT
STOPTHERMONUCLEARTESTlNG
i do not like to think about you leaving tomorrow
i think i love you
you will come with me once more
Answer me
are you afraid
Sit down
are you all alone in Hiroshima
where is your wife
she is in Unzen in the mountains
i am alone
when is she coming back
in a few days
what is your wife like
Beautiful
i am a man who is happy with his wife
so am i
i am a woman who is happy with her husband
it would have been too easy
do not you work in the afternoon
yes a lot
Mostly in the afternoon
this whole thing is ridiculous
are you giving up your afternoon because of me
Tell me
what difference can it make
the man you loved during the war was he French
he was not French
yes
it was in Nevers
at first we met in barns
then among the ruins
then in rooms
Like anywhere else
then he died
i was 18
he was 23
Why speak of him and not others
Why not
no
Why
because of Nevers
i am only just beginning to know you and from the many thousands of things in your life
i choose Nevers
Just like that
yes
no it was not by chance
you have to tell me why
i somehow understand that it was there that you were so young that you did not yet belong to anyone in particular and i like that
no that is not it
i somehow understand that it was there that i almost lost you and ran the risk of never ever meeting you
i somehow understand that it was there that you began to be who you are today
i want to leave this place
there is nothing left for us to do now but kill the hours until your departure
Sixteen hours until your flight
it is too much
you must not be afraid
does Nevers have any other meaning in French
no
would you have been cold in that cellar in Nevers if we had loved each other
i would have been cold
the cellars in Nevers are cold both summer and winter
the city slopes down to a river called the Loire
i can not picture Nevers
Nevers
Population 40 000
Built like a capital
a child can walk all the way around it
i was born in Nevers
i grew up in Nevers
i learned to read in Nevers
that is where i turned 20
and the Loire
it is a completely unnavigable river
it is always empty due to its irregular course and sand bars
in France it is considered a very beautiful river
due mostly to its light
so very soft
if you only knew
when you are in the cellar am i dead
you are dead
how can anyone endure such pain
the cellar is small
Very small
the Marseillaise passes above my head
it is deafening
Hands become useless in a cellar
they claw and scrape away at the rocks until they bleed
it is all you can think of to help yourself and to remember
i loved blood since i had tasted yours
the world passes by above my head in place of the sky of course
i watch that world pass by
Hurriedly during the week
Leisurely on Sundays
it doesn't know i am in the cellar
they pretend i am dead
Dead far from Nevers
my father prefers it that way since i was disgraced
my father prefers
do you scream
not in the beginning
i call your name softly
but i am dead
i call your name anyway
Even if you are dead
then one day i suddenly scream
Loud like a deaf person
that is when they put me in the cellar
to punish me
what did you scream
Your German name
Just your name
the only memory i have left is your name
i promise i won't scream anymore so they take me back up to my room
i yearn for you so badly i can not bear it anymore
are you afraid
i am afraid everywhere
in the cellar
in my room
of what
of never seeing you again
Ever
i turn 20 one day in the cellar
my mother comes and tells me i am 20 years old
my mother's crying
do you spit in your mother's face
yes
Drink
Afterwards
i do not remember anymore
i do not remember anymore
you were saying the cellars in Nevers are old and damp
yes full of salt peter
sometimes a cat comes in to have a look around
it doesn't bother me
i do not remember anymore
Afterwards
i do not remember anymore
how long
an eternity
i was so young once
at night my mother takes me into the garden
she looks at my head
every night she looks carefully at my head
she still doesn't dare come close
at night i can see the town square
so i look
it is huge
it curves in the middle
Sleep comes only at dawn
does it ever rain
Along the walls
i think of you but i no longer speak of it
Madwoman
Madly in love with you
my hair grows back
i can feel it with my hands day by day
i do not care
but still it is growing back
do you scream before going down to the cellar
no i feel nothing
they are young
they shave my head carefully till they finish the job
they believe it is their duty
are you ashamed for them my love
you are dead
i am too busy suffering
Night falls
i hear nothing but the sound of the scissors on my head
it eases the pain of your death a bit like
i do not know how else to say it
Like for my nails the walls my anger
what pain
what pain in my heart
they sing the Marseillaise all through the town
Night falls
my dead lover is an enemy of France
someone says she should be paraded through town
my father's pharmacy is closed due to the disgrace
i am alone
some of them are laughing
i return home at night
and then one day my love your eternity comes to an end
yes
a long time
they said it was a long time
the cathedral bells ring at 6 00 every evening summer and winter
one day i hear them
i remember having heard them before
before when we were in love when we were happy
i begin to see
i remember having seen before when we were in love when we were happy
i remember
i see the ink
i see the daylight
i see my life
Your death
my life that goes on your death that goes on
i see that the shadows take longer to reach the corners of the room and the corners of the cellar
about half past six
Winter has ended
it is horrible
i remember you less and less clearly
Give me something to drink
i begin to forget you
i tremble at forgetting such love
more
we were to meet at noon on the banks of the Loire
i was to leave with him
when i arrived at noon on the banks of the Loire he was not quite dead yet
someone had fired on him from a garden
i stayed by his body all that day and all the following night
the next morning they came to get him and put him in a truck
Nevers was liberated that night
the cathedral bells rang and rang
he grew cold beneath me
little by little
he took so long to die
when
i do not know exactly
i was lying on top of him
the moment of his death actually escaped me
because at that moment and even afterwards
yes i can even say afterwards
i could not find the slightest difference between his dead body and my own
his body and mine seemed to me to be one and the same
you understand
he was my first love
then one day i screamed again so they put me back in the cellar
it was warm
i think it was then that my hatred left me
i do not scream anymore
i become reasonable
they say
she is become reasonable
one holiday evening they let me out
the banks of the Loire at dawn
People cross the bridge in greater or smaller numbers depending on the hour
from afar they are nobody
it is not long after that that my mother tells me i must leave for Paris during the night
she gives me some money
i take off for Paris one night on a bicycle
it is summer and the nights are warm
when i get to Paris two days later
Hiroshima is in all the papers
my hair has grown back to a decent length
i am among the crowds in the street
Fourteen years have passed
i do not even remember his hands very well
i still remember the pain a little bit
Tonight
yes i remember it tonight
but one day i will no longer remember it
at all
nothing
Tomorrow at this time
i will be thousands of miles from you
does your husband know this story
so i am the only one
yes
i am the only one who knows
be quiet
it is so nice sometimes to be with someone
yes
Tell me more
Tell me
in a few years when i have forgotten you and other adventures like this one will happen to me from sheer force of habit
i will remember you as the symbol of love's forgetfulness
i will think of this story as of the horror of forgetting
i already know it
do not things ever stop at night in Hiroshima
no they never stop
i like that
Cities where there is always someone awake day or night
sometimes we have to avoid thinking about the problems life presents
otherwise we'd suffocate
Get away from me
the sun hasn't risen yet
we will probably die without ever seeing each other again
yes probably
Unless perhaps one day a war
yes
a war
you think you know but no
never
in her youth in Nevers she had a German love
we will go to Bavaria my love and we will get married
she never went to Bavaria
Let those who never went to Bavaria dare speak to her of love
you were not quite dead yet
i told our story
i cheated on you tonight with that stranger
i told our story
you see it was there to tell
Fourteen years since i have tasted an impossible love
since Nevers
Look how i am forgetting you
Look how i have forgotten you
Look at me
i am going to stay in Hiroshima
with him every night
in Hiroshima
i am going to stay here
here
Stay in Hiroshima
of course i will stay in Hiroshima with you
i am so miserable
i was not expecting this at all
you understand
Go away
i could not possibly leave you
Stay in Hiroshima with me
he is going to walk towards me
he is going to take me by the shoulders
he is going to kiss me
he is going to kiss me and i will be lost
i meet you
i remember you
this city was tailor made for love
you fit my body like a glove
who are you
you are destroying me
i was hungry
Hungry for infidelity for adultery for lies and for death
i always have been
i had no doubt you'd cross my path one day
i waited for you calmly with boundless impatience
Devour me
Deform me to your likeness so that no one after you will ever again understand the reason for so much desire
we will be alone my love
Night will never end
the day will never dawn again on anyone
never again
at last
you are still destroying me
you are good for me
we will mourn the departed day in good conscience and with goodwill
there will be nothing else for us to do but mourn the departed day
Time will pass
Only time
and a time will come when we can no longer name what it is that binds us
Its name will gradually be erased from our memory until it vanishes completely
Perhaps there is a chance you will stay
you know very well
Staying is even more impossible than leaving
a week
Three days
Time enough for what
to live from it
to die from it
Time enough to know which
there is no such thing
Neither time enough to live from it nor time enough to die from it
so i do not give a damn
i would prefer you had died in Nevers
so would i
but i did not die in Nevers
Nevers you whom I'd forgotten tonight I'd like to see you again
Night after night month after month i set you afire while my body was ablaze with his memory
while my body is still ablaze with the memory of you
I'd like to see Nevers once again
the Loire
Lovely poplar trees of Nivre
i give you up to oblivion
Dime store romance
i consign you to oblivion
one night without you and i waited for day to deliver me
one day without his eyes and she dies the young girl from Nevers shameless young girl from Nevers
one day without his hands and she knows the pain of love
Silly little girl who died of love in Nevers
little girl from Nevers with shaven head this evening i relinquish you to oblivion
Dime store romance
as it was with him forgetting will begin with your eyes
then as with him it will swallow your voice
then as with him it will consume you entirely
little by little
you will become a song
who is she
a Frenchwoman
what is the matter
she is leaving Japan in a little while
we are sad at having to leave each other
i had to come
i will forget you
i am forgetting you already
Look how i am forgetting you
Look at me
that is your name
yes
that is my name
and your name is Nevers
Nevers in France

and the ghost in white kept following me
i hid out in the men's room
i was scared shitless
and i have a weak heart too
when i woke up i saw it
when i came to i looked every which way but i could not see it
Damn
the face was featureless
Just a white shape
i thought i was going insane
i was so scared
Scared shitless
my heart is weak
oh damn
oh damn
this is the train that people say is haunted
on the anniversary date of the accident strange things and people are seen
Get it out
Hold on
i was not going to mention this
it was 3 years ago today
it was a rainy night
i smoked in the passageway and came back in when i noticed someone following me
when i sat down the guy sat over there
he had a brief case
Reminded me of my high school teacher
i went over there to start a conversation
be careful
Sorry
Gone
the guy just disappeared
what would that be
it was a ghost
i felt chills all over
i thought i was going insane
i haven't even told this story to my wife
this is that chair the chair
Wait a minute
Why
what is it
there is something there
what is there
it is too faint to make out
do not know yet
