on the pages of American folklore a legion of mighty men have left the symbols of their greatness
there was Paul Bunyan's axe
John Henry's hammer
Davy Crockett's rifle
and then quite unexpectedly one comes upon a tin pot hat a bag of apple seed and a holy book
and strangely enough these are the symbols of one of the mightiest men of all
John Chapman a real life pioneer
with the passing years however reality has given way to legend
Until today we know this remarkable man simply as Johnny Appleseed
this is his story told by an old settler who knew Johnny well
Listen
Well sir every time i see an apple blossom sky
i think of Johnny Appleseed
because of course them clouds up there they ain't really clouds at all
no sir
Why there would not be no apple blossom sky if it weren't for the fact that Johnny
but now hold on here
Guess i better start back to the beginning
and that is when Johnny lived on a farm near Pittsburgh town
the year was 1806 or maybe there around
now just to look at him you'd say Johnny Appleseed never would make a pioneer
he was such a sawed off scrawny little fella
of course that did not faze Johnny none
he had his apple trees and the morning sun and the evening breeze
the Lord is good to me
and so i thank the Lord
for giving me the things i need
the sun and rain and an apple seed
yes he is been good to me
i owe the Lord so much
for everything i see
i am certain if it weren't for him
There'd be no apples on this limb
he is been good to me
oh here am i Neath the blue blue sky
a doing as i please
Singin' with my feathered friend
Hummin' with the bees
i wake up every day
as happy as can be
because i know that with his care
my apple trees they will still be there
oh the Lord is good to me
Working singing carefree and gay that is how Johnny spent each day attending to his apple trees
but lately little Johnny here would feel a stirring in the air
a rumbling rolling under bead of restless men and restless feet
there is plenty of room for you
Get on the wagon rolling west
Out to the great unknown
Get on the wagon rolling west
or you will be left alone
We'd little hope before
we are starting out again
we ain't afeard of man or beast
we are strong hearted men
so get on the wagon rolling west
Seeking a land that is new
Get on the wagon rolling west
there is plenty of room for you
Get on the wagon rolling west
Out to the great unknown
Get on the wagon rolling west
or you will be left alone
the rivers may be wide
the mountains may be tall
but nothing stops the pioneer
we are trailblazers all
oh get on the wagon rolling west
Out to the great unknown
Get on the wagon rolling west or
you will be left alone
you will be left alone
Poor Johnny
he weren't no pioneer and he knowed it
it was all just pretend
and them folks going west to build this nation sure made picking apples look like a plum useless occupation
Well sir that is when a miracle happened
Well what is holding you Johnny
Says a voice
Go on
Go on out west if that is your choice
Well sir it was a angel
Johnny's own private guardian angel
might look mighty queersome to you and me but you know that is just the way John figured he'd be
Well speak up boy
do not stand there gawking
Unlock your jaw and get to talking
yes sir
yes sir
Why do not i go west
because i ain't got the muscle or the breadth of chest
Out there it is the strong men who is surviving
i am about the puniest fella alive
Shame to you Johnny
you got faith and courage and a level head
but you see sir all i know is apple trees
and what is wrong with apples if you please
Ain't they about the finest fruit in all the land
Why
Why shoot man they take the cake
Just think Johnny of all the things that apples make
there is apple pickles
oh so tasty apple tarts
and apple pastry apple dumplings not to mention
Apple sauce
yes
and there is apple fritters light as thistle
and for folks to wet their whistle
Tangy apple cider in a glass Tangy apple cider in a glass
Stew'em fry'em boil'em pick'em
Apple pie and apple cake them
yep
you can cook'em many ways
there is apple this and apple that
the recipes'd fill your hat
Why i could carry on like this all day
so pack your stuff and get a going
Get them apple trees a growing
there is a lot of work out there to do
there is a lot of work to do there is a lot of work to do
yes sir
i mean no sir
you see sir i ain't got the traps ain't got the gear
or none of the things i will need out there
you ain't got the
Dad gummit boy
i am ashamed of you
you got the stuff to see you through
Why you got all the seeds you are needing
and for pretty darn good reading
there ain't nothing finer than your book
here is a mighty handy bonnet
Even got a handle on it
Turn it upside down and you can cook
so come on son and get a going
Get them apple trees a growing
there is a lot of work out there to do there is a lot of work out there to do
oh there is a lot of work to do oh there is a lot of work to do
Well sir that is how it all began
that is how Johnny all alone set out to meet the great unknown
it was a mighty big and fearsome place for a man to face
a little man and all alone without no knife without no gun
and though the forest is dark and wide with fearsome critters on every side
Johnny just kept walking on
Walked until at last he found a little spot of open ground with fertile soil and warmsome breeze
a likely place for apple trees
now the varmints here they could not know if John was friend or John was foe
so some took off in sudden flight
and some got set to claw and bite
but if Johnny seen him he paid no heed
Just got busy planting apple seed
now them varmints come from everywhere watched that man a digging there
did not like what they were seeing
did not trust no human being
yep that ornery human had to go
but who was a gonna tell him so
Well not a soul could answer that till here come along a black and white cat
now he weren't too bright but he did not much care
he knowed he had a certain air about
Well sir that done it
the critters ne'er see the be to that
the likes of a human a liking that cat
Why this little man had went and busted every precedent
he was the very first to come without no knife without no gun
and so it was from that time on every last living varmint was a friend to John
they surely was
the Lord is good to me
and so i thank the Lord
for giving me the things i need
the sun and rain and an apple seed
and he is been good to me
Well as time went by
Johnny kept right on a planting his apple trees and making friends everywhere
and his best friend was the pioneers
for of course John was planting more than an apple tree
he was planting his own boundless faith and courage too
and that give folks new heart new hope in the job they had to do
and as more and more pioneers come to push back the forest the kindly deeds of little Johnny Appleseed spread throughout the land
and more than once with a good old fashioned jubilee folks would honour Johnny Appleseed and the fruit of the apple tree
now sometimes if John was a passing by he'd mosey over and kind of look in on the doings
because it sure tickled him to see how the fruit of his labours brought all kinds of folks together and made them good neighbours
Come and get it
the food is on the table set
it is all a waiting to be eat
Come and get it
Apple pickles
Mighty tasty
Apple butter
Apple pastry
Apple dumpling
How'd you like some applesauce
yes ma'am
yep Johnny did bring folks a heap of happiness
but he weren't looking for thanks
did not have time for it
he knowed a man can take no rest if he aims to plant the whole darn wilderness in apple trees
and so it was for more than 40 year
John walked and planted that old frontier
yes sir 40 years of walking and planting
and in that space of two score year this little man he throwed his shadow clear across the land across a hundred thousand miles square
and in that shadow everywhere you will find he left his blessings three
Love and faith
and the apple tree
Boy for sleeping you take the cake
Come on get up
we got a longsome trip to make
oh why Mr Angel
how do you do
i am fine

Get them apple trees a growing
there is a lot of work up there to do there is a lot of work up there to do
oh there is a lot of work to do oh there is a lot of work to do
Well sir now you know the reason why whenever i see that certain sky i think of little John
because it is like i said if you will recall
them clouds ain't really clouds at all
they are apple blossoms if you please from John's heavenly orchard of apple trees
and someday they are will be apples there
for everyone in the world to share

it is a radio jammer
i could not understand why we were getting no signal before
this is why
our comrade here was blocking us cutting us off from Mother
and i was carrying the fucking thing
he could use it to transmit the message from his pack to the radio and
and lead us here
so there is no
no Tiger Bear no Russian soldiers needing our help
Fucking bastard

my father said man would be more efficient if they have hammers and screwdrivers instead of fingers
here use this
when i tried to do it with cats he told me it was a sin against God
he he beat me
it is not a sin
it is simple mechanics engineering
sniffs
Ugh
Well
after Father died the Nazis closed the factory and sent me to a camp
someone told the Sturmbannfuhrer about my cats
he asked me if i could do the same with people
so i used Grandfather's notes
his techniques were quite crude
he needed thunderstorms but now i can do it with a generator
that is fascinating Viktor
can you explain how your automatons receive and follow orders and
what did you say
they are not machines or puppets
Sorry sorry
l l l
Like the toys my father built
each one is still alive
i see
they even need to eat
Go hurry up
i feed them with the same eintopf i gave you
yes
Ah fuck you
Fuck you
here they are
laughs
at least one is still alive
Fuck you
Fuck you
do not do this to me
Fuck you all
do not do this to me

Come with me
Come
i will show you something else
Doctor
what
Listen
distant explosion
Listen
can not you hear it
what was that
it is us the Red Army our artillery
how far away would you say they are
1 5 kilometers
they could be here in a matter of hours
you are telling me this because
i am here to offer you a deal
our military leadership is very interested in your work
of course
i will give you my weapon to use against Western Allies to turn the whole world into a socialist utopia right
yes i think we understand each other very well
and if i refuse
we will bomb you and your army back to the Stone Age
mumbling and laughing
Very nice
how fucking cozy
muffled mumbling
ln experiments the fresher the specimens the better
indistinct radio chatter
and if i can use flesh that is still alive
i can perform miracles
Still alive
Tell me which of these two is a better Communist

which of these two is a better Communist
this one is a better Communist
do not

Hans

so Sturmbannfuhrer we meet again
Viktor bitte
Es tut mir leid dass wir versucht haben lhr aufzuhalten
Hush now Dieter
you do not have to apologize
i am going to make it all okay
Doctor there is no time
the Red Army is almost here
lf you want to work for me you need to tell me now
Enough
i said i would think about it

as you can see the two halves of the brain have been grafted together

Hold on

that is too much here
okay
i think
oh shit
Shit come on
okay that is fine
Let me fix that
the patient is no longer breathing
now
for the final step
Drei

electricity surging and zapping
gurgling screeching
it is obviously suffering from a little readjustment problem
i can build more
Ahh
what are you doing
what are you doing
how does that work
i need a different lens
how do you operate this camera
Doctor we had a deal
Listen we had a deal eh
you will be safe in Russia
what deal
i have i have people there
Orders
Enemies of the state eh
you will be safe
what about our deal
i am afraid i am going to have to refuse your generous offer
you are signing your own death warrant
lf we do not kill you your own people will
you understand that
oh yes i know
i was in a prison camp remember
but i have other plans
no no no
do not do not leave me
do not go
Ah
i will be leaving momentarily
but there should be time for one last experiment
no you can not
you can not
i can
i can
Come here
Come here
now what shall we do with you
Maybe
Maybe i will build this camera into your skull
that might be fun
grunting
you fool
a man a man of vision is always misunderstood
but the film in your camera will convince the doubters
you are insane
you are not a doctor
you are sick
oh yes
you hear me
you are sick
oh yes i am sick
Everybody's sick
the Nazis
Communists
Capitalists
everyone
the sickness cannot be cured so it must be cut out and my creations will do that
Your creations are fucking insanity
Look at them
they are fucking cripples
okay
my father
Tried to have me locked up
he said i was emotionally crippled
sobbing hysterically
i had no choice
i injected him with a drug that paralyzed him but his eyes could still move so he could watch as l
no no no

explosion
what was that
that is the beginning of the carpet bombardment
i will not have time for you after all

i will make it better
anything

Tell me what you need

okay okay okay
i am afraid after i go my soldiers may become a bit crazy
metallic ringing
what what are you talking about
they obey only me and i cannot take them with me so after i go they will turn out against each other and anything else they find nearby
panting
i would love to tell you more but i have got i have got to go
so good luck comrade
groans
the film
Proof for the doubters to make them believe
Gah
but it won't reveal my real secrets
do you know why
Look at me
do you know why
because they are all locked up in here
so i am going to take your camera with me

Ahh
militant percussive music

no
Somebody help me please
Whatever that creep gave her was attacking him
no no no do not touch him
Don touch him
Call an ambulance
what if it is not a poison but an infection
Seizing en route
she is massively hypotensive
i think we have got an outbreak
Dr Charlie Stafford Center for Disease Control
YouTube flagged this
a whole lot of you are going to die
it is an act of terrorism
Brendan Johnson FBI special agent in charge
Bodies
our terrorist is patient zero
he infected himself first and then turned himself into a suicide bomber
we are talking about an exotic virus
which are more deadly
but not airborne
People the truth is the terrorist is sick
he is infecting all of you and he is still out there
Kate
i need an ambulance
she is going into circulatory collapse
i need an epipen
i have one
here is one
i need both
both
One's not gonna do it
on my count
Ready
one two
Aaaah
Megan
oh thank God
Listen to me do not you die on me
Believe it or not i do not have a lot of girlfriends
i can not afford to lose even one
that is it
i can not wait any longer
i am instituting mandatory isolation wards
Anybody has a fever over 98 7 they cough we quarantine their ass starting with her
166 victims
92 are in the morgue
the rest are being placed in isolation wards that are already at overcapacity
if we continue at this rate half the city will be infected inside a week
Due to the good work of some of the people in this room we have been able to track the movement of each vic over the past 72 hours
here is what we have discovered these six clusters mark the areas where most of the victims crossed paths with the terrorist
we have a bank a convenience store a gas station pharmacy coffeehouse church
as you can see all but ten victims can be tracked to at least one of these clusters
so these six areas are where we are gonna concentrate the investigation
so what about the ten that are not traceable to any clusters
uh yes the outliers
i see that your girlfriend is one of them and her timeline is still half blank
Maybe if you filled that in we could discover which cluster she went to
what do you think i have been doing
i haven't the faintest idea Dunlop
as of an hour ago our body count went from 78 to 92 dead
we are going to find the son of a bitch that did this
but in order to find the who we need to isolate the what
so tell me what you know
what do we got
Antibiotics are not working
E even the patients that got them are crashing
we are seeing some common symptoms uh pancytopenia pancreatitis patchy liver cell necrosis but not enough to account for death
then we are running out of options
i have got one
now you want to tell me why we are having this meeting of the minds
Tell me what you see
Sighs
Hemorrhage
Hemorrhage
Ooh
Rather spectacular hemorrhage
Hemorrhage
Hemorrhage
Looks like we found our common cause of death
Bravo Dr Hunt
Let's not do the happy dance yet
we still have no clue what this disease is
yes but we know what it does
Stage one you think you have a fever not knowing that inside all of the blood vessels in your internal organs are starting to leak blood
Stage two now you really know you are in trouble
Maybe you you get a rash you start bleeding from unmentionable orifices but before you can do anything about that bam
Hypotensive shock
Stage three pulmonary edema cerebral edema death
not more than 72 hours between the first symptom and the last
Body of Proof 2x19 Going Viral Part 2 Original air date April 3 2012
Sync and corrected by atrn97g www addic7ed com
so you are telling me this disease can turn your brain into cat food in 72 hours but you have no clue what we are dealing with
you have over a hundred dead bodies in the morgue
can not you find a a microbe or something that can you tell you what this thing is
do you know how many microbes there are in the human body
100 trillion
that is a 1 with 14 zeroes behind it
Looking for one microbe is like looking for one specific drop of water in the Atlantic
how about this
our little uh terrorist Typhoid Mary gave himself this disease right
and it kills in 72 hours
is our guy even still alive
so you are saying one of our victims is actually the perp
i am gonna wake up screaming in the middle of the night years from now because i did not think of that
at first glance i can tell you this anyone who visited a cluster is not our killer
Why not
we have a complete timeline for each of them
they each visited a cluster
None of them visited all six
our killer did though
who are these other people
they are anomalies outliers
Ghosts essentially'cause we do not have their full timelines
Three are clinging to to life in isolation seven are in your morgue
Maybe our terrorist is one of'em
we are looking for injection marks puncture wounds anything that looks like a deliberate cut
Come on
Dani was not a terrorist
we can not afford to not be thorough
you want me to do it
i did not know her
no you did not so back off
you know i hate this
Dani dead
Kate's down
Peter's AWOL
we are falling apart
Feel free to tell me to back off again but where is Peter Dunlop
Ow
Ow
here
Let me
there we go
Good girl
Good girl
Say thank you to the lady Louise
Thank you
she is shy
you must be a doctor
yeah
how are you feeling
Honestly
Numb
my husband and i both woke up sick yesterday
he had a sore throat
i had a fever and he went to work
i took Louise to school
now he is dead and we are here
i am sorry
you are a doctor
Maybe you know
Did did he give it to me
Did i give it to my baby
will we die too
Listen we made it to the hospital
that makes us the lucky ones
they will balance our electrolytes maintain our oxygen status and blood pressure
and that all gives us a fighting chance of holding on until they can figure out what this thing is
Balance our electrolytes
that is a good one doc
does uh bourbon have electrolytes in it
i could use a shot right about now
can not you see people are scared
yeah they should be
they are dying
and newsflash so are we
so if you could get that nurse for me
i was serious about that bourbon
Really
a drink
yeah i shoulda had one at the bar with that hottie the other day
what
Prisoner gets a last meal right
i want a last drink
Peter Dunlop
Julie Tompkins
you people are so crass
i know that this seems intrusive but frankly people are frightened
they want to know exactly what their families are facing
oh cut it
Look
i want to know
my boyfriend just died of this thing
i do not have answers
that is honest at least
this hooded figure from the Internet he is calling himself John Q Plague
who is he
who are we looking for
we are looking for someone weak who hides behind masks and who spouts slogans that he learned off the back of cereal boxes
he got hold of something deadly and for the first time in his pathetic life he feels power
These outliers are gonna remain outliers
i have got nothing but a guy who cut himself shaving and two who have bed bug bites
that is it
no injection marks
Aside from a couple of hangnails
i could not find much of anything either
Well i was hoping we could at least add a couple of clusters to agent Johnson's pretty little map
where have you been
i went to see if the lab had finished running tests on those uh syringes from the terrorist's drug den
that took you 45 minutes
uh no
they weren't finished yet so i tried calling the isolation ward to see how Kate was doing but i could not get through so i
Ethan
Kate does not want us wasting our time calling her
she wants us to solve the problem find the killer
Maybe she'd like to hear the voice of a friend
so tell me what did the lab say about the uh syringes
oh let me guess
the big three heroin cocaine meth
yes uh but here is the thing one syringe had a trace for a drug the lab was not testing for
they are trying to isolate it now
Weird thing is it was the only syringe that was wiped clean of prints
that is not exactly junkie etiquette
Mnh mnh
we are thinking that syringe belonged to the terrorist are not we
Tell whoever it is i am busy
it is Kate
we are looking for a loser with a jumped up God complex who thinks that the ability to kill makes him a man when in reality he is and he will remain a coward
Hey that is the guy who beat me up
someone needs to tell him the world already has one Dirty Harry
Please shut up
that guy just lost somebody he loves
Love
Overrated
Look at them
i am glad i do not have some moon faced relative slobbering all over me telling me how sad
life is for them when i die a horrible death
Sounds like sour grapes to me
yeah
i haven't seen anyone visit you either doc
i came as soon as i could
and i i should've come sooner
no i am sorry
no
you should not be here
it is fine
i understand
i mean it is good to see a familiar face but i did not call you here to hold my hand
the news uh said there is a clock on this thing 72 hours from contraction to death
has that timeline lengthened
no it hasn't
that guy Trevino collapsed in interrogation the day Dani died four days ago
so how come he is still alive
Marcel Trevino part time pickup artist full time con artist went into tachycardia 96 hours ago in a police interrogation cell
Once the C D C and the FBI came in he went from being a suspect to just another victim
you guys kind of forgot about him
Maybe Trevino's alive because he is the friggin' terrorist
okay maybe he managed to figure out a way to
i do not know stave off death so that he could spread the disease longer
Bud interrogated him
he went through his entire timeline
he was not at any of the clusters
Well maybe he lied
Maybe he made up the timeline just to throw us off
i have heard worse theories
where
i have spent time with him
it is not like the guy's exactly Machiavelli
These days you do not have to be
all you need's Google and an ax to grind
or meanwhile back here on planet Earth maybe one of these 17 drugs he is taking for preexisting conditions is accidentally slowing down the inevitable
Nicotine patches for his smoking habit antabuse for a drinking habit fluvoxamine for his O C D interferon for a hep C infection and doxycycline for chlamydia this guy is a walking pharmacy
if one of those drugs is somehow keeping him alive we need to find out which one
now
yeah i got it
Thank you
any one of the 17 drugs in his system could aid in slowing the disease but to control test each one that is gonna take time
we do not have it
i just got the results back on the lab from that syringe the one that was wiped clean of the prints
the mystery drug was interferon
Trevino is taking interferon
yep
Maybe G man Johnson is the genius he thought he was
Trevino could be our terrorist after all
hi you have reached Gina Alvarez
i am not available right now
because she is drinking margaritas on a beach in Brazil and she doesn't want to talk to you
Dani
now i have to re record this thing
how do you stop it
Leave it mama
it is cute
Mrs Alvarez um my name is Peter
Peter Dunlop and i am uh i am Dan uh i i work
i work with your daughter
i need you to call me on this number as soon as you can please
where have you been
Thank you for being so understanding
Yesterday i was understanding
Today the city is in meltdown
so whatever you are feeling box it up put it on the shelf until this is over
do not you dare
you know we all have our own way of dealing with this Megan
and my way is to find out what the hell happened to Dani
Your way is keeping me shorthanded
Tell me something
Did you stop for a second to call Lacey or Aidan or your mom
Aidan is out of town and Lacey's with my mother
what if they weren't
what if one of them was on a slab in that room
do you think there is the tiniest chance that you'd be doing things a bit differently
Peter i get it
i know how much she meant to you
i do
but you are not gonna fill that void tonight sitting here
and right now
i can not do this without you
this is coming through the tip line
it is from our guy
you are gonna want to hear this
i saw your man on TV the one who called me a coward
when a dozen people are killed
Hey hey hey hey
Trace this
Trace this in a wildfire no one calls the flames cowards
Overpopulation leads to overconsumption
no system is exempt
our blind
we got a trace on the call dumb pursuit of the happy ending
it is coming from a bar near the hospital
Sir the M E' s office is on line three
they think our guy is Marcel Trevino
FBl
Get dow get down
Everybody down
Get down on the ground now
do it
do it
down
Everybody down
i said get down
Get your hands where we can see'em
now
Stay right there
it is not him
on the floor
Damn Move
who was the last person to use that phone Get on the ground
do not move
uh i do not know but he he left like ten minutes ago out the back
all right guys let's go
Let's go
Come on
all right
Move it
Back door
Back door
Out in the alley we are on it
we may have missed our guy but he left us a present
Help me
Hey
oh God
i am so alone
i do not want to die alone
all right what am i looking at
i sent our blood samples to the C D C had them look at them under the electron microscope
this is what we got
Trevino's on the right
the person who made the phone call on the left
not the same
i got that much
but they are both on interferon
Trevino is taking it for his hep C infection
this guy's taking a much more concentrated form
it is Human Alpha Recombinant 2B
i say he is taking it deliberately to stay alive
Why
is it a cure
should we start giving it to the infected
no indications show that it only slows the disease down
but the killer could be taking it to stay alive long enough to infect more people
Wonderful
we have got a walking dead man who refuses to die
Chin up little Buckaroo
this too is fantastic news
we are looking at the two people who have lived the longest with the disease
therefore they have a higher viral load in the bloodstream
Maybe you can explain to me how that is supposed to make me happy
because we just went from fishing in the Atlantic to shark hunting in a puddle agent Johnson
with more disease cells present we have a better chance of isolating what the hell we are dealing with
oh no
Candy canes and cheerios
what
you see those rod shaped cells that hook at the end with little circles around them looks like cheerios
there is only one virus on the planet looks like that
what is it
you have heard of Ebola
Meet his nastier bastard cousin
it is called Marburg
it is one of three viruses in the class of Ebola S and Ebola Z known to man
but this is good news
how can that possibly be good news
Well because it is not Ebola
See Marburg burns brighter dies quicker it makes it much more rare
if it is so rare how the hell did our terrorist get it
from a level 4 maximum security containment lab
this is good news
there are only a few places on the planet this strain could come from
is there a cure
that is the bad news
Code blue
Code blue
Bring in the crash cart
she is flatlining
i need a crash cart stat
okay
Prep for intubation
she is flatlining
Code blue
Losing her
Code blue
got it bagging her now
Clear the i V
we gotta get this son of a bitch
but how
Stop thinking of him as a son of a bitch
Stop thinking of him as a man
i chase viruses for a living
i know where they like to hide i know where they like to hunt
this man is a human virus and these are his hunting grounds
what do they have in common
Why does he need to feed where he feeds
Stafford
can we have the room
i have heard what you have been telling people that there is no cure
you cannot tell me that the C D C is not working on one
of course we are working on one
Right now we are concentrating on prevention
we gotta catch this guy
Well more people are gonna get this disease before we ever catch this guy so what are we gonna do just write them off
them
you mean your friend
Let me give you the speech you gave your boy Ethan
Dr Murphy needs us to catch this guy
and i know she is your friend too
you can not save her
you can
no i can not
some experimental trial a vaccine something
yes there is an experimental vaccine
it has never been tried on people
and when are you gonna get a better human trial than an outbreak right under your nose
Fort Derrick is an hour away by medical chopper
how you doin' in here
not so good
i started getting the rash and the fever and jaundice sensitivity to light abdominal cramps
Sorry
Talk about blubbering
it is gon' be all right
it is okay
my brother could not make it in
they closed the airports
he is all i have got
i never thought i would die alone
Well what the hell am i chopped liver
you are not alone
i am gonna sit here with you till they kick me out
okay
Thanks
okay i get Stafford's human virus theory
and i agree that this guy is living breathing viral scum but i do not see a pattern here
yeah it took us a minute too
but look again
all are places that have high volume turnover and only one or two entrances or exits
and each place has one object almost everybody touches the turnstile the gas pump the the keyboard on the a T M machine
one touch maximum casualties
Maybe Dani and the other nine were all at some as yet unidentified cluster
with one exit and minimal security
Let's look at the other ten timelines again
Why are you bringing your cell phone
there is absolutely nothing legal about what we are doing so i want to be sure to at least get a video consent from the patient before i administer anything
she will give it
and i just want to say thank you
i know i can be a pain
i am not breaking pretty much every rule there is just to get your harpy claws out of my ass
you were right
this is probably the only shot i have at getting a human trial against one of the deadliest viruses on the planet
so
Let's go virus hunting
Kate
Megan
what are you doing here
i am like Marburg
i am impossible to get rid of
we are gonna try to change that
it is experimental
there is no guarantee it is gonna work but
i have to give it a shot
Thank you
Hey
what are girlfriends for
i Marcel Trevino give you my consent to do this test
do it doc
i give my consent
Wait
Hey
what are you doing
you said you would give it to Kate
no i specifically did not say that
Mr Trevino's a much better test subject
there is more of the pathogen in his bloodstream
it will be easier for the vaccine to recognize the virus and neutralize it
who the hell are you to decide who lives or dies
who are you
Wow
Wow
Wow
Flatline
Let's go
Let's go
i got'em
Still dropping
i almost gave you an untested vaccine
i could've killed you
you wanted to help me
i can not tell you how much it means to me that you tried
i just killed that man
Nobody killed anybody
he was dying
you tried to save him
it did not work
no it did not just not work
it killed him
it was our best chance
our last chance
i am sorry
Look at me
i am gonna tell you the same thing i told Curtis
the one place you are not gonna catch this guy is sitting here holding my hand watching me die
no
i am not leaving you
you have been a truly good friend which sounds odd considering we have never really seen eye to eye
but if you really want to be there for me go catch this guy
do not let him infect even one more person
that is odd
what is odd
Trevino's liver
Trevino's dead
Four hours ago
i tried to call you
oh i have been uh trying to piece together Dani's timeline
Right
Your way
how is that going
i know where she was every hour of every day for her last 72 hours
that is great
all except for one hour on day one between 2 00 and 3 00 P M
i know i know
it is only an hour but it is unaccounted for
and so is where and how she got this damn thing
Well this is where it all started right here at least for us with those two
you know he kept saying that he'd seen Dani somewhere before
and at first i thought it was just some tired old pickup line but what if it was not
they both have this disease they are both outliers they met somewhere before and she has an hour missing in her timeline
not in Trevino's timeline
the FBI double checked it and reconfirmed it down to the millisecond
it is right there in his file
2 30 to 3 00 he was on the number 24 crosstown bus
a bus a high volume place with only one or two exits where people have to touch the same thing
did not Dani drive a car
it was in the shop all last week
this whole time i have been looking at where she went not how she got there
she took the damn bus
so what are we looking at
Security footage from the number 24 bus
that is one of our outliers
yeah
there is Dani
Marcel Trevino
i count eight out of our ten outliers
they all touched the railing
yeah
the question is who touched it first
i gotta go all the way back for that to the first passenger of the day
his name is Jacob Mount
he is got a bachelor's in biochemistry from state
he was working on his degree in population study at Oxford when he dropped off the grid for eight months
Suddenly he is back applying for menial jobs at the W H O the Penn Public Health Laboratory the C D C
Hey do not look at me
we did not hire this assclown
Well the W H O did as an intern in one of their facilities in upstate Pennsylvania the one that stores level 4 biohazardous viral strains including our friends Ebola and Marburg
he was fired six months ago evicted from his apartment three months ago current address unknown
so here is what we know ladies and gents who he is where he is been what he is spreading and how he is spreading it
here is what we do not know where the hell he is now and what the hell he is gonna do next
as local law enforcement remain mum about the progress of the investigation the average Philadelphian we talked to reels from shock to fear to anger to sorrow but all of them want to know who is John Q Plague and where is he now
a bank a coffee shop church gas station and now a bus
Seven clusters seven very different targets and Mount hasn't retraced his steps once
the question is what is the next target
Spin me some scenarios
Excuse me
hello
Actually there are eight or nine clusters
Eight or nine
what are you counting i am not Dr Hunt
the two remaining outliers who were not on the bus
Viola Marks and Thomas Highchurch
uh they have nothing in common
uh yes they do
Cimex lectularius
Excuse me
Bed bug bites
uh we have been looking for commonalities among all the outliers and there were none among all ten but those two both had bed bug bites
now they did not get Marburg from those bites but they did have them
there was an infestation of bed bugs at the Bingham Hotel last week
Maybe our two outliers stayed there
Maybe our killer did too
Let's go
Dunlop
you are with us
FBl
Nobody here
Damn it
Clear
Bathroom's clear
Look the desk clerk said he was sick when he checked in
he is even sicker now
he doesn't have much time left
he could not have gone far
Well if he is going out soon he is going out big
but where
he is gonna hit the school
you guys with me
no guys wait wait wait
the elementary school doesn't make any sense
that place has way too many entrances and exits
it is not his M O
then he is not going there
but he doesn't have much time right
okay so where is he going
what does he need in order to feed
one or two entrances one touchstone maximum exposure
the only one that fits the subway
Jacob Mount
Freeze
Ironic
' cause nothing ever truly freezes
Get out of here even when frozen
Life and death march on
Go ahead
Shoot
Help me splatter my blood over all these people
Help me cull this herd
i said freeze
Shoot
Shoot
we figured you'd plan something like this
do not move
Nice working with you
Hopefully the next time things will go more smoothly
no next time
i just got fired
what
Why
i will admit your charm is a bit limited but you did just track down a deadly virus
yeah and i stole a vaccine and killed a man with it
who was going to die anyway
Just because Trevino gave his verbal consent to be a test subject doesn't change the fact that it was an untested vaccine that killed him
Actually
i do not think it did
Come with me
now
something about Trevino's liver hasn't set right with me
Look see
Focal liver cell necrosis
he had frickin' Marburg Megan
the Marburg virus and necrotic liver cells go together
but what if the Marburg was masking liver damage that was already present
Remember one of the drugs he was taking antabuse used to treat severe alcoholism
this guy should not have been anywhere near alcohol but look at his tox screen
his blood alcohol was 2
he was intoxicated
Somebody gave him a drink in the last 24 hours and his liver was so damaged he could not detoxify it
so your theory is that a guy who was exposed to the deadliest virus on the planet and shot with an experimental medication actually died from a drink
yes
Your vaccine could still work
Welcome back darling
Mrs Alvarez i
i am Peter
Dani's friend
Dani told me all about you
Hey
you are looking a lot better
Thank you Dr Stafford
Hey Dr Stafford

after the Runway 1x04 Tying up Loose Ends Original Air Date on October 27 2011 Welcome everyone to our big finale of after the Runway
i am your host Zanna Roberts Rossi sync corrected by elderman
Tonight we are gonna talk with our Season Nine finalists and this year's Project Runway winner
Anya congratulations darling
i have to give you a hug
Congratulations
how you feeling oh my gosh fantastic i am sure
then you almost went from like
literally being bottom i mean it was to be fair
you were panicking your looks were all over the place
and then you literally pulled it out Nina said something to me in the critique and it really hit home
she said um Anya you know you are the only one standing here who can design the way you do
as each of us can in our own way
and it just switched something on in me
i am from the Caribbean
it is who i am
and it is when i just connected to that and just threw the rest of it out the window
then i just gave up about competing
i think when we all did that
like this last day we enjoyed it so much i could sense that
Almost the atmosphere was not competition it was just like
come on we are comrades
we are just solidarity
Let's get through this
Joshua what do you want to say to Anya i think we have really built a really great relationship despite the moments of competition you guys have still been but it is a competition and we are both Highly competitive Highly highly competitive
but it is wonderful to walk away with this with not only a friend but someone that you are happy for
she will take a sewing class
you know it Maybe from you no you know what
she can hire me to sew now
These hugs and these emotions that we share for each other are insanely genuine that was a moment
it was so sweet yeah
so Viktor tell me what do you think about Anya's win i think ultimately i am super happy for her
i think she deserves it
we all worked very hard do you think you should have won um
i mean i wanna say yes but that is selfish
but i think that we all worked hard and i think she deserved it
Like i said in my final interview it is almost like the cherry on top
but i still have the ice cream i love that
Kimberly how about you
what do you feel about Anya winning i feel like if it was not me
i am so happy that it is Anya
Early on in the completion i said to her Anya the judges have an affection for you that was so clear and that is before we even knew anything Why do you think that was she is lovable i mean
you know she has formed friendships with just about all of us here on the show
so you just have an affection for her but you must be disappointed yeah of course
of course i am
but that does not take away how happy and proud i am How'bout you Josh
are you disappointed you know when you come that close there is always going to be disappointment Hip to the post again by Truly i am like
you know it should have just been like Joshua congratulations
i am like ohh oh sweetheart if only um Did you think there was a chance you were gonna be there you know i did
i felt that i had a very good critique on the runway
and i think that hearing their critiques you know it gives me butterflies and it makes my heart smile because it is been a very long journey for me on the show how did you feel after the
Q a with the judges i mean i think it was
i think what i mean i was a little bit hurt
and just because i think that i was trying to edit myself for them
and ultimately what i had i did have more tailored pieces and things like that that i could have shown that i edited out
but i do not regret anything i did Kimberly how about you
how did you feel after you had the deliberation i was resigned that whichever way it went i was proud and you know
that is why on the runway when i said my good byes there were no tears yeah it was super celebratory yes i was just extremely extremely happy to have been here this entire time when she said her good byes
i think it and thank you so much because i feel like i
i saw how you deliver and thanked them and i think no you absolutely did Thank you so much Well it is been such a roller coaster for all of you
i want to take a look at some of the highlights These are my pants they look great i know it is a little'80s
Looks a little bit more modern and chic it is a cool vest do you know who your customer is she is definitely someone that lives her life in confidence kind of neurotic okay when did you learn how to sew Actually when i applied for this so you just learned how to sew i am horrified Anya i am happy to see that you can sew Great Thank you Anya this is a risk do we have a plan B
i am amazed at the transformation
Kimberly you are the winner of this challenge Thank you Surprise she is wearing my garment

i mean how do you all sum up your experience on
Project Runway
Kimberly it was an amazing experience
so this experience is bar none
like invaluable Viktor how'bout you it just means everything
i think the most amazing experience was just meeting you guys
Like at the end when we were all there and working on our collection
Like i am just getting chills just talking about it
Like i truly felt the connection between all of us yeah and it is just major like
i after this i know we are all gonna hang out and talk to each other and support each other i think everyone can see it is really genuine
you know you felt it in that show and you just really feel it right here right now
Joshua how'bout you it taught me that there is a
long journey ahead of me but it is going to be one that is going to be beautiful Anya how about you there is something so amazing about achieving a dream
in a very real tangible way we all have done that
and um i feel very inspired by by what we have all achieved
and i think that it is inspiring to other people too
and that is the most amazing part of it Wow well i am really inspired by all of you
Seriously
but before we take a quick break we have a very special guest
Let's welcome Nick Verreos
hello oh my dear but look at this Congratulations
Amazing
you know i really
i want to talk to you about how fabulous the collections were
all of you guys
Kimberly i loved that purple dress
Gorgeous
and that black gown hello Amazing oh honey
Viktor i loved the prints
first of all Mexico
you had me there
i am half Latino so when you said i was inspired by Mexico
i was like you go on sister
i loved all that that back the
leather straps in your prints
but i have to say i agreed with the judges it was fun
because i saw the chiffon gowns and i said the first thing i thought is gorgeous
but you needed lining
you know
and then honey
oh oh honey what no first of all no no no
i absolutely i remember when those gals came down
the jersey the draped and then the plastic contrasting
it was unbelievable Thank you and then all of a sudden
Olivia Newton John showed up
with the green shorts
but all of a sudden then you did almost a Victoria
Beckham looking dress
a great sheath dress with the plunging neckline
and i said what does that hot sexy dress have to do with the green shorts Right and then oh my goodness
the winner
the winner
Unbelievable
from that first gown that came out easy breezy elegant
Lux resort
that is all i thought
it and it was together
and it was cohesive
and like they said you had your brand Mm hmm you know whereas you talked about you are still sort of finding it
and i will tell you it is those those dresses and the drape dresses all that
that is that is you
but you had it
it is done
you can go from here tomorrow
you are done honey
it is Lux resort Wow thank you Michael Kors better watch out
because that is what i felt Thank you so much Nate
it is really good to hear from his point of view
Well we have got to take a quick break but we will be back with some very special guests who all want to say congratulations to all of you
do not go away
Welcome back everyone
now we are gonna bring out some people who are dying to congratulate you all
Come on out guys hi guys Come on in come on in
Seat seat
how are you
Come on in Congratulations Aww that is exciting
i am so glad you are all here
Together the finale Thank you what do you al think of our winner you know Anya was such a close friend so i can not help but be very proud of her
and i mean she is worked very hard it would be fair to say you have worked your butt off
Anthony Ryan what do you think i think it is great
she knows i have rooted for her from the get go
she knows i love her but i am surprised at the same time who did you think was gonna win These two both the boys had really strong collections i felt that it was not the strongest collection on the runway
i think they have all got great potential
i sort of when i saw Josh's coming down the runway i thought his was the strongest at that moment
i mean they are very different styles is Project Runway as hard as as everyone makes out to be
Kimberly what do you think Harder oh yeah it is hard Harder oh yes it is extreme
i mean what in what real situation are you gonna have to make a dress in like four or five hours
i mean it is a recipe for disaster but it takes endurance it takes strength
you have to be a very quick thinker
you know it is do or die in situations and really just bringing it up you know to your best level at every moment and making it work the show really was a challenge for all of us in different ways
i mean getting along living together dealing with all the stress
i mean it was really it was very complicated okay here is a question i want you all to be very honest about
which judge do you fear the most Heidi Nina or Michael Well um coming into the show i thought it was gonna be
Nina'cause she just seems scary just watching the show
you know
but um actually yeah it'd have to say Heidi they do not really go together
i do not love the bubble butt
it looks like a cartoon
i think that skirt is awful not that i was scared of her but she is very like just sharp and just she will just cut you down just right at the knee
Just take you out
oh Laura how about you i am totally different
i i felt that Heidi was somebody that i was like oh okay well i know Heidi will always say something good
i was not scared of Nina
however i knew she was my toughest obstacle i think this looks like a
lady's jacket from a mall
Charles Manson cult or something
it was just bad
and it looks cheap Viktor Heidi probably did not really believe in me so much the whole thing is just bad
and the concept was circus
i can not see anyone really in this i was not afraid of her but she was definitely someone that
i wanted to get her attention Wanted to impress you know it is you get sweaty up there
it is hot you know yeah that is true i actually got i would just get more pissed up there than anything
i did not really like i would not get nervous about them
i would just be like ugh Thank you so much for sharing all that
do not go away'cause we will be right back to hear more from our designers
Welcome back everyone
we are talking to our Project
Runway designers
i thought it would be fun for us all to get the heart and humor of your experience on Project
Runway
what do you all think was the best look of the entire season
Laura i probably would think that my most favorite thing was in the'70s challenge the black jumper i did because i would wear that in an instant
otherwise it is funny
i really go to that challenge
' cause i am obsessed with'70s glam
and um the jumper that Anya made i really liked that
i am such a jumper'70s kind of girl
the print was beautiful and the sheer back i really liked it was amazing Think it was great Viktor how'bout you
what is your favorite of course one of mine
Let's not be modest now the New Balance
i think i liked the combination of the jacket with the with that you know very raw dress but one of my favorites was definitely Josh's the bird challenge the orange yeah the orange one
i think it was just so effortless but it had so much structure in a way
it is like i have never seen that and it was such a stunner for me i liked it a lot Thank you that was my favorite too what do you think was the worst look of the season
Joshua That'70s challenge you know i need to like kind of
lock myself in and do a lot of research you know
it was horrendous
but these two girls on the menswear challenge Pocahontas and the old man pajamas
not even you but hers no i think my answer no
Like i wanted to dig a hole in the runway and like bury myself that day
it was that bad when i watched that episode
i was like Olivier which do you think i think my my bottom half of the avante garde challenge was kind of a disaster and Anthony Ryan we all know what my bad one was
Ohh the camel toe short by chance yes
Uck and it was such an experience
is there any advice that you would give to future people going on Project Runway
Josh you know i think everything in life just do it
because like Anya says that is a commercial yeah but have a you know it is you get one chance Go for it
Hear hear
Viktor what is your advice Buckle up'cause it is gonna be a bumpy ride
How'bout you Kimberly you need to be prepared
you need to come onto this show being strong emotionally mentally physically
Like you have to have all of that strength to get through this because it is tough the winner do you have any advice for any aspiring designer what i learned is that every time we did what we really truly believed in is when we succeeded
and i really feel that that is something that you can take through whatever it is you are trying to achieve what would be the one thing that you are gonna do now i think that a lot has happened in a short space of time
a lot of growth
we were just saying looking over that it looks like you know years have passed
and i feel that it is very important to absorb that and
learn from it and you will be back home or you are gonna stay around for a while no i am moving to New York Whoo hoo
on the team oh Trinidad will always be home but i think that it is time to take it to the next level Good for you Really excited about that How'bout you Joshua
what is next you know i already have some things in the works with some projects that they are excited about as well can you tell us anything that involve bedazzling
yes i am not one to talk about bedazzling right now am i i am gonna go bedazzle the whole country so get ready Viktor how about you
what is next i think you know working on my next collection and just creating instead of a 12 look
i wanna be make like a 30 look
and most importantly inspire people to become designers how about you Kimberly i think i am gonna initially start off with you know some of my charitable um endeavors you know
Talk to some kids and childrens about their dreams and you know going for it
that is really near and dear to my heart so it truly was a great season
Congratulations Anya and to all of you
i really enjoyed watching and
i know we will be here again at this time next year
Cheerio

Sure

Fuke
who is there
what is it that you want
Idriz who is it
Uncle Idriz it is Fuke
Fuad Zineta's son
it is you Fuke
hello my child
hello uncle
i thought i knew that voice
Come in please
what is up
Am i interrupting something
of course not
i was just arranging some old boxes
i thought about you this morning
i wondered how come you never come by
as if i sensed that
i know i took ages to come by and look at that boiler
something always comes up
i know my son
you always have things to do
there is something wrong with hot water
it sort of works and then it doesn't
it could be really bad deep inside the system
do not worry we will sort it out in no time
we will open it up if necessary
Right
Come on it
i am glad you came
Sure
i tried to get you on the phone a few times
i think there is something wrong with the lines
Really
we have been here all the time
who are you talking to
Fuke's here
Really
Look at him
hello auntie
hello
Working too hard
nothing special
Just airing the house
Fuke's here to fix the boiler
that is nice
we can have a chat too
i was just saying i tried to reach you a few times but i just could not get through
as if it is busy all the time
i probably unplugged the phone when i was dusting it
i am sure that was it
Please come in
Wait
not those slippers
Let me get you another pair
These are nice and soft
Real leather
okay thanks
Look at that
and i searched for them all over the place
you do not need new slippers
my dear if I'd known you were coming
i would've cleaned up the bathroom a bit
Sure
it is already tidy as a pharmacy
you can speak all you want my dear uncle
she is sort of careful but as soon as i leave she is all over smoked meat and cheese cream
she knows she is got high blood pressure but she just can not help it she loves the heavy stuff
i keep telling her
' Mom do not eat that you know it is bad for you'
and she goes' i won't do not worry'
as soon as i am out the door she does it again
what can you do about it up there
i know my child
when your late father was alive he and i wondered how your mother Zineta and Sabira were so much alike as if they are sisters
Like it or not they will get their way
Just look at her
Cleaning the bathroom for you as if it could be any cleaner
she is always been like that just like her mother
but since this thing happened almost seven years now since Emin God rest his soul honest to God it is twice as bad
that is what she does all the time cleaning washing sweeping and weeping
she keeps cleaning and airing rugs and carpets
no words can describe what she does
i can imagine
Just do not pay attention
i know it is hard but try not to
i keep trying
but she always frightens me with one of her
the other day every time i laid eyes on her she was putting cream on her hands
i finally worked out that she burnt her fingers with toilet bleach trying to make the tub shiny white
that could be nasty
how bad was it
it is okay just the tips of her fingers
i keep telling her do not play with chemicals you will burn down the house and me in it and she goes
' People have always used acid for cleaning'
it is these bad times they keep giving us really bad imported stuff
it is all Chinese chemistry
Chinese chemistry
Sure it is
i do not know
there everything's ready
shall we have coffee now or you want to look at boiler first
i want to look at that boiler first
who was that on the phone
it was not them
i did not think so that is not what i asked
Zineta called to check if you arrived alright
she says be careful and do not pick up anything heavy you do not want to mess up your back again
she just has to find something to worry about
no you won't
Sabira
Sabira hanum
hello Begzada hanum
hello Sabira
Why are you standing there
Cause your gate is locked
and i am in a bit of a hurry anyway
Idriz must have been doing something again
Wait i will go get the key
do not i am not coming in
i just came to give you this piece of cornbread
Real corn bright as gold
it is real cornflower
Seval and Larisa went to Visoko and her father went to the mill to grind it
Really
this is your plate
that is why i brought it
i thought the pattern looked familiar
a visitor
do tell who it is
Fuke has come to look at the boiler
Great you will have hot water again
God willing yes
how is work
okay most of the time
the salary's not much but when you look at others this is just fine
Just look at all those people with no work at all
you are right
and you were so lucky in the war
there was very little damage
Almost nothing
and we were one of the first to start the privatization
do Sheila and Aida ever come to visit
Watch out do not let the water burst out
it won't
it is not from the pipes
it is just what is left inside the boiler
Whatever
Just make sure it doesn't burst
i am careful with it
Remember the mandolin your late father brought for me from that seminar in Opatija
in Zivogosce you mean
no in Opatija
of course it was not Zivogosce
Right
he did go to Opatija just before the Olympics his company sent him
that is it
i got it mixed up for a second
i found the mandolin
it is still there
yes it is
You'd be surprised it still works just fine
i remember those days you sure knew how to play it
my playing days are long gone
Right
so what about Sheila and Aida
what is up with them where are they
they are here
they went to Tuzla for the weekend to see Sheila's brother
it is Aida's birthday tomorrow
i forgot all about it
may 7th
Coming on 10 my child
Doesn't time fly
Unbelievable is not it
i saw Aida last week and i just thought hasn't she grown up
now that you say that she is turning 10 of course she is grown up
yes a big girl
they are not coming here for her birthday
that is strange
they can not
Work is so strict these days
i know i heard someone bought them
and you can not mess with these foreigners
but it is no good when a woman is too ambitious it is just not right and that is that
when i saw Aida i could hardly recognize her
you should see her when she comes to visit
Heaven forbid to enter the house with your shoes on
she goes
'Grandpa you can not wear same slippers in the house and in the garden'
Really
that child knows every single thing in this house as if she was born here
she was born here
yes but
See she knows where everything is every little thing as if she lives here
Uncle there is something i just have to tell you
Maybe it just seems to me but Aida has the same walk as her late father
she tiptoes
it is just like seeing Emin
you are right
the image is there
you say it warms up but there is no hot water
Right
there was warm water until two days ago
it was really nice and warm
but even that is gone cold now
i think it could be the heater
i think so too
we will see when i open it
is this'Gorenje'
yes Slovenian
from Velenje
it is almost 17 years old
i think i have a spare heater in the garage but i am not sure if it's'Gorenje'
are you done with the coffee
Ages ago
you burnt up four cigarettes in half an hour
here is some juice my child
i made it a bit sweeter' cause you are working
Thanks
you must be tired
no i am fine
the juice will do you good
i will have to go home and get the heater
Idriz said right away that it was the heater
are you done painting the walls
yes
and
not bad
she did not get the color right again
the color was right but the base was real lime a total mess for two days
Zineta likes lime and that is that
she may like it but nobody does that any more
the painter told her himself
he only agreed to do it as a special favor to her
nothing beats your cakes
Just enough syrup not too much not too little
it could have been just a bit airier
no it could not
it could have just a little
i was just telling uncle i saw Aida the other day
all grown up is not she
for your information Aida is turning ten tomorrow
he knows i told him
Please play that tape when she sings in the choir
we can not watch that again
Fuke should see it
he is never seen it before
you can not see her well
there she is in the middle second row
next to the blonde girl
i can see her
there she is
they sure sing well
Just like one voice
as if it is not a choir
she is grandma's life
Strange that they did not call when they arrived
they haven't called that means they have arrived
does she have a mobile
Want me to call her
no do not bother
there the end
Why are not you eating your cake
i will
i can not just now
are you having that chest pain again
i am fine
never mind that
let me talk to the man in peace
as you wish
and do not spill the residue i need it
i saw you brought them into the house again
so what
they are harmless
they are in a tin box
it is cold at night they will die anyway
who
Earthworms that is who
Why did you need that funny little guitar
Dear God
Give us the good news now
what you mean
i mean what is up with you know
they say it is not good to ask about that
Love i mean
oh that
you just had to ask did not you
Let me be
you and Zineta find out everything
i never get to hear about it
i feel like an idiot
and
Well Samra is back so you know it is
it is what my child
we are sort of dating again
that is what i want to hear
to be honest if there was anything you'd be the first to know
is it serious
Well yes
we sort of talked about it the other day you know getting married and stuff
and all of a sudden she goes
' i would really like to live in Rovinj'
where
in Rovinj
on the Slovenian coast
Rovinj what
i do not know
they used to go there for holidays so she sort of likes the area and the climate the sea and clean air and stuff like that
that is far
Almost all the way to Italy
i know
i said so too
i sure do not want to live up there
and yet
i was just thinking i mean if that is the only way
Please be careful
you are smart but do keep an eye on everything
she mentioned this Rovinj once she sure will again
i know auntie i know
then Rijeka then Pula then hop hop hop
all the way up
Idriz
yes
Let me get you your medicines
no i will get them
Remember where you stopped
Sabira
yes
Sabira
what
where are my pink pills
in the white box next to your shaver
i put them there
in the white box next to the shaver
Why did you have to take them out of the box
it was made that way on purpose
his heart's gone to Tuzla
i see that uncle is really bothered by something
Bothered and buried alive
Sheila knows you want them to come
what can she do
she is got so much to do she would not manage even if she had twice the time
she sets things up so that she is left no time to think about things
i know but still
and this one
he is killing himself
you know that Idriz won't let anyone touch Emin's room
and Aida keeps going there it is her blood she keeps finding stuff and asking us questions
she is a big girl
of course she wants to know
she should know
it is better that we tell her about it rather than asking other people
Sheila sort of keeps to herself she doesn't want to say no to us but i know her heart's on fire
i can see it no one needs to tell me
her eyes tell me everything
i know her inside out
she brought a child to this world with our loss
i wish we could take everything apart and just put it back again
Take what apart
Emin's room to fix it
for Aida so it can be her own room it is time
i do not know
it will soon be seven years since Emin was killed
on Thursday
yes
Seven years like seven minutes
i went to his grave a while ago
i will go again on Thursday
my son my son
Auntie do not
what can you do now
i won't honest i won't
if only i could disappear just fly far far away
Dear God it is all up to you
God's will
that is all we can say
God's will
God's will and the enemy's hand
yeah
Did Zineta buy that gas stove
i will look for the heater right away and i will let you know if it matches
if it doesn't
i will see where i could find an original one
Thanks my child
do not take too much trouble
no trouble let's just fix it
Take some cake to Zineta
she will enjoy it
Thanks
i was just telling uncle
i will let you know as soon as i find the heater
Thank you my dear
i hope it is not too much trouble
you have got enough work as it is all the time
do not worry
we will sort it out
Bye now
Good bye
do come to visit
i will see you out
Let me take that
can you manage
Sure
Go back inside
never mind
Drive carefully
i will do not worry
that doesn't seem to work
Look at this
it works one minute the next it doesn't
it sounds like a dead battery
it sounds like there is no electrical supply
what can i do in this darkness
do you have a flashlight in the house
yes
yes but it doesn't work
Wait i will go and ask Ekrem
it is all because of the wheat flower
where did you buy it
at Djulaga's store
that is strange
that must be his new supply
i did not have the chance
Idriz asked him while i was in the kitchen
do not say summer holidays in Rovinj
i told him
a smart man would know a hint would do
what
of course he is smart enough
he is smart enough
here
Sorry for the trouble
no trouble at all
These stairs are so steep
what is up Fuke
it just won't start
Try it once
it sounds like a dead battery
i think so too
me too
and if we push it a bit
it is easy to push downhill but what if we have to push it uphill again
i have charger cables you know that electric thing you just plug in
how long does it take to charge
Roughly
an hour and a half approximately
an hour should do it
Go on plug it in and see what happens
okay
See how well they make them now
it is serious business now
are not they cheap
that is really cheap
around here you can not get them for less than a hundred
any colors other than brown
not at the moment
in a few days
you have shown me all i need to see
Light and good quality
are not they soft as cotton
i will tell Sheila to stop by as soon as she comes back
i haven't seen her in a while
are there any leather slippers the ones from the last time
i will ask
i am not sure though they are really in demand
Put it over there
here
Let me do it
i saw Buba earlier
Great car congratulations
that is what we could afford
where does she go
to school
she is attending evening classes for computer training
Three times a week after work
that is great
i wanted to do it too
so did i but you just can not find the time
Work and then the computer thing
how about coffee
we just finished a pot
a juice will be fine
a vitamin drink
Good evening
what is up my dear honest friend
All's well no complaints
hello Muhamed
hi Fuke
what is up
we are charging the battery
i could not start the car
do not say
yeah well
whose jump cable is this
it is mine of course
it is really good
Decent people are in bed now and i have to teach kids how to play table tennis
Just look at the racket
i thought i could give you a quick beating but this time you are saved by a car battery
11 8
Alright
Acrobat the mighty flyer never mind he trips the wire
Brick trick kick Hamed's gone to the nick
this doesn't count
Go fetch the ball Hame
the ball
okay champ
it is not okay come on
Acrobat the mighty flyer never mind he trips the wire
Idriz
yes
where on earth have you been
you went to see the man of and you disappeared
i have been with Fuke
his car would not start
is it okay now
no
he went to Ekrem's to charge the battery
he is got one of those charger things
Dear God
is he coming back here
i told him to ring us when they come back
where are you going
the news starts in a minute
i have had enough they just keep spitting at one another
you had a good team there
you remember it
of course i do
Nobody in the world had a kick like'Krila'
Remember when he whacked the fat guy when the ambulance came
down by the school
Just think about that
his mom was so worried she had to put an ice bag on her head
his mum still says that he could never go to college because'Krila' hit him so bad that his concentration was you know all messed up
my foot
' Krila' was in my class in primary school
Even then he could hardly get by
he was always stealing stuff
he was only good in crafts
you are right
it is got a really powerful beam
Dad
Good evening Almir
Good evening
what is up
nothing special
Dad can i play video games
you have spent the entire morning in front of the computer your head will just burst
Please
Drop that go home straight to bed
i will ask mom
Let me show you
i have expanded the business
i have two guys from Mostar refugees in Sweden for 6 years went to hairdressing school there and the customers really like them
that means real business
you bet
Sit down try out this chair
how come Sheila never comes to see Idriz
she does
she is just very busy
i mean do not get me wrong i do not want to interfere but everything and everyone's as close as it can be
here you see everything
Even stuff that should not be seen
what do you mean
People see behind the gates even Idriz's gate
not that i would ever look
it is the architecture
so
i saw Idriz yelling at Sheila
the entire neighborhood saw it
there that is it
Shit i had to tell you
when was that
Maybe even 6 months ago
Good that you told me
Good that you came here
Why did he yell
how would i know
there was a situation i was just walking past saw the scene and it just stuck with me
it is just for your information so you know
Did you hear that Samra's back
Samra who
you know the one and only
Your Samra
yes
Hey i had no idea
yes that is recent
she was a refugee in New York she got the passport and now she is back
so are you you know sort of something
yes sort of something again
Well congratulations then
i am glad for you
never mind that
People congratulated me once before and things went all wrong
the war turned things all wrong
it turned things upside down
we will see
Let things come into place a bit
Tell me honestly whatever it is would you ever go to live in Rovinj
to Rovinj
to live there
would you
yes or no just tell me no matter what
i do not know
you got me there
Fucking Rovinj
no idea
that is it
that is the issue of my problem
Did you shake the tablecloth properly
yes
i do not want any crumbs sticking to it
i think it should go in the wash
i called
who
Aida in Tuzla
did not i ask you not to call
i did not mean to my hand just flew
what does Aida say
she was out playing with kids i did not talk to her she will call tomorrow
i spoke to Sheila
yes
it is done let's try it
i am coming
Did you check the fuel
what fuel
Maybe he is out of fuel
what fuel
it is not that
it is more of an electrical problem
Fuel
Try now
do not push it any more
See it just won't work
this time it sounded like something else not the battery
Maybe it is the alternator
it is the battery
never mind take the cable connect it to the battery and leave it overnight
i do not think you have any other choice
Let's push it whatever happens
that is fine but how do we
no problem
if we are going to push it you just stand in the street and watch the traffic
Drive carefully make sure you control it
Go on
Clutch clutch clutch
Watch out
not a chance
it is dead
i told you
Push push all together
if you can not push just step aside do not make a mess for nothing
Go on Tarzan
Get lost
Come on Ekrem
Straight Idriz straight
Come on now hop in
never mind the shoes take it straight to the bathroom
here i am again
i just won't leave
that is alright
that car is really a nuisance
it is just old
it needs maintenance all the time
it will be fine my child
this could have happened on the road somewhere
Great you made me a pie
the garlic smells great
the oven's not that good
i thought about stuffed peppers but i know how much you like potato pie so i took a chance
Take it it is calling you
okay then i will take a cab and go home and come back early in the morning to get the car
the cab will be a rip off
Why do not you sleep here
there is an empty room
Tomorrow is Sunday you do not work
i do not know mum's on her own
nothing can happen to her
i spoke to her a minute ago
she must be worried
no she is not
Did you tell her i could not start the car
i told her all and she says you should not drive until the car's been fixed properly
that is what she said
what are you doing
Cleaning the fish tank
at this hour
what else
i work days and at night i wait
Wait for what
nothing
i left you a piece of pizza if you are hungry
they are doing overtime too
who
the computers
is that supposed to be funny
in good time
here it is from Sweden
Zejnil sent it to Idriz but it is too big for him it will just fit you well
Thanks
this fabric is so soft
i told you
i will pack it for you tomorrow before you go
no
Why should i take it with me
of course you will
it will just collect dust here
how come you came up with Sweden
Did he go to sleep
yes
a minute ago
i will throw that computer away
Sure you will
what will i practice with
what is up with Fuke
he is upset about the car he has to dish out the money for a new battery
Why doesn't Samra buy him one
i am sure she has enough stashed on the side
Great that she is back
i was so surprised when he told me
she is back only to go away again
what do you mean
i heard she had a miscarriage with the same guy she ran away with
she is here only to sell the shop in the old town
Money in her pocket and Samra's off
how can you know that
she came to my agency
to see if she could extend her return ticket to New York
do not tell me you are on her side
i am not on anybody's side
i just know Fuke loves her
it is not easy for him
if only
B H ARMY OFFENSlVE ENDS IN a BLOODBATH
Fuke
Uncle
here is an apple if you feel like it
Thanks
Look
it fits you nicely
Just look at this
it is really the one
it looks smaller now
you have grown
one string is missing
i tried to find it but nobody in this neighborhood has a mandolin
there is a music shop in the center they should have it
i did not mean to fix it for real it is just for fun
it is fine without the string it has been for years
Let me see
you can put any wire off a roll
what roll
any roll
from any engine
my nails can not handle this
Uncle
yes
you should really look after yourself a bit more
i do look after myself
i mean you should get it out of your mind
you can not tell your mind what to do
i mean you could talk to Sheila
she neglected my child
how can that be uncle
Just like that
if she wants to marry again nobody can stop her nobody can stop anybody
at least for Aida's sake
he walked her to the house the entire neighborhood saw them
there can be no such infidelity in my house
i know how you feel i know it all but tell me
what Sheila can do
she can not spend entire life mourning and living with memories
she can not marry another she never left Emin
Get it
she is still married to him
she never left my son
that is not right
do you want me to call her
to talk to her
Whatever i do not care what you do
you took my happiness away
but my heart knows no other love
Sorrow is the only thing i feel
and this endless pain is all i have
i will love nobody else in a hundred lives
i cry but tears do not come to my eyes
my pain has no end i cry but my tears are dry
Sheila it is Fuke
we do not need any more firewood
it is spring
we need the force mother
the force
Pick up some eggs on the way
how can i jog with eggs
Slowly
no eggs no cakes
Good morning grandma
Good morning to you too
it is fully charged but you can not say if the situation is okay with the electrics
it must be something
i will just set it on fire
when did you fill it up
i filled it up last month
Sabira said it must be the fuel
no more for me
have another one while it is still hot
Just a drop
some more for you
okay just a bit
what is that
Somebody left a car running outside
Fuke left his car running to charge the battery
someone could steal it
no way not here
i guess not
yes
is Ekrem there
yes come in he is here
Depends on who is wants to know
Good morning
Good morning to you too
Buba come in
Thanks i am in a hurry
Hey what is up
Hey Fuke

yes finally
Sorry to be rude
Ekrem what on earth are you doing
what am i doing
do not make me tell you in front of all these people
did not we agree to go shopping
we will go do not make a fuss for nothing
what is the problem
it is 10 30 already and you are not even dressed nothing
how can you be so irresponsible
what do you mean'nothing'
i am dressed
you are not coming with me dressed like that
in that tracksuit you look like a Montenegrin mobster
you always have something against Montenegrins
they are people too
Right Fuke
Sure they are
and you just had to agree with him
have a quick cup and then go
okay then with milk i have got heartburn
what kind of behavior was that
Why
i did not
i just
he left it running like that
it will only get stolen
who would steal it
Fuke is such a sucker
Samra it is me
i was just messing about with the car
Let me tell you
i mean
i wanted to tell you something
it is
it doesn't matter where you live what matters is who you live with
that is what i think
who right who you live WlTH
Right
no i haven't gone nuts
Why would i
what is up with you
Go on now
there as if you haven't been away at all
you let them go
Why not
they would have just died
they can not live on coffee residue forever
they better go while the earth is still damp
my dear Begzada summer draughts are coming any day now no transition time
Right
Thanks
it is the same cake from yesterday
what are you doing now
i just want to give him two fresh pieces
These went dry in the night
how could they go dry
it is not the middle of the summer nights are not that warm
on the contrary the atmosphere is sort of fresh in the evening
where did this plate come from
i have almost forgotten all about it
Begzada gave it to me a minute ago
my God
this must be the new fashion sending candy to each other
does it really matter
should i return the bowl to Begzada
not until i am done
you will just mix up the plates again
i will look for the heater right away and i will let you know if it matches
if it doesn't i will see with guys at work where i could find an original one
Thank you my child

he will be back as soon as he finds the heater
you are making a draft again
i just wanted to air it a bit
Air or no air it is just a draft
what is it
Did the window rip the curtain again
no it is fine
i think someone tried on Emin's uniform
Fuke

Idriz

Maybe Fuke remembered the pajamas
Open the door and you will know

Fine
my love for you seems to be in vain
in this world you are all i have
the peace of my soul only you can save

i am a little nervous
i have never been on TV before
Really
Well you are on TV now
and where are you from Mr Destroyer
i am guessing from the outfit Oakland California
i am from Niltor near the outer alabaster tower in the inner ring of green fire in the dimension of darkness ruled by the overlords of dread
Ooh nice
and what do you do in Niltor Mr Destroyer
i own a flower shop and a greeting card store
i see
and i suppose you are looking for a shot at that big cash prize
and that fabulous mansion
yes that would be nice
one does grow weary of the soul crushing darkness and endless screaming that fiIl the air of Niltor
Mr Destroyer i am curious what exactly powers this strange looking vehicle of yours
it is powered by the anguish of a thousand doomed souls
it sounds like he has a soft spot in his heart for the environment folks
Well good luck Gorthan Destroyer of Light
Thank you Biff
and you must be
hi
i am MaIlory from Watertown Wisconsin
everyone calls me Soccer Mom
okay Soccer Mom
and you are here in your souped up minivan is that right
yeah
you know between schooI and soccer games and my online retail business i decided i needed a hobby
Fantastic Soccer Mom
Your kids must be very proud
oh yeah
Rufus Gunter Angus and Shylock are all very proud
all those boys must be a handful

hi kids
do not forget to water the sheep
oh and no swordplay in the house while Mommy's gone okay
Well as the French say bueno el lucko to you Soccer Mom
and that brings us to
i am Dr Professor a super resourcefuI genius
and i will no doubt be the winner of this race
as we all know science is golden
that looks like a pretty sophisticated piece of machinery
you have there doctor
yes it is
and what kind of gas does it take
Antimatter
is not that the most explosive and powerful energy source known to mankind
this is it
my own specially designed antimatter engine
i never have to refuel
it uses the most efficient and powerful fuel source
so what happens if this stuff touches matter
it would instantly vaporize anything in its vicinity
what is this little thingy here do
no
do not touch that
that technology thing is certainly moving fast is not it Biff
Boy i will say
and here we have a pussycat and a mouse
Wow
i did not realize that vermin were eligible Biff
and who on earth gave this pussycat a driver's license
and what do you two have to say to our viewers at home
oh that is right
they are animals Biff and they can not talk
no sir but apparently they can drive
Hey
Look at this little mouse sized car
Aw it is cute
what can you get this baby up to Iittle mouse
Four
Four
what is this little button here do
Ah
okay
okay folks
with that we are ready to get underway
and we will see you all at the finish line in Mexico
and there they go
Attaboy Squirty
our contestants are going to have to employ the first of their vehicles' special modifications to get around this notorious Southern California traffic
and it looks like they are doing just that Biff
okay
i know just what to do now
Hey what is that pussycat up to Biff
no good it looks like to me Buzz
that was a close one Buzz
that pussycat is dynamite
Well it looks like pretty boy is gaining Squirty
Squirty
no
Bad dog
oh Squirty
no
Drop it
Drop it
this naughty pussycat would do well in the pits of Niltor
Perhaps one of my stink pods will give him a taste of his own medicine
it is a hit sir
it is an ultra super dynamic mega hit Irving
we can not end this thing in Mexico
Call the crew telI them to move the finish line
to where sir
Irving which one of these shapes is Mexico
this one here sir
Let's see how about if we take them to
and here come the racers Buzz
Hey i won
Give me that key
not so fast
oh
was that a speed bump
oh heavenly days
Did i win
now do not get too excited there racers
we have just received word from our Hollywood studio that due to high ratings the Fabulous Super Race is going to be extended
the next finish line is located deep in the heart
of the Amazon jungle
what
what are you talking about
is not that great
hello again folks
Buzz Blister here in the heart of the Amazon jungle with my cohost Biff
our racers are forging intrepidly ahead through this dense jungle on their way to this very unstable and rickety looking bridge
here come our racers
oh it looks like Steed Dirkly
Ooh that was a close one Buzz
yes it sure was Biff
and here comes
oh it looks like Grammy
i hope she can negotiate the bridge with those slats missing
i am right on your tail pretty boy
oh no
it looks like Grammy's in trouble Buzz
it certainly does
and it is just too bad that the rules prevent us from coming to the rescue of that sweet very old lady
no that would be cheating Buzz
so if this lady snaps through the rotten wooden slats of this ancient bridge and falls to her doom we'lI just have to go to a commercial
she just seems so helpless and delicate
so weak so scrawny
so noodly and frothy
so crunchy and creamy
Pretty impressive
Hey
Looks like Gorthan Destroyer of Light is making his crossing now
Gorthan's in trouble Biff
Wow he sure is Buzz
that heavy metaI car of his may be too much for that old bridge to handle
Knargack the Black Winged l summon thee to appear and use thine hideous powers to lifteth me eth over this obstacle eth
Wow Gorthan that was some trick
Did you train that bird yourself
oh no
Knargack's soul belongs to that of a vanquished foe who is now trapped and forced to serve
can it talk
could we get an interview with it
i have to get going
i am falling behind
Right
WeIl good to see you again Gorthan Destroyer of Light
Thank you Buzz
Always great to see you
i would not have pegged him as an animaI lover
i wonder who will be next Biff
that is funny
that doesn't look like what is on my map not at all
oh well signs do not lie
oh darn
i just had this washed
I'd better call GoneStar
hello
Thank you for calling GoneStar's remote assistance department
my name is Dave
would you like to subscribe
to our free music download offer
oh no thank you Dave
See i have an emergency going on now
i see
Well let me locate you on my screen
you are Mallory MacDoogle a soccer mom
i have you pinpointed in a remote and unexplored region of the Amazonian jungle
and what seems to be the trouble
See now that is just it
i am sinking in deadly quicksand and i need help getting out now
i am afraid i can not do that Mallory
Just kidding
Well let's consult our GoneStar quicksand computer and see if we can not get you out of there
Simply follow the prompts on your screen
there are many types of quicksand on our interesting planet
there is desert quicksand swamp quicksand and jungle quicksand
you have selected jungle quicksand
now please choose the jungle you are in
are you in a the Belgian Congo B a Southeast Asian jungle or C the Amazonian jungle
Amazonian yeah
now choose what you would like to do with the quicksand you have selected
would you like to a make quicksand B garden with quicksand or C get out of quicksand
oh phooey
to get out press
Wait a ding dang minute here
you know i think somebody might've done this on purpose
oh no do not go that way little mouse
the race is this way yeah
my van sank in the quicksand so i guess i am out
here have an orange
it will give you energy
Good luck
Too bad about Soccer Mom Buzz
yes i was kind of rooting for her
but what is this
that crazy pussycat has stopped at the end of the bridge
he is got a saw
i sense a dirty trick coming up
Ooh looks like that one backfired on the pussycat
it sure does Buzzalito
and this river is infested with pussycat eating piranha fish
that is Tierra del Fuego sir
and that
that would be the Antarctic sir
Fantastic
the racers will have to modify their cars and sail across water to make it there
that should boost the ratings even higher
Folks i have just heard from Hollywood and have received some terrific news that i am sure our racers will be pleased to hear
our racers are now going to head for the southernmost tip of South America where they wiIl prepare for the difficult crossing from Cape Horn to the Antarctic
and won't our racers be excited and happy to hear that
and here they come
Give me that key
oh ho ho
not so fast Steed
Biff has some news for you all
that is right all
the race has been extended
and we wiIl see each and all of you in the Antarctic
Good luck everyone
Avast Squirty
it will take more than a little drizzle to keep us from winning
Arr
Ah this reminds me of sailing Blood Blister Bay back in Niltor
Ew
no this is terrible
Stop sinking
Well maybe this is not so bad after aIl
Well Miss Mermaid you are in Iuck
because Steed Dirkly has just washed upon your shore
and as soon as you dry these damp clothes i will reward you by letting you fix my dinner
Arrgh
Hey this just in Biffo
oh some disappointing news from the Southern Atlantic
it seems Steed Dirkly is being parboiled in a briny bouillabaisse and served with a caper dill cream mousseline
Ooh Buzzby he is out of the race
but he sounds delicious
Well Gorthan congratulations on being the first one to make it to the Antarctic
Thank you Buzz
and hello Biff
Say Gorthan have you ever heard that thing about sticking your tongue on a piece of frozen metal
no
what do you mean
Well Gorthan they say if you touch your tongue on a frozen piece of metal it wiIl stick
what
yes
what do you think Gorthan
WiIl it stick yes or no
Well no that is nonsense
the answer is no
it would not stick
Well what about putting your money where your mouth is Gorthan
what do you mean
Well we have the South Pole right here
Why not give it a try
what
you mean stick my tongue on this stupid metal pole here
who would have thought that the so called Destroyer of Light
was really just a big wimp
Look i am warning you
no need to resort to evil magic Gorthan
if you think your tongue won't stick just go ahead and show us
oh all right
if only to prove to you mortals that you are wrong
here
Well go on Gorthan
i am doing it i am doing it
there
you see
i told you
Told you
i knew it
Hey Buzz look
the ice is cracking
Gosh you are right Biff O Rama
Let's hop over to safety
Hey what about me
Come on fellas
and it looks like Gorthan is out of the race
it sure does Buzzo
but at least we proved once and for all that your tongue will stick
to a metal pole if it is cold enough
and that is something
i curse your souls mortals
Boy somebody sure is a sore loser
that leaves the pussycat the mouse and of course Grammy
yes
and here they are
Let's have a word with Grammy
Say Grammy i am sure the folks at home would like to know how you feeI about the race thus far
Well it is a wonderful competition
it is good for a person to participate in old fashioned clean wholesome fun
Ah
Squirty
Squirty
Grammy's coming
Mr Pussycat how are you going to sleep at night after a rotten trick like that
i think he will sleep just fine Buzz
Looks like the pussycat is in the lead
Well it seems we are down to only two competitors now Biffy
that is right
a cat and a mouse
a predator and the prey
the overdog and the underdog
the eater and the eaten
the big and the small
okay Biff i think we get the idea
Ah
Just take a look at the ratings for the show sir
Holy cow they are through the roof
if this doesn't make me vice president of Hollywood i do not know what will
we gotta keep this up
what can we do to make the show more exciting
where are they
they are racing across the Antarctic
the next stop is Australia
Australia huh
is not that where Mozart is from
no
that is Austria sir
oh right
so how should we have them get there
Well standard procedure is to fly or sail sir
you gotta learn how to think out of the box lrving
but how else would they get there
there is an enormous body of water
between the Antarctic and Australia
Precisely
you mean
yes keep going
Underwater sir
Bingo
that is the kind of thinking that will keep you out of the mailroom
the leg of the race between Antarctica and Australia will be held underwater
it will be a television first
Let's just see how high we can get these ratings to go
Well i see the mouse Buzz but no sign of the pussyc
Wait
his car is there but the pussycat is not in the vehicle
as we all know the contestant must be in his vehicle in order to stay in the race
Congratulations Mr Mouse
you have taken the lead
you are that much closer to owning your very own mansion
now it is time to modify your vehicle because the next leg of the race to Australia is taking place
Underwater
Ooh tough break for the pussycat
yes cats do not like water at aIl
Especially this one
Mr Globwobbler sir the pussycat is out of the race
i love that cat
that backstabbing feline drove our ratings through the roof
Get him back in the race
yes sir
Take it easy Punchy
oh we are on
oh
Gee'day all you mates and sheilas
we are here
Biff no it is g'day
Like duh you pronounce the guh sound
Guh duh juh guh uh
Well now i am all self conscious and it sounds weird to me
i think you better do it
all right
then here you take Punchy
i do not think this kangaroo likes me very much Buzz
Nonsense
Take the leash
G'day folks
we are here down under in beautiful hot humid bug infested Australia
and folks say hello to our Australian ambassador of good will Punchy the boxing kangaroo
is not he cute folks
he is adorable
Juh'day
the next portion of the race will take place in the rugged outback
is not that right Biff
then on north up to Weipa in the northernmost portion of Australia
the next leg of our race is about to begin
here they come
it looks like Grammy
yes
and that is amazing
because the last time we saw her she had been eaten by a whale
never underestimate the elderly Buzz
Especially Grammy
no sir
this old bat is full of surprises
Hey it is the mouse
any sign of the pussycat Mr Mouse
i think it is curtains for the pussycat Buzz
and that is too bad
his rotten attitude was making this race so exciting
Well good luck rodent
oh my little spud
i love you
Let's burn rubber Squirty
Wait a minute Biff what is that
Well Biff it looks like the network has taken a liking to a certain pussycat
Why bother
he can not win
Grammy and the rodent are already halfway across Australia
yes
i think we can stick a fork in the pussycat because he is toast
and so is his car
Well it is always encouraging to see a guy who won't give up
yes
but this case is hopeless
there is no way the pussycat will be able to make up the gap between the mouse and Grammy
yes
He'd pretty much have to saw the entire continent of Australia in half
and that is extremely unlikely
Well I'lI be a monkey's uncle
no
he is not gonna
he sure is gonna
that crazy pussycat is going to saw Australia in half
how about that folks
that is some determined pussycat
i will say Biff
We'd better get off this continent before it sinks to the bottom of Davy Jones' Locker
oh you rotten dirty pussycat
Well it serves you right you naughty pussycat
Ah
Wahoo
Ooh
we are going down Squirty
Quick the parachutes
Why you ungratefuI little stinker
if it weren't for me you'd still be at the animal testing lab having antiperspirant sprayed in your eyes and drinking paint
Geronimo
Ooh
Open the chute Squirty
Open the chute
oh Squirty i can not
Ah
Sir Grammy is out of the race
the pussycat did her in
it is just him and the mouse now
this whole caper is falling apart
Listen up Irving
this race is taking too long
the public have the attention span of a cocker spaniel
You'd better speed up the last leg of the race or your sorry butt goes bye bye
but we told the public this race would go through the greatest cities in the world
and we haven't even been to Cleveland yet
Irving the public doesn't want a bunch of pretty cities
they want action
Action and plenty of explosions
now i want this race wrapped up in five minutes Irving
or you will find yourself sorting mail
yes sir
Well it looks like the lower life forms have taken the lead
that is right Buzz Buzz and just as well
i think they have done something for the self esteem of fur covered animals everywhere
Tom and Jerry as the only surviving drivers in our Super Race we are giving you two nuclear powered rocket car jet plane hovercraft things
and there is a teensy change in plans
you have only got five minutes to finish the race
that is right
Once you racers leave Borneo you'lI cross Europe and the Atlantic Ocean to the good old U S of a
there you will cross the continent to reach the finish line in Hollywood California in five minutes
so good luck
and may the best lower species win
Hm
Biffette we are here at the finish Iine where the crowd waits anxiously to see if the winner will be the cat or the mouse
Holy smokes folks
we can hear them heading right this way
they are neck and neck
is not that right Biff
that is right
i too can hardly speak anything articulate with all this excitement
at those speeds how long do you think it will take them to reach the finish line
i am with you
it is hard to form even a simple sentence with this excitement
but who will win
the cat or the mouse
Feline or rodent
Pet or pest
the couch scratcher or the cheese nibbler
who Biff who
and here they come folks
what an incredible final lap
Right Biffaroni
and they are a mere 5 feet from the finish line
and in the lead is Tom
no Jerry
no Tom
no Jerry
Tom
Jerry
Tom
Jerry
Tom
Jer
T
J
Tuh
Juh
it is a tie
Congratulations boys
i have got good news and bad news
the good news is you just finished the most spectacular race in history
the bad news is it is a tie
and your contract says you will both have to do the race aIl over again
huh
Ugh
from now on Hollywood is going to stand for morality wholesomeness good clean family entertainment
what is gotten into him
we can not have that kind of attitude in Hollywood
Well today is your lucky day Irving
or should i say new head of Globwobbler Studios
Gosh
Head of Globwobbler Studios
Well how nice of you to get me a new home since you wrecked my old one
and while we are
Tom there is that mouse again
Get that mouse out of our house
Well do not just stand there do something
Get going
Go on hurry
Get that mouse out
English US SDHand resistance by the Korean people brings the advance to a halt
what a wonderful taste
it is
the southern barbarians are forbidden meat on a festival they call temporas
on that day they fry fish in oil
Lord Tokugawa certainly seems to like it
one does not taste things like this in the rustic eastern provinces
i will not forget this so long as i live
is Lady Yodogimi unwell
she carries my child
this is marvelous news
Yodogimi is again with child
in truth
Milord has missed his chance
and so
if the Taiko has an heir Lord Tokugawa bids us bide our time
has his Lordship changed his mind
yes
he has resolved to out live the Taiko
he is studying the botanical writings of the physician Dosan
' the herb of long life'
he leaves nothing to chance does he
if you would
Somebody
Come quickly
it is the Master
August 1593 Death of Imai Sokyu aged 74
who is it
Approach as you will
you did well to find me
i knew as soon as you vanished from the capital
Why did you not come sooner
Hideyoshi will be a father
with Yodogimi
if the Taiko has an heir the lords gain nothing by plotting against him
and our task
we are to cease
Hmm
on whose orders was it that Sokyu died
Enough deception
what does it matter
Killing the Taiko was never simply another job
you must not go back
Dogen and the men of Koga are waiting
my death is my own affair
so is the man who killed Sokyu
what did you say
you must not go back
Run away with me
you did this
if you will not go with me i cannot let you go back
not even time for a final tryst
do you mean those words
You'd stab me then anyway
you won't steal Juzo from me
Trifling with a young girl
Shame on you Juzo
with his invasion of China stalled in Korea Hideyoshi is blessed with a long awaited heir
Osaka Castle
in his joy he moves Yodogimi and her child into Osaka Castle and to mend relations with his childless wife arranges a great cherry blossom viewing party in the hills of Yoshino
not content with the blossoms of Yoshino he continues on to the temples of Mt Koya and performs a Noh play of his own composition at Seiganji Temple final resting place of his late mother
Music and singing in a holy place like this
the Buddha will be angry
what a pity
we have missed our chance
while we live we can still strike
at least Gohei did not appear
no
he is out there in the dark
we should separate
Take the others and go on ahead
Gohei
Hideyoshi is blessed with great luck
Gohei join with us
before ambition casts you into hell
where is the evil in wanting to rise in the world
Why waste my life under the spell of Iga
and what of honor
Honor
in what lays an outlaw's honor
i would rather hell than a tedious heaven
where are you going Kuroami
you run quickly
that is bad for an old man's health
Make demons submit and enemies scatter
Rin
Pyo
to
Sha
Kai
Jin
Retsu
Zai
Zen
no
Take him alive
Stand back
Koga is blessed
Nobunaga did not kill your young
Iga is naught but old men
Kill me
a woman
' Tis a fine smell
Run girl run
i will send you to the one you love
Juzo
yes
Tsuzura Juzo of Iga
Come to take revenge
i knew you'd come
Rin
Pyo
to
Sha
Kai
Jin
Retsu
Zai
Zen
Juzo do not kill me
Help me
what
you have won
do you fear death
of course
as of this night i will cease my work
at home two women await me
without me they cannot live
Let me go back to Koga
Let your women care for you then
i give you no thanks
have that seen to or you will die
Marishiten Dogen does not faint at wounds like this
i have used your weakness of heart to beg for my life
in this contest you have lost
you have not the heart to make an end to my life
Farewell
Milady
Prepare him a bed
no
do you know what this man is
i do
you are a fool
You'd sleep with our enemy
Forgive me
how long have i slept
this is the second night
i had a dream
you were in it from beginning to end
my life is yours
do with me as you will
do you speak from your heart
my heart
my heart
since childhood i have trained as a ninja
does it hurt
i have become so many people i do not know which is myself
Ask not after my heart
you are a ninja as well
Your heart has been stolen too
you search for your heart in the same darkness
i am no ninja
i am the child of Sasaki Yoshitaka late Constable of Omi
when our house was destroyed i was taken in by the Mochizuki family of Koga
that is the story you were told by Imai Sokyu
Sasaki Yoshitaka left no child
Your birth your parents and even your heart were stolen so you could be used
who made you a ninja
Fool
if Dogen was Mitsunari's spy there will be no end of trouble
Why did you act without my orders
Dogen was killed by a man of Iga Tsuzura Juzo
you arrested him of course
Unfortunately he escaped
are you nothing but talk
you may withdraw
Leave i said
can you not hear
Tsuzura Juzo was commissioned by Imai Sokyu to kill the Taiko
behind Sokyu i think
was whom
Lord Tokugawa
what
but Lord Tokugawa has had a change of heart
because now with an heir the Taiko's line will continue
Exactly Milord
if the Taiko has a successor the lords he created will stay quiet
the ailment that killed Sokyu will spread to all who know of the plot
that is true
but were Tsuzura Juzo in your hands you could use him against both Lords Mitsunari and Tokugawa
you speak well
Capture him and your stipend will be raised to 1000 koku
but until Tsuzura Juzo is yours Gero Shobei is not of this house
Remember that
here you are
what are you doing
will you go then
Why must you go
Did you not say your life was mine
yes
i gain nothing from killing Hideyoshi
Revenge is meaningless
but i have no skill to free my fate
you do
you can run away with me
i have my task
without it i have nothing to call myself
if i do not return keep this in memory of me
i need no keepsakes
my death is not certain
if i live i will come back to you
Fushimi
Welcome
a guest
you have been most kind
Thank you very much
Take care
oh i am sorry
the boat for Osaka has just sailed
we have a horse
Ride that
i need no horse
would you break our bones
i am sorry
i apologize
now let me pass
i will not
not if it means my life
Either ride our horse or buy us a drink
Hold
Stop
Stop
what is the meaning of this unspeakable behavior
Begone
you are dressed as a merchant but you fight like a samurai
i take you for a man of position
i am Ueno Yahei Warden of these streets
may i have your name
i am a man of no exploits
i have reasons to appear like this
that is unfortunate
i must ask you to come with me and tell your story at the guardhouse
that i cannot do
that i regret is my duty
if my name suffice you shall have it
that will do
i am Ishikawa Goemon
Ishikawa Goemon
by your leave
Take that
what was that noise
Just the wind
will you not wake
i do not know you
are you really Hideyoshi
i am indeed
be silent
or cry out if you will
i will kill you when you do
what
Why do you laugh
are you so pleased at creeping in here
you are so old
Why have you come
to kill you
i am ruler over all the 60 provinces
Take care in what you say
Your life is in my hands
i value my life
my heart goes out to you
i did not think to find the Taiko so old and feeble
it is cruel to put you to the sword
as you say
what does it profit you to kill me
but this is my task
who employed you
at first i was employed but now i am not
i do this for myself
if that be the case spare me
before you is merely an old man
but that will not content me
and what will
Your thanks for not killing you
what
i have risked my life to come here
i am not likely to leave this place alive
i require your gratitude
no one must know
that i cannot promise
then i will not speak
if you will not i have no choice
Wait
Please
before i die let me ask did Tokugawa send you
no
i serve those troubled by your foolish and pointless war in Korea
so even the bandits think that was the work of one old fool
Let me tell you what happened
all i had to do was drop a hint to set the hearts of those wanting war alight with a flame so fierce the Taiko himself could not dampen it
do you think an army of 500 000 gathers simply at the order of one old man like me
i am no more than the wishes and acts of this world played by a man named Hideyoshi
if i go against this world someone else will simply be set up in my place
that is the truth of political power
Exactly who i may be i have no idea
Let me ask you
who am i
Am i really the man named Hideyoshi
Life is a dream within a dream
if i should die this world will not change at all
this from a man who rules this world
what irony
what pathos
what karma
' a dream within a dream'
if so you should sleep again and dream what i dream the endless nightmare of a bandit
what a farce
what will you do
i must ask you to close your eyes
i have enjoyed these years of pursuing you
but all you have from me is a sudden blow of my fist
Just desserts for us both
i knew you'd come out here
do not interfere
Tonight i cannot let you go
i have no future if i fail now
Find him
Find him
where did he go
he is in the moat
Hurry
there
there he is
Villain
Come quietly
i am no villain
Hidden in the moat of Fushimi Castle at night
i am Gero Shobei in the service of Lord Maeda Gen'i
what business has Lord Maeda's man here
i have reason but this is not the time
the real villain is still here
he will use this diversion to make his escape
there is a place where you can tell all
Leave the other
i am a Magistrate's official in pursuit an intruder who threatens the Taiko
you will rue this day
Come along
i assume you have an answer from Lord Maeda
what i have said was the truth
Lord Maeda has replied
' Concerning the recent intruder at Fushimi Castle called Gero Shobei
' the Maeda Household has no retainer of that name
' and further employs no spies nor engages in plots of any kind
' we beg your kind indulgence
Yours respectfully'
there is no mistake
this is the man i saw dressed as a merchant near the Taiko's castle
his name was Ishikawa Goemon
is this the man Milord
Gen'i
this is the man whose bandit gang has terrorized Kyoto
that infamous villain Ishikawa Goemon
he claims to be a spy of yours
that is an outrage
this is the man who attacked me in my bedroom
Am i to die thus without even a name
i am who i am
who is it says i am not
Gen'i
Hideyoshi
i am become a demon in life and curse you till the laws of Buddha shall crumble away
Let all the world know the fate of those who disturb my rule
Take Ishikawa Goemon his family and followers and gather a crowd at the Sanjo execution ground
that is Ishikawa Goemon
what an ogre
they are going to fry him in oil and he doesn't even turn a hair
they say when he crept into the Taiko's bedroom a stuffed plover sang out to warn him
Truly the Taiko is a great man
Raise him up
they have pulled his tongue out
that is why he is not screaming
Juzo
Master
Why did you not kill Hideyoshi
Kuroami is lost Gohei dies in your place
where will you and this woman go
i know not
she is Hattori Hanzo's ninja
it was she who killed Sokyu
you know too much
she will either kill you or drive you to suicide
i know that
do you wish to be murdered in your sleep
a ninja in love is of no use
Go where you will
Stay well Master
Juzo
Run
what is this good for
the stomach and bowels
' the herb of long life'
yes
and what is this
Black nightshade
it produces urine and brings down fever
in August 1598 four years after the execution of Ishikawa Goemon Toyotomi Hideyoshi died at Fushimi Castle at the age of 63
Hattori Hanzo's watch over Tsuzura Juzo and Kohagi came finally to an endBrother

you took someone from me so i take someone from you
Sinbad is no ordinary man
he is surrounded by magic
and through you we will find him
you are dead to me
Help me
Sinbad
i have to go back home
my uh bones have been aching and groaning at me all morning
i am getting a bad feeling about this one
i am not planning on fighting anyone Cook
i will be straight in and straight out
Find my family
i promise
this has saved my life a hundred times at sea
it will do the same for you
and if you have the chance grab me some spices while you are there
my brother's vision for Basra
i think of how much he loved this city and its people
and i wonder if i have the right to change it all
you are so close now to what you have always wanted
do not falter master

the House of Wisdom
my grandfather's scrolls are in there
Look
Taryn
what is she doing here
that is the head professor at my university
they can not
what is happening to the city
a long time ago this place was something else
a black temple
as far as i am aware this has always been a place of learning
you built your houses of science and wisdom on these dark shrines hoping to eliminate them
but they are still here buried beneath
where is it
the Gateway to the Shadows
Break it open
no
no you can not
you do not know what you are doing
oh i know exactly what i am doing
that knowledge
can never be replaced
and here we go again
Sinbad
what is wrong with you
could not resist it
we have a plan
to find your family and leave the city
Stick to it
do not get distracted
i do not understand
Why would the Emir sanction this
where have you been
the Emir is dead
People are frightened leaving the city
Only Akbari's supporters remain
what happened
Akbari's being sworn in today
Draw your own conclusions
his own brother
anything is possible in Basra now
Why destroy the House of Wisdom
because scientists and scholars are the new enemy
the old magic is returning
you can feel it
Your father
Professor of medicine
then he is not safe
be careful
i must go
Peace be with you
i understand your family
i am sorry
i have to
nothing to apologise for
Really
we agreed not to split up
we do not have much choice
Go find your family
Take them to the Providence
OK we will see you there
i will go with you
i know every alley in the city
would not want you getting lost
have you found what you came here for
yes
my brother had these old temples built over for a reason
Soon Sinbad will arrive
with this power i can make sure that every street every corner of Basra is watched over
he would have nowhere to hide and you would have absolute control of the city
you really used to live around here
here there wherever i chose
any doorway alley a rooftop
it was not so bad
there was life and colour
the sort of people you could not imagine
Wonder if our paths ever crossed
Probably not
i would've robbed you and left you in the dust
Jamil used to talk about opening a stall here
you know what his dream was
his big plan
Shoes
he wanted to sell shoes
Everybody needs shoes Sinbad
it can not fail
Come on
it is not far
Just keep walking
Shadows
do not step in the darkness but stay in the light
Wait
i have to go in there
i have to see them
i will keep watch
where is everyone
Come on
you must know a back way in
it is safer
Really
what you mean you have never sneaked in late
no
Typical
Amma
we should leave here now
if he is hurt them i swear
you swear what
that was never there before
now you feel it too do not you
he is come home
and just in time
Find him
anything
they have gone
but someone will know where they are
and i know just the person to ask
something is not right
i can not explain it but it is almost as if we are being watched
by who
there is nobody here
there is nobody anywhere
Very nice
Come on
yeah um just trying to get
Anwar
hello Mother
this is not good
what are they preparing for
Let me find my friend
we can ask him
Your friend is a guard
he always liked the uniform
Call me old fashioned but is not this suicidal
i will need to meet him alone
so i will see you back at Azizi Road in the old town
do you know it
yes
Sinbad this is
i will be careful
a deserted city hundreds of guards
what could go wrong
you came back to us
you came back
we prayed and prayed for this moment
you are alright
you are safe
of course
are not you going to introduce us to your new friend
Papa Ma this is Rina
i feared you were dead
not yet old friend
although not for want of trying
where have you been
Later
Right
i need to know of my family
Your mother's safe
Put her on a caravan out of Basra
Thank you
and my grandmother
what
Akbari has her
as soon as he becomes Emir he will execute her
when does he become Emir
the hour before nightfall
it is what all the guards are preparing for
it is where i should be
no
you have to get me to her
you have to get me into the palace
Sinbad
you do not know what you are up against
Turn back
no
Tazeem one last favour for the old days
Tazeem
Please
so tell me have you come back to us for good
i came back because i thought you were in danger
Your mother and i are fine
we get by
Get by
Father haven't you heard about the House of Wisdom
Scientists men of knowledge they are being pushed out
those that resist change yes
i am a doctor
they will always need doctors
no
you have to get out of here
i have friends that can help you leave the city
Presumably we have time to have lunch before they come and kick in our door
Gunnar
the young scholar
Keep moving
Straight back
where did they go
they disappeared
around the corner
they were just there in the shadows
now they have moved on which is what we should be doing
Come
this is the Azizi Road
where is he
there is nothing to be afraid of
Ah
Get off
Get off
Nice teamwork
Sinbad
Sorry
it is OK
he is with us
and what do you do Rina
me
i am in the jewellery trade
you must be very proud to have a son who is a doctor
oh he is not a doctor
he is a student doctor unqualified
we were so worried when he ran off to sea leaving his studies
Well thankfully i managed to persuade his university tutors to accept him back
it is not up for discussion
we have made our decision
Excuse me
does it make you ashamed that Sinbad would risk so much to save you despite what you have done and that curse you placed upon him
a curse that grows stronger the closer he comes to the grandmother he loves
there is a sadness about you
something torn from your heart
something you have lost
or is it someone
what do you want with Sinbad
my master wishes Sinbad to pay for his actions
for the death of my master's son
i understand what Lord Akbari wants
but you what do you want
oh pretty little bird singing in her cage
how sweet she sounds
Ah
Ooh
Shush now little bird
do not be sad
you will see him soon enough
this will get you on to the rampart
from there you need to find Akbari's private quarters
Your grandmother is in Taryn's chamber below that
Tazeem
i know
Good luck
Go
what are you really going in there for
to bring my grandmother back
are you sure that is all
you will need this as an escape route
i will stay here
it is a good vantage point
what is this place
Think about it Anwar
they haven't even asked you where you have been
Why
because they know
they enrolled you at university because they knew you'd come back
someone must have told them
my parents would not do that
Anwar you have made a mistake
but Akbari promised us you will come to no harm
you have a bright future that awaits you
Please
no
do not you understand
there is not going to be a university when Akbari becomes Emir
how does a common thief dare to talk about these things
she is not a thief
and even if she were how would you know that
they are here
Give her up son
it is for the best
no
Let me go
Rina
no
no
Anwar
how could you
for someone so young your Sinbad certainly has a loyal group of friends
it is such a shame they will suffer the same way as him
Except for you of course
you made the wise choice
not only will your family be safe but you will be richly rewarded under Akbari
that was a rescue attempt
what was the plan
Hope they'd take sympathy on you and stop
i mean really Anwar
how did you
oh idiot guards
Forgot to check for my knife
Almost feel sorry for them
how is the family
Pretty much disowned myself
you are better off without them
i mean a failed rescue like that can only bring more shame to the family name
Come on
the end is in sight
he is here in Basra
Sinbad
the trap is set
and what good would that do
my brother lies dead and he celebrates
you came here to kill Akbari did not you
Long live Akbari
Long live Akbari
Long live Akbari
Long live Akbari
Long live Akbari
Long live Akbari
so i ask you again what good would it do
would it help your grandmother your family
or are you just doing it for yourself
Run Sinbad
Gunnar
Amma
no
Stay where you are
Come we have to be quick
it is the curse
you cannot be close to the one who placed it upon you
then come to me
i can not
the circle is a cage
Sinbad listen to me
they know you are coming
it is a trap
Tazeem betrayed you
Go my child
there is nothing you can do
Ah
no
i am not leaving without you
i was wrong to do this to you
the curse
i am so sorry
i won't let Akbari harm you
it is her Sinbad
she is the one you must watch out for
Welcome home
how do we get past them
no
Just as you told me
Truly Taryn today is your greatest achievement
how did it feel as you stood there above the body of my dying son
Did you feel regret
Sorrow
or triumph
everything i have done since then has been for the memory of my son
but this
this is just for me
and this is for my brother
do it
i am sorry
i am sorry for your loss
and i am sorry for the pain that i have caused you
you have become the man i always hoped you would be
Amma
you are free
Sinbad of Basra
i am also sorry for your loss
you never understood
you thought i was your servant but it was you serving me
you really have no idea who you are do you
what you are capable of
i can show you if you let me
i can show you a whole world beyond this one
no
you won't
no
what is happening
Look
Come come
Amma
i should have told you the truth about who you are
i do not understand
Kept so much from you
Just wanted to protect you
can you forgive me
Amma
you need to go
there are guards on the way
they are locking down the palace
we do not have long
Sinbad please
i did not have a choice
so what now
we are free
Akbari can not follow us any more
Akbari was a good man
he just lost his way
Well you missed the most amazing thing
Anwar rescuing me
from a heavily armed prison cart
Really
i have never seen anything like it
she is exaggerating a little bit
or a lot
i was very brave
i hate to say it but
i am really going to miss moments like these
are you leaving
no
not leaving
Staying
my father spent his life helping those less fortunate than himself
and in Basra now there are people who have lost their homes their livelihoods
i want to be the daughter my father would be proud of
you are sure about this
as much as i can be
Nala
i will make sure your grandmother has the burial she deserves
you know when i first met you i thought you were a vile arrogant
yes
Dirty young man
and what about now
i did not say my feelings had changed
oh
Listen wait
it was fun
i mean there was the fighting the screaming the life and death situations
but it was fun
Thank you
Come in useful
no i did not need it in the end
do not suppose you managed to pick up any spice for me then
Sorry
Honestly i ask you to do one thing
Ah you will learn
Home changes
you think the place you grow up is it but the world expands
and one day you wake up
look around and you find your home has come with you
huh
but seriously not even a small jar of spice
a few scraps
Ah i do not know why i bother sometimes

when i was little
i often went on holiday to my aunt's near Madrid
one afternoon i was playing ball with the other kids opposite the neighbor's house
at one point
i threw it too hard and the ball went into the garden of the house next door
i was freaking out
i could not find the ball
i could hear the others laughing
and suddenly
she said
my name is Elena
do you want to play with me
no one lived in the house
no
the garden was a jungle
i asked her where her parents were
you wanna play in the pool
the GPS is gone
we are lost
is that it
the last inhabitants of the house were a couple
with a little girl called Elena
they had been living there a few months and one day they discovered their daughter dead drowned at the bottom of the pool

no one ever believes me
i believe you
you talked to a dead person

People go to bed early in small villages
i will go check
Wanna come with me Mathias

my grandma used to say when i was naughty that she would leave me in Ruiflec
i remember now
she called it the Village of Shadows
she said in Ruiflec you never know what is hiding in the dark
are you ok
we have to leave here David
i do not know why we came to this dump
Ruiflec what a dumb name
i do not trust your Lucas
he is not my Lucas
it was his idea to come here
he is into you no
you have a problem with that
you introduced me to him
i have only known him 2 months
he is not your buddy
Nobody knows the guy but we all followed him
Shut the door
Go and shut it David
Lock the door
what happened
it is Lucas he was walking in front of me
he hit me
with something
Let me see
no
Get the first aid kit from my bag
i thought he was gonna kill me
he had this look
i have never seen him like that
Why'd he do that
you think i know
we can not stay here
i agree
i am not going anywhere until we find Marion
do not look at me like that it won't change anything
it was moved recently
it is burning hot
i am not sure
it looks like Hugo
Your sister's boyfriend

Hugo would not have
Marion
i am sorry
it is ok
what have you been doing all this time
i was looking for you
i was looking for you
where are the others
i have no idea
we were driving
we reached the village
i fell asleep
then i heard you
that is it
i do not know any more
Your story doesn't make sense
he is right it is not clear
if all the others disappeared why not you
it is only half an hour since he passed us on the road
when i listen to her it sounds like hours
it is just bullshit
can you believe these two
they think I'd make up a story just to scare you
do not touch me
you were outside
Alone in this shithole
you saw your friends disappear before your eyes
Stop it Marion
no
then shut the fuck up
that is funny
which one is the big sister
David
you are going too far
i am right no
Everybody calms down
we have other damn problems
no
she is bullshitting us and we are falling for it
and what about that

what are you talking about
Why are you showing me that
it is not the right one
i did not let go of it
Hugo's face was there
you saw it right
we have to stop trying to understand
we have to get out of here
she is right
Get the gear and go

Why 9 names
Why are there 9 names on our list
there are 9 lines on every list
and the paper is lighter here
there too there was a 9th name but it is been wiped out
Why
Lucas is on the list
Maybe he is a victim
Maybe he wants us to believe that
it is me
the next one is me
i won't leave you Lila

Medical report
Termination of pregnancy
i have something to tell you
Mathias had this book in the car
they are all the same
Ruiflec
Page 88
what
there
Ruiflec the Village of Shadows
RUlFLEC
THE VlLLAGE OF SHADOWS
August 8 1 784
a young peasant vanished at Ruiflec leaving no trace
those responsible for the kidnapping were known to all the village
Eight nobles who terrified by the popular uprisings
had chosen to flee Paris and move to Ruiflec
they feared the extinction of their kind
and sought the means to prolong their earthly lives
at any price
Sires hereby expressly note the creation of the Order of Eight
Death itself may die my brothers in arms
if you turn the 8 it is perpetual motion
Infinity
Keep going
every 8 years in the 8th month
the members of the Order of Eight captured an innocent chosen at random
have pity Sires no
they were convinced their victim would return from the dead
bringing the Key to Immortality
after the first seven sacrifices none of the victims returned
but the 8th time
Mama
August 8 1 840
Mama
Let me go
Let me go
Help Mama
Bastien
i beg you spare me
Mama
Bastien
Let me go
not my son
not my son
Please
Please
Mama
Mama where are you
Mama save me
Please
Please
Mama help
Mercy i beg you
Let me
Let me go i beg you
i beg you spare me
Sires i beg you please
Sires please
Let me go
the child was buried beside the seven other victims
in what was later called the Clearing of the Innocents
and on the 8th day
but what returned from the dead
was no longer a child nor even human
it tore apart its 8 torturers
with a bloody rage
the inhabitants of Ruiflec
knowing that the child's rage would turn against them
tried to show the demon his suffering was not their fault
they hoped these offerings would save their families
but it was not enough to appease his anger
since then no one can leave Ruiflec
until the curse on the village
is broken
there is a page missing it is been torn out
there is a way to get out in this book
how can this map help us
the village keeps changing
there must be a way
the Clearing of the Innocents
Look
the Clearing of the Innocents is exactly in the center of the symbol
it is the real heart of Ruiflec
we should go there
Marion
yeah
i know
i know you lost it
do not worry
i did not tell mum and dad
Why did not you tell me
now we are talking
you really pick your moment
you think it is the end
no we will get out of here
you keep saying that
now shut the fuck up
Marion i do not
Shut it
no Marion
Lila
Stop
i do not want to play
i do not want to play anymore
Wait
i saw
it is here
the Clearing of the Innocents
this is where Lila passed out
Except that was not there before
Castle House
the Disappeared of Ruiflec
August 8 1944
Let's go FrolichI we have to leave this villageI
SoldiersI Forward marchI
does anyone have a light
i am not going to tell you the story of Ruiflec
you already know it
but i do not know if you know my story
that is really a scary story
i was born here
in Ruiflec
my parents were too poor to leave the village
my father clung to his land
Like a tick clings to skin
so we stayed
we were the only ones left
and one day in 1928
you know what happens here
he took them all
my father
my brother
my sister
my mother
the real question is why why did he leave me
Why
because there was nobody else
everyone had gone
so he chose me
for better and for worse
every 8 years 8 little mice to feed the mean little cat
but Lucas brought us here
i suggested this little country weekend
where are your neighbors
Mathias
Castle House is not his grandparents' house
it is my house
he really liked you
Too bad
you killed them all
i never killed anyone
i never killed anyone
he wants you to feel the same terror he did
when they took him from his mother he became cruel like his torturers
he draws well no
what a waste
he had talent
you think you are walking in the streets of Ruiflec but you are in the labyrinth of his crazy mind
in Ruiflec he makes the rules
i do not think it works that one
it does
Let her go
you are hurting me
i am impressed Emma
you have been right from the start
we can get out of here
Normally only i know
Tell me
Tell me Mathias
Tell me
Tell me
Ask your sister
you can not do it Marion
Immortality is not a gift
you can not go back
Even me I'd often like to die
he killed Death itself
those who burned him did not profit from that
but i did
and i can tell you it is a real nightmare
you can not get close to anyone

Ruiflec
i haven't heard that name for years
my grandma used to say when i was naughty that she would leave me in Ruiflec
she called it the Village of Shadows
because in Ruiflec you never know what is hiding in the dark
that is just children's stories
you must have the wrong name
that village hasn't existed for years
Very pretty

they are not bad players
but winning is a habit that takes time to build
Good Shaan
we can defend but our attack l'm not so sure
that is why we have lost so many times
Shaan is a good midfielder

lf you fellows were to give up football all of Southall will start loving the game
lt's not that bad
we are trying our best right now the club is struggling we are short of funds

Come on Jenny i need to do this
lf they weren't there then the club would not exist

Even if we had our own child
Waste your time and money on them

Just because i love them so much doesn't mean that i do not love you
Forget it now

Ranveer you should shower and come

how many did you slaughter today
you worry about the vegetables you need to buy or you'il have to sleep on an empty stomach
Hey are these yesterday's kebabs
Shaan why are not you having any
Why should l
Boys they are yesterday's kebabs

i did not say they are yesterday's
Shweta you have a great television show on football

Ouch

Hey Bengal tiger why are you so serious
our own taunt us ridicule us
are you talking about Shweta
Did you feel bad for what Shweta said
you might not be offended but i am
Shaan tell me something
Southall did reach the finals once did not it
yes
it did
that is why l've come here
left Dhaka for England
Only for football
Even i want to win
Whoever plays to lose
Debu more than football we need to ensure that the kids are not put out of school
ln other clubs they get paid weekly
here we shell out from our own pockets
we have to win one match
and look everything will change
oh no
lf we get this property we'il be in the money Ahluwalia
it is a gold mine Anne
Gold mine
Come on
Come on
so here we are
Ahluwalia here we'il have the foodcourt next to it we'il put up an eight screen multiplex
Madam we proposed to have landscaping and trees all around that area
and a street running right through the middle
hi
hi i am Johnny
Johnny Bakshi
and this is Anne Fisher chairman of the city council
hi
and this is Mr Bhupendra Ahluwalia
he is Southall's biggest builder
Come on
Come on
so you are a builder
yes
we are here to meet the chairman of Southall United football club Mr Dhariwal
Mr Dhariwal
i am Anne Fisher from the city council
so you are the owner of Southall United Football Club is that correct
yes
do you know why we requested this meeting
Mr Dhariwal
you know that Southall City Council had allocated this plot for our club on a 30 year lease
but over the past eight years you haven't paid the rent
Considering that the local community would play here and i agree with you that is how it should be
lnstead Mr Dhariwal
Bhangra competitions are held here
Kebabs are sold here weddings are organized
and the game that is played here you can not call it football
ln 25 years you haven't won a single match
it is a waste of land
now the City Council desires that
ln fact the people of Southall desire that a shopping mall be erected an amusement arcade come up for the kids so that the community can benefit from it
you know what i mean
you know Ms Anne
we play football because we love the game
Johnny you are one of us
you are a football commentator
you should understand
you are doing it for the money
Mr Dhariwal i am doing this for the community
no
how much
Three million pounds
Three million pounds
Mr Dhariwal you have 1 1 months
Ms Fisher we are not giving you the ground
and do not mistake our silence for our weakness
Explain it to this Englishwoman
they had all the weapons
but we got lndia back without raising our hands even once
my father spent 40 years on the upkeep of this ground
for the last 100 years we have been playing on this ground
this ground was ours is ours and will always remain so
ln that case gentlemen we have nothing more to discuss
Mr Dhariwal you have 1 1 months to save the ground
the price is three million pounds which you can not pay
i have a brilliant idea
the championship league begins next month the prize money is three million pounds
Tell your captain either you win the championship or vacate the ground
Good day to you sir
all i wanted was to win a trophy
my time went by and that never happened
my business wound up
my property sold off
Even my house is mortgaged
all for the sake of this club
i have nothing more to give
Wish i had a son
Why do you say that Uncle
have i ever made you feel the lack of a son
as long as i am around no one will take this club away from us
i promise me you that
Uncle
Uncle
now that Mr
Dhariwal has passed way there is no one around to fund and manage the Southall United Football Club
the City Council decided yesterday that at the end of this season they would take the ground back from the club
Southall United was started 100 years back is famous for defeating many top ranking teams
Famous footballers like Tony Singh have played here
Southall united is the first all Asian Football Club
ln 1985 it reached to the finals
but now i hope it won't be there
Very sad day for Asian Football in the UK
Shweta Singh for just football
to save the ground and win the championship we needed a coach
but who would coach us
someone who loved Southall even more than i did
there was just one person Tony Singh
Come on finish your game
Come on pass this ball
Juggle juggle faster
Shaan
that is a goal
Come on
you can see the spaces
oh
Tony please
we need a coach Tony
i am no coach
Tony
you are a great player
Why do not you teach us to play like you did
Tony Southall needs you
i have nothing to do with Southall
you were also once part of Southall
you do not just stay right there
These people do not know who i am and who i was
OK
i want to keep it that way
do you understand
Stay out of my life
do not come near me
do not try to meet me again
Tony the Council is bringing the club down
Tony if what happened in 1985 was an act of weakness then right now you are being a coward
Go away
you are a weak defeated man
you are a failure
lf we start doubting ourselves how will we win the league
and we have to win the league
we have no other way out
you are right
we have to win it
Monty you are an experienced player
Why do not you coach us
Ok
we also have Aakash to help you out
Sure
you guys can do it
and we are also there
we are willing to do anything
i think together we can make this happen
yes
Monty
who is that
who is he
you are late
Sorry coach
where is the team
this is the best we have
two things are required in football
the head and feet
the good news is you have both
but the bad news is
what is in between both is of no use at all
we need to check that first
he is asking us to strip our clothes
i won't strip
you
Monty Singh Walia coach
yeah Monty
what are you doing
did not you tell us you wanted to check what is in between the head and the feet
Monty that is not what the coach meant
Pull it down otherwise you'il catch a chill
Sorry coach
so you know what to do
Give me a 12 minute round
Come on
Come on
Alright time to run
Come on
Come on
Come on Aakash run faster
i am remembering my darling
i am not able to run
Come on brother Ranjit
Come on
Debu please do not fall
Brother Debu what happened get up
Come on guys
two more rounds
Mr Tony we will win won't we
Come on guys
Move your legs
Move it
Move it
Move it
we need at 12 thousand pounds
we can not afford grounds men and equipment
we will need to handle everything ourselves
what else do we need
Jersey and gear
this is all we have
who will sponsor us
i will manage that
now we need a bus
with the banner of the Southall United Football Club
yeah that is good
Coach that is easy
Monty has a garage
are they your family jewels
lt's a bus we are talking about not half a pound of meatballs
you idiot
you will break my bones
Shut up
Sunny is Asson a good team
lt's Aston mom
Aston
lt's the best team in this league
do you have a chance
a chance
Mom your son is the best
he is going to be a star starting tomorrow
Sunny why do not you join Southall
because mom they only run after the ball
Poor fellows never manage to get hold of it
does your dad know that the selection is tomorrow
yes i know
do you know your son will get selected tomorrow
he is the best
Kavita do you think that the English will select him because he is the best
he will know for a fact what he is pushing himself into tomorrow
another new player
an lndian player
Aston and Sunny Bhasin
a weird combination indeed
Well he must be good
of course
Playing practice matches and the championship are two different ball games
Beckham

you always knew i was not playing
it is not about football
it is about my color
what can i do son
lt's written on our faces that we are lndian
but you are not an lndian citizen
the problem is you were born here
do you understand
this is your fault
but do not you worry is that clear
Whatever it is that you do you'il do it better than the English ls that clear
you will do it very well
Football is my only passion Salim
Dear

Come on let's go
Come on let's go
Welcome everyone to Paddock Wood football ground
this is Johnny Bakshi your commentator for the afternoon and with me here is Daniel
hello
Today is Southall United's first match of the season
and we all know what is bound to happen
Southall is ranked the lowest in the league and is also the weakest
and they are singing a song
no that is the anthem
that is the Southall United Anthem
Goal on goal
Chotu kicks off and passes the ball to their captain Shaan
Debu receives the ball from Shaan and tries to control and move forward but a fine tackle by Brian
Debu is down and unable to get up
because of his body weight
he seems to have hurt his back
Lovely pass on the Tom on the right side he passes the ball to Frank
Paddock wood has kept the ball in possession and the ball is going to Southall now
he comes forward and
what a goal
the goalkeeper did not see the ball coming
Paddock Wood ahead by a goal
he is trying to move forward
and he dribbles the ball and moves ahead
he passes it once again
the goalkeeper dives in to save but they manage to score
another goal for Paddock Wood
you butcher you have ruined us
Get lost from here
you are flying like a wild cock
who made him a goal keeper
Harry passes
oh no the pass misses
the ball has reached to Jacob
Three Nil Paddock Wood
another goal from Paddock Wood
i have never seen anything like this
Harry moves around and passes it
Shaan has the ball
Shaan is trying to pass the ball but Paddock Wood trying to regain the ball and four players have surrounded him
but not one Southall player to support him
Shaan tries hard but other Southall players are way behind
and moving once again towards the Southall goal
a brilliant right kick and a goal
lt's their fourth goal
lt's goal not eggs
how many will you eat
Hey do not teach me
Hey are you doing goal keeping or shop keeping
where are you guys
i am all alone here idiots
it is half time here at Paddock Wood football ground
the half time score is 4 0
now we have the second half and let's see what happens
the referee signals the second half
the Paddock Wood forward kicks it over Ranveer's head and it is a goal
Brilliant
the goal keeper is not watching
and it is their fifth goal
Absolutely amazing
Superb
Ball goes to Monty from Monty to Ranveer and this
you scoundrel
Wife's stooge
Only this was left now
by the way this team need not make a goal
Monty
Monty has made a goal on the wrong side
Pass ahead not behind
Tony Singh should teach his players especially the goal post they need to strike
Pass ahead not behind
and the final score is Paddock Wood 6 and Southall United 0
that is the funniest match i have ever seen
there you are
Losers
1 2 3 4 5
you guys are losers
we had placed bets on 18 0
what were you guys doing
what could i do
i was the only one near the goal
Shouting out
but he did not pass
he thinks he is Pele
what is your bloody problem
you know i can not kick with my left leg
so then why play football
i can not kick with my left leg
he was looking at the babes and obviously they scored
you mean i let them score
who is the goalkeeper
you or l
what were the defenders doing
Loitering about
Please i am telling you
Shut up shut up
Behave yourselves ldiots
he was watching girls
Why did he become a goal keeper then
yes i know
you shut up now
we lost the match because of you
you only know to point on others
what can we do coach
i have thought of something
you do trust me do not you
yes coach
Sunny
hi
i heard about what happened
Even you knew about it
i felt very sad for you
but am not suprised
Exactly what my dad says
what will you do now Sunny
i am the best
i will play for some other club
i really do not know
but i will definitely play
Come to Southall Sunny
Coach neither do i run a restaurant nor do i sell meat
i do not have a garage and i do not know how to play in a band
i only know how to play football
Tomorrow if you start working will you no longer be a player
they can not take the ball away from me not even for ten seconds
that is their caliber
lf you can not tackle the ball away for ten minutes will you play for Southall
who is going to stop me
Tomorrow
when do i need to reach coach
this is not just a game for us
lt's a fight to save our home we have to win this fight
Anyhow
though we will now be playing this match for a draw
0 0
lf we can not score we also do not let them score
the ball should not get into the net
are you with me
yes
Shaan

Coach you are making a big mistake
Sorry but l'm not here to solve your personal problems

Shit

Fine ls Tony there

Sure
Coach Sunny will break the team
he could not be faithful to his parents his community
how can he be a part of us
he is the sort who will betray those that feed him
he is not one of us
Nor can he ever be
Neither does he want to be a part of us
how can we play together coach
this bouquet of different flowers kept together looks very pretty doesn't it
Sit down Shaan
Shaan
you are the captain
you decided to make me the coach
now too the decision is yours
you decide who stays and who doesn't
you decide
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Southall United Football Club

Sunny

Hell
and that is the end of first half
Southall has missed a huge opportunity get back to where did you come from
Paki
we will see who goes
Shaan you'il need to run faster
lnstead of speed alone if you would've used your head you could've seen me
Guys not a bad half
there is another half
we can still do this
we can still do this okay
Sunny you are moving too fast
you have to slow down a bit there are ten others with you
that was a clear opportunity coach
it was not you thought it was
Sunny it is a team game not a one man show
Why do not you tell them why are you asking me slow down
you will do as i say
Come on keep marking
Keep marking move forward
Come on Shaan pass the ball
Come on Shaan
Shaan pass
Release the ball Sunny's shot
Come on Shaan

Come on i was here man
Wrong move Shaan
Sunny was clear
Why did not you pass it to him
now you will teach me what is right and what is wrong
Why did you call Tony if you wanted to play like this
Go to your position
Get out
Ball back come on
Terry is ready to take the corner against Southall
Sunny back
Ashley
you got good team here Paki
Go to that ball
do not ever call me a Paki
this is absolutely shocking
Sunny can play lndia
Come on Ref
i think Ref has been a little lenient Jonny that deserves a Red
what number you were in
8 15
Take it off
Sunny is being replaced
which is good
another foul and he will get a red card and that is exactly what Aston wants
i am supposed to be out there
what the hell are you doing
Southall has to play a really top game to remain in this match
Harry
Hey pass the ball to me
Keep an eye on the keeper
Aston's second goal
i told you i was supposed to be there coach
Hey well done
Shit
lnstead of losing by three we could have won by two goals
oh you would've saved the goals
what could i have done on my own
are you the goalkeeper or am l
what were you defenders doing
you should focus on the ball not the girls
Stupid
Just wear your turban and go home
Dare you talk about the turban with disrespect
i say stop
do not blame him
Talk about yourself
Debu move
Stop it do not fight
what are you doing
Stop it
you will hit me
what is wrong with you guys
you guys are all crazy
Whom are you calling crazy
Trash this scoundrel
he is calling us crazy
Hit him
Why are you hitting me
do not spare him
Hit him
do not spare him
you are calling us crazy

i am telling you
do not you talk nonsense with me
he doesn't pass
Monty
you call yourself footballers
at least one of you is crying
i want you all to get ready and get in the bus in 10 minutes
all of you
you should be ashamed of yourselves
l'm glad about what you did to Patrick
he deserved it
that racist
this is Old Trafford
the Mecca of football
the Manchester United Stadium
on the other side of this tunnel is the Manchester United ground
People call this the theater of dreams
Look at the ground carefully here where real champions play
but their journey to success was not so easy
this clock was stopped on 6 February 1958 at the time when the Manchester United team was returning from a match in Munich and their plane crashed
Eight players lost their lives
they were all under 25
Even their captain lost his life
they are all dead
but it is unfortunate for you that you are alive
you do not have a ground
they did not have a team
the team was finished
but they had a dream
a dream to win
a dream to become champions
they never looked back
they practiced day and night and formed a new team
the fame reputation and trophies are a result of that one dream
there is not a single championship they haven't won
Look carefully all around you
this is the locker room
and only champions come here
These are the faces of champions
Look at their eyes their smiles
but i want to show you something else
what do you see
Whom do you see
Whom do you see there
can you see
do you see a footballer
do you see a champion in there
you call yourself a footballer
See yourself
Look at your eyes
look at your faces
what do you see
the faces of champions
are these the faces of champions
i am fed up and tired of who passed and who did not pass
Bloody red chilli
i do not care anymore
are these the faces of champions
do not you want to be champions
lf you can not play for anyone play for the man in the mirror
we have tied a shroud on our head
we have move out of our houses with an oath
our heads which are raised will never bow down
the country will see and the world will see
we will be tough on everyone
we are obstinate we will never give up
we have the strength
we have the courage
we have a desire to win
the one who messes up with us will be ruined as we all are crazy
Hey dude do not mess with me
Hey dude do not mess with me
Hey dude do not mess with me
Hey dude do not mess with me
Come on grow up guys
Come on move it
yes
Jenny
Jenny
what happened baby
are you okay
what is wrong
you are pregnant
how did this happen
i am sorry stupid question
a boy or a girl
i am sorry another stupid question
you won't do any work until we have the baby you will just lie on the bed
l'il call the doctor
okay
and he will he here all the time
there will be a nurse for 24 hours
and you please do not worry
no moving
Shaan
you are staying in the house no kitchen
Shaan
Relax
Relax
since we have the desire there is a fire within us
we have lit this fire
there is only one target in mind
now it is the time to prove ourselves
it is a fight against them
we will sacrifice our body and soul on the victory
who are we and what are we
we have moved out to prove that
Hey dude do not mess with me
Hey dude do not mess with me
Hey dude do not mess with me
Hey dude do not mess with me
do not mess with me

Your talks are sweet but yet i do not believe them
Your eyes shows me dreams but l know you better

Billo darling if you say l'il sacrifice my life for you
Billo darling if you say l'il sacrifice my life for you

the night before the finals i was at the pub a few English blokes walked in

the Punjabi did not let them touch me not one scratch
he kept saying'Tony you'il play the match tomorrow'
Until he was conscious he was fighting
then fell
then that English man came to me
one of them said that if l'd play the finals the next day they would do to me my wife and child what they had done to the Punjabi
for the first time in my life i experienced real fear

i find it difficult to believe the team is winning the boys are on a high
i am scared now
Why the anxiety
one bad match
and everything would come to an end
Tony you are being very negative

the other teams have seen our game they know our limitations
we do not have options
Southall are on roll
Why do not we go away for the weekend

but this was not discussed earlier
i know i understand but every detail is not discussed
and do not say that here you can not compare this club with Southall United
listen to me Sunny what are you thinking about do not worry about it
l'il take care of things
i think it should be okay
okay good
Well Mr Bhasin all looks good
Welcome to Millwal city
Thank you
Excuse me
i have some wonderful news
what
what
Done
Sunny
Sunny come down
Come down you jerk
Scoundrel
what is this Sunny
lt's mentioned here that from today onwards you won't play for Southall
you did not ask you should've at least told us what you are doing
he is a traitor scoundrel
i am going to kill this guy
it was fine until you were breaking window panes but today you have broken our trust
you have stabbed us in the back
he is a true Englishman
we can never do something like this
Sunny you will never be happy
Monty mortgaged his garage
Stop it shut up
no
Saradarji
Let me speak
l'm telling you to stop
do not say a word
no
those ten thousand pounds in the donation box where do you think it came from
Monty gave it
by mortgaging his garage
she is lying making up stuff
do not say such things
no
Monty really did that
he mortgaged everything
and what did you do
it is enough
he did not ask me before mortgaging the garage
for God sake
i am a professional football player
this is not the first time someone has moved to another club
Behave like men
what is wrong with you
after all it is football
it is not about football
lt's about who we are it is about how we'il be known in this country our parents our children it is about them it is about our identity which you have traded
it is not about football
Football
lt's about our colour
and about the pride in being who we are
lt's about being proud of our heritage
lt's about our name
about our self respect
and you have forced us to bow our heads in shame
Why
Why
and that brings Southall number one on the charts
we are proud of our footballers
Southall has been playing an outstanding tournament
Southall has two more games to go
one with Gatwick atheletic
Harry what if we need to convert a penalty
who is going to shoot
we do not have Sunny
Monty Singh Monty Singh
Right now we are one point ahead of Aston if we win tomorrow we top the league
lf we were to lose then our last match is with Aston
what if it is Aston
so what
what are you trying to say
lt's Aston we are talking about
we have already lost one match against them
lf we lose even one game now then this ground won't be ours
Talk sense
they are the best team
and Sunny is not with us anymore
Look here
it is not about Sunny Bhasin
it is about Southall United Football Club
when we began this season was Sunny with us
we have to win the league
do you understand
Talking nonsense
Debu we will definitely win
against Gatwick as well as Aston
are the gloves comfortable
all the best guys
Focus on the game
Hey you know your markings right
Right game
Monty we have decided that from the cheques we have received we'il pool in the funds and pay off the mortgage on the garage
you moron
we need to get our club a lifeline
yeah
and what are you fellows worried about
l've mortgaged my garage not my honour
that is the spirit
lf Southall United wins today's match they will be this year's combined counties league champions
a must win game for them
and this crucial tag ticks of with Gatwick
Shaan to Mayolene
a good pass and it goes down to Emry
Come on Ranveer
Come on
and that is a good safe
Seems the goalkeeper has hurt his hand
but he is still on the field
and the game resumes
Come on
Please do it
Harry
Block the ball in front of you
Try to shoot it
are you okay
no
he is injured and is calling for a replacement
Aakash comes on to the field
Aakash in place of Ranveer
and after a whole season on the bench for this high pressure match he steps in as the goalkeeper
Abuil passed to Mac
Mac to Eff
Eff to Shawn and Shawn does a goal
Come on do it
and it is a goal
1 0 lead for Gatwick
Aakash is left clueless
his anticipation was wrong
the first goal against Southall
Sit down
Come on sit here
we have to win this one if we want to win the championship
Coach you are saying'if'
Even without the traitor we can win
Forget about him
we won't lose
that is all i wanted to hear
i know you can do it
Pass it
Goal
Shaan has equalized
Come on
Good
Shaan
Come on
Come on
Let's go
Foul
i am taking it down
it is a Southall penalty
and a foul by Gatwick
he got in my way
yes
Come on
Monty
Go for it
Monty is lining up to take the penalty
lf Monty converts this penalty
Southall will be in the lead for the championship title
and the last match with Aston would be a mere formality
but if he doesn't then they must defeat Aston
Southall very close to winning the championship
Come on Monty
and Monty misses the penalty
Shit
Monty misses the penalty
and that is the final whistle
the dreams that we saw
are shattered in pieces now
what shall i do now
what shall i do now
what shall i do now
what shall i do now
oh God
my God
my God
Sunny
hi mom
how have you been
we read about you in the papers
Kavita
lf you have come to tell us how much you are being paid and all that you have got
like the others we have also read about it in the papers
and from this moment on
our relationship is over
i am not talking to you
l've come to take her to my new house
Come on mom
Kavita
Kavita won't go with you
what do you want from me
now why do you object if l'm playing football
what you thought that nobody but the English could do
l've done it dad
and dad
l'm not an lndian
i am a British National
i was born here
i belong here
lf you love lndia so much
why did you ever come here
you should've had me in lndia
Why are you confusing me
Why
what happened
will you tell me
the shop keeper refused to give me the bhelpuri
he said Go to Sunny's house and have English bhelpuri with him
it felt so humiliating
he said you bloody
Your majesty
your princess is here
i beg your pardon Anarkali
it was not his fault
it was my fault
Bye
Bye
i could not understand that
i had to return this
i could've sent it
but you would not know why l'm doing so
i can not keep this
or anything that is related to you
you could not honour the sentiments related to football then how can i expect you to honour my sentiments
you betrayed your own people
how can i trust you to stand by me
Why am i even complaining
lt's not like you have changed
you were always like this and still are
Come on Asif
Rumana
everyone is angry with you
they do not understand
lf your brother gets a chance to play with Rooney what would you tell him
you are Rooney to me
Look after yourself
do not you worry about me l'il be fine
you just concentrate on match
we have to win
for the first time ever
something is more important than football
Football
League
Ground
Cup
None of these is above you
Shaan
nothing
i love you both
what is your pick for the final Johnny
Aston without a doubt
they are playing well they are quick and they have the best coach
however we can not ignore one fact and that is Sunny Bhasin who is not playing with Southall United today
hi may i have a fresh lime soda please
one beer please
Sunny
Sunny Bhasin
lt's our Sunny
Son of great Jaidev Bhasin
Sunny
Today l've finally met you
Jaidev's son is such a huge football star
Your dad is probably ecstatic with joy
he was always passionate about football must've become fanatical now
you know my dad
do i know
what sort of a question is that
we were very close friends
for 13 14 years we drank together
we were very thick friends
Neither did he ever miss a Southall match nor did l
he was Southall United's most ardent fan what can i say about your dad
he was such a huge star
he was such a huge star
and ever since that unfortunate night
Your dad never came back
which night
1985
it was the night before the 1985 final
Southall had made it to the finals but the English could not bear it they attacked Tony Singh
he was your dad's idol
he stood between them and Tony he fought with them till he could
he fought for Southall United
he was a passionate fan
an avid supporter of Southall United
Today they broke your nose
Tomorrow it will be your legs
what you are running after today
you will run away from it tomorrow
he longed for just one thing
that Southall United would one day be the champion
he would often say
my son will fulfill my dream
you might remember that when
i first came to Southall United to meet you
l'd thought what would i do with you
how could i possibly help you
the truth is
i did not really help you
ln fact you have helped me
the football player who was hiding for 25 years so that no one would know his name
Today when i am asked
who me
who am l
i am Tony Singh
Coach of the Southall United Football Club
a person gets just two or four chances during his life where he can make a difference
during the 90 minutes on the field you will possess the ball only for two to four minutes
and it doesn't matter if you are Zidane Maradona Pele or Beckham
lt's their game in those four minutes that matters
so it is what you do with the football during those four minutes
that is crucial
we started this fight to save our club and ground
but today when the fight ends it should seem as though we have fought for our country
we have fought for Pakistan Bangladesh and lndia
Today we'il play so well
that every spectator will be proud of us
Today even the football will be proud of us
Even the losing team will be proud of our win today
Just remember one thing
Go out there and win
hello ladies and gentlemen
Johnny Bakshi live from the Aston football ground
it seems today that those who are not present at the stadium are probably not Asian
and the moment that every lndian Pakistani and South Asian football fan was waiting for has finally arrived
Good luck Tony
Attack

for the rest of you in the Trial Division or on the Executive Staff if a cop or a detective needs a search warrant at 3 a M you are to type it up go to the judge's house pull him off his wife or whoever else he is on top of and get it signed
if anybody calls for a definition of probable cause reasonable suspicion
stop and search you look it up and fax it to him in three minutes or your ass is mine

Resign
Morgy i am Senior Trial Counsel
Turning this over to anybody but me is an insult that is incredibly damaging to me to my career
Turning it over to an ADA with eight months experience's more than insulting
it is shocking humiliating unacceptable

those little planted stories in the papers
Morgenstern is old
Morgenstern's has got heart problems
Morgenstern's lost his touch

Sean
Nail the son of a bitch
i will Pop
i love you
Good morning ladies and gentlemen
Morning Sam
i have an announcement to make
i have agreed to defend Jordan Washington
so you know where he is
yes yes i know where he is
i want to arrange for a quiet surrender to the District Attorney's office
how and when did you contact each other
through an intermediary Don
Talking about defense
what possible defense do you plan to offer in this case
you working for the DA's office Bill
Your paper certainly does
you are usually so willing to talk Sam
Why are you being so coy
no no you are all going to have to just wait for the trial
and let me assure you that we want a trial
in fact
Emily would you send Mr Washington in please
you have had him here the whole time
how long
does the DA know that he is here
Jordan now's your chance to make a statement
what is the plea going to be
my client will not answer any questions
would you take off your shirt and lower your trousers please
Notice ladies and gentlemen that he is completely unmarked
Turn around please
there are no bruises no breaks of skin
I'd like you to notice the kidney area which is a favorite police target and also the buttocks and the genitals
Thank you very much
we are delivering Jordan in perfect condition
we have a car waiting downstairs
we are going downtown now to deliver Mr Washington to District Attorney Morgenstern
We'd like you all to come along as witnesses so we can all be sure that Mr Washington shows up for his first day of trial in exactly the same condition as you see him here today
he is bringing Washington down here to surrender
that fucking Vigoda just wants to rub our noses in it
we could not capture him
he surrendered voluntarily
Well fuck Vigoda
Lawrence you get your men down there and when that car turns into Worth Street you stop it you drag the black son of a bitch onto the street and cuff him
i want four officers one on each arm one on each leg to drag that man into the building and throw him in a fucking cell
that is what i promised the people of this city and that is what they are going to get
i am not going to let that little commie shyster humiliate this office
and if he gets in the way arrest him
for obstruction of justice
here they come
Wave them through guys
Wave them through
Lieutenant i am surrendering my client
you are obstructing justice there is no need for that
you are obstructing justice
you
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Damn it
Get the cameras over to the car
this is completely unnecessary and excessive use of force
Channel 11's legal expert Joshua Field
Well District Attorney Morgenstern has had a disaster
what was supposed to be a quiet surrender of Jordan Washington turned into a three ring circus
there could be grounds for a change of venue appeal at minimum
what the hell do you want
you have buried yourself
i have come to gloat
you know as well as i Vigoda's a great attorney
if he is defending Washington you have got something to worry about
that is beside the fact you will have every black militant and left wing group in the city blocking every bridge disrupting every highway and screaming police brutality under your window every night when you are trying to get some sleep
and he will eat your hero cop lawyer alive
Fuck you
i am withdrawing my resignation
Thanks for taking your time accepting it
you my Hebraic friend are in trouble on this case and
i can not wait to see you take the fall
Good night
Just ran riot
this is Liam Casey
Please leave a message
Hey Pop i hope this means you are sleeping not out dancing somewhere
Tomorrow's the big day
Wish me luck
Hey Morgy this is Sean
i just call to say how much i appreciate everything you have done for me and that i won't let you down
Mr Casey your opening statement
Your honor ladies and gentlemen of the jury i am going to be very brief
this city just recently buried three police officers
a fourth is recovering from three bullet wounds
one of the dead officers was shot by another unidentified officer because of the confusion created by the defendant's actions
the other two dead officers and the wounded police officer had bullets in their bodies that came from the defendant's gun
it is that simple
the case against the defendant is defined by three gravestones and a set of crutches
i have no doubt of our proof and i have no doubt of your eventual verdict
Well thank you
Mr Vigoda
Your honor
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury Mr Casey has stated the facts and we do not dispute one word of what he said
however you have to be crazy to shoot three cops and Jordan Washington is not crazy
what Mr Casey has left out is that my client was fighting for his life
what my client has left out is that my client was going to be executed
what Mr Casey has left out is that cops from three precincts the six four six five and seven four were in business with my client and had been for years
and as in so many businesses there was a falling out among partners
Somebody was offering a better price for the protection services that these precincts were providing
when my client refused to go along with that new price it was decided that he had to go
Why do you think three precincts responded to that call
J Washington knew what was happening when he heard footsteps in the hall
and he was not going to sit idly by and wait for his executioners to destroy him
now it is true
Jordan Washington fired through that door
and it is true that bullets from my client's gun took the lives of two more New York City cops
but their dying began well before that tragic night
their deaths began on the day that corrupt cops agreed to protect dope dealing in Harlem
now i grieve for those dead policemen
as far as i know they were not part of any conspiracy
but i cannot let a man go to jail for the rest of his life for doing what is acknowledged as a man's most basic right the right of self defense
Thank you
Vigoda's witness list includes 17 cops from the six four the six five and the seven four
what do you mean do not worry
because it is bullshit it is a theory
Theories are crap
he wants to confuse and divert the jury
do not let him divert you
Three dead cops one seriously wounded
that is your case
Cops on the take Morgy
no kidding
Thanks for the information
Washington had to be paying somebody
will you stop worrying about it
that is another question
Take one
that is another trial
this one is about
Three dead cops one seriously wounded
i know
oh Eileen i told you not spicy
Damn
so you were completely occupied with Detective Casey and you really knew nothing about what was going on in the streets
yes sir that is correct
Thank you detective
Your witness
Detective Allegretto have you ever heard of the name Kleinhoff
who
Kleinhoff
no not that i can recall
Thank you
that is all
the witness is excused
Detective Liam Casey
do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
i do
Good morning Detective Casey
Morning Counselor

Nine years

Thirty six years

Jordan Washington

Naturally i can not tell you his name
we understand
one day six seven months ago we learned that the defendant if we got lucky we'd see him coming in or out
so you cased that house for two and a half weeks all day and all night
Damn near
oh i mean a couple of times we'd miss some hours
Once we both got sick from some bad hero sandwiches
Things like that
did not you ask for help from precinct in narcotics you got to be careful
on a good lead you do not want too much ord out
what did you then do
we got lucky
Sunday night the snitch showed
that is Sunday 13 October
yes sir
so now we are in business
so then you had absolutely no knowledge of what was going on outside
the next thing i saw was you standing by my bed in ICU at Metropolitan
Thank you Detective
Your witness Counselor
Good afternoon Detective Casey
you on sick leave now
yes sir
what is the prognosis
Pretty good six to eight months i will be as good as new
i am glad to hear it
i only have two or three areas that I'd like to cover
you had a warrant
yes
now something that you said has made me curious
this thing about not getting any help during what must have been an arduous even tortuous surveillance
you testified
on a good lead you do not want too much word out
what did you mean by that
Narcotics are complicated
the fewer people know about what you are doing the better it is
does that apply to your fellow officers
Objection you honor
the charge here is murder not police corruption
the defense may tie the two together your honor
a line of questioning you opened up cancelled overruled
you may answer Detective Casey
you have to be careful
i do not understand
you mean narcotics information is a two way street
that police officers can be informed about dealers and dealers can be informed about police officers
i am not sure i get the question
Well then regretfully i must be blunt
were you afraid that if you involved any other officers one of them might get word to Jordan Washington
Like i said you got to be careful
i am sorry to press you Detective but i must ask you to answer either yes or no
yes
since you did not share this information with men of your own precinct you did not share it with officers in any other precinct
Am i correct
yes or no
i shared it with nobody
Except your partner
Except my partner
i just have one more question
you ever heard of the name Kleinhoff
not that i know of
he is an ex police officer
in fact the records indicate that both of you served in the same precinct for a period of some two weeks
it was a long time ago about twenty years
Kleinhoff does that name sound familiar
no counselor
Like you said a long time ago
i understand
Thank you that is all
7 4 7
Allegretto
we got a fix on Jordan Washington
1 1 1
shall i play it for you again Lieutenant
we hear Detective Allegretto very clearly calling into the 74th precinct
Why did men from the 64th precinct respond
they thought more help might be needed
more help
but just a few seconds had elapsed before your men responded
Why
how did your men know that more help was needed
Did i hear you correctly Sergeant
Men of the six five responded because an officer down call had come in
yes sir
but the officer down call did not go out until almost two minutes after the original call came in and men from the six five were already on their way
how do you explain that
you drove and i quote
like a bat out of hell
Why
it was a big collar
we wanted in on it
Finally someone gives me a straight answer
you were how old at this point
Six or seven
and this was your fifth foster home
i do not know i lost count
what about brothers and sisters Mr Washington
Five of us we got split up early
no foster home wanted five kids
you were the youngest
that is right
where was your mother during this time
all over
Mama was all over
she was a user an addict
what happened to her
i do not know
Father
i never knew him
how old were you Mr Washington when you hit the streets permanently
Maybe ten
how did you live
i became a runner
a drug runner
that is right
could you give us a description of how you lived over the next few years
i kind moved up i learned where the money goes
then i got busted and did two and a half in Elmira
and when you got out
Carved out a piece of turf for myself
Took it one block at a time
Nobody's stopping me
so now you were a full time dealer
that is right
in your experience Mr Washington
what is the most important thing a full time dealer needs
Three different things a place to buy it a place to sell it and protection
Protection from other dealers
no see i takes care of that myself
Protection from what
all of this shit
how do you protect yourself from this
Well how do you do anything
Money
who is Kurt Kleinhoff
Ex cop
my bag man
Meaning the one who pays everyone off
that is right
can you tell us how that works
first of the month
Kleinhoff go out with a little black satchel look like a doctor bag stops by the bar the precinct and the pizza parlor and pays off cops
so much for the patrolman so much for the sergeant
lieutenant captain
how much
Six hundred grand a year
how much
Six hundred grand a year fifty grand a month three precincts to pay off
and those precincts were
Six four Six five Seven four
could you give us the names of the officers involved
Objection your honor
the defendant was not present at the alleged pay off
we must not take his word on this he must not name names
Sustained
who is Carlos Alvarez
Guy trying to take over my operation
how did he try
See he moved the ante up
he offered the cops six hundred and fifty grand a year
so my police friends tried to shake me down for another fifty
i said no get the fuck out of here
Once that shit starts i am finished
so i said no and i figured I'd take care of Alvarez my own way
and did you
no see i never got the chance
Alvarez figured I'd be coming on after him so he tell the cops and they do not want to give up that fifty so they come on after me
and that was the night of October 13th
yeah
but i knew what was happening maybe a month before that
Kleinhoff say
first time they find you they coming on after you
we are perfectly aware that you grew up amid conditions that were heartbreaking
Let me ask you something
Remember the first time you hit somebody
no
it seems like i am always hitting or being hit
oh yes because you say in your testimony here and i quote
i have carved out a piece of turf for myself i took it end quote
that must have taken a lot of hitting did not it
Did it
when you were expanding your drug empire and i quote one block at a time did you ever kill anybody
Your honor i am instructing my client not to answer that question on the grounds of self incrimination
are you pleading the Fifth Amendment Mr Washington
yes
Did you ever order anyone killed
Same instructions your honor
Fifth Amendment
when you were in jail for assault with deadly weapon did you kill anybody
Fifth Amendment
when your turf was firmly established when you were now numero uno top dog kingpin M M did you order anyone
Fifth fucking Amendment
Enough of this
we will ask questions and wait for responses in a civilized way
Your honor the prosecutor is bating
Sit down Mr Vigoda
i will run this courtroom with no help from you nor anyone
Continue Mr Casey
Thanks your honor
Let's go to the night of the shootout
Sunday October 13th
Did you hear Detectives Casey and Allegretto coming up the stairs
when you fired fifteen shots straight at the door did you see Detective Casey go down
the door was there
but by the end of your fusillade the door was in pieces
Did you see Detective Casey get hit
no
Did you see any blood
no
when you got down to the basement did you see two policemen
oh yeah
Did you see their faces before firing
yeah
were they young or old
i do not know
you just said you saw their faces
not clear
which is it yes or no
i do not know
when you fired your 357 Magnum did you see where the bullets hit
where did they hit
one in the head and one in the body
was there blood
oh yeah
Lots of it
yeah
Let me ask you something
Did any get on your tiny white sneakers
Motherfucker
Remove the defendant
Remove the defendant
Get him out of here
Jury's on the way

Good sign but who knows
Guilty on all five charges

Well did i smell it huh
you all thought i was nuts but i knew this kid had it had it all
Sean come on up here
Sean Casey

Welcome come on welcome

Sit

Fine
i do not know if you can make it erect
i think i can
Classy car
i am lucky my parents have money
where are we going
Home
i live in Queens
i do not
you are a miracle
i know
but only to people that i want to like me
how do you decide
Instinct
i could not believe what i was seeing when you cross examined Washington
i knew i was watching the start of a great career
i knew that at the least i wanted to get you into bed
how come you do not wait to be asked
i hate that coy bullshit
i live my life as openly and as honestly as possible
you are completely attractive
i know
so now you get 3 00 a M scrambled eggs i get ice cream and
i hope i am impressing you enough so that we can see each other again
i am very impressed we will see each other again
and still tonight was not casual for me
Well it started casual for me
i was a little loaded
there is a beautiful and sexy woman well what is there to lose
Right now it feels like the beginning of something
can you spend the night
Impelliteri is setting the sentencing date tomorrow
i should show up in my other suit
See
the first heartbreak already
i will make up for it
how
i do not know
Good eggs
what did you find
Forget about it
nothing left of that joker but a skeleton
God only knows how long he is been down there
Poor kids were crabbing
one of their lines got snagged
how do you like that
on the first charge
would you stand Mr Washington
on the first charge the death of Patrolman Finney the sentence is twenty five years to life with no parole
on the second charge the death of Patrolman Katz twenty five years to life no parole
on the third charge the wounding of Detective Casey twenty five years to life no parole
on the fourth and fifth charges fifteen to twenty five years each with no parole
Sentences to run consecutively
Goodbye Mr Washington
you know that floater you fished out last week
we finally got an ID on him
NYPD medical name of Kleinhoff
and that man is Pat Distefano
and if we stick together we can win it all
we can win it all
we got it
Hell of an acceptance speech
oh fuck
Morgy Morgy
Turn him over
Turn him over
Let's stop fucking around
now i am sure you have each got somebody whose name you'd like to put up
and we are only two hours away from the six o'clock news
now i have got an idea
Morgy's in ICU
I'd like to ask you for prayers for him tonight
but we are a party rich in talent
i would like to place in nomination and i would be proud if you accept it by acclamation
for the office of District Attorney i nominate
Sean CASEY
i wish she could've seen it
i wish she could've heard it
i sure hope she knows
she knows
yeah i think you are right
she is got to be as proud as i am
Well i hope she was not disappointed
in what
she always had hopes of me joining the church
i know she wanted me to
Tempted
i was
we were blessed Pop
that is the word
we were blessed
you got to try it on
yeah
Looking good on you
Sean Vigoda on two
hello
i know you are busy but it is important that we meet
okay what is good for you
Well i will meet you anytime you want but Sean someplace where neither of us can wear a wire
you heard that the body they fished out of the river turned out to be Kleinhoff
if you win i want you to pursue that murder
as soon as you can use the Investigation Division of the DA's office
Going through any precincts is not the best way to find what you look for
Sooner or later you are going to run into dirty cops
you are not telling me you believed your defense
you heard the tapes you heard the testimony
Total chaos on the street that night
all right Jordan Washington is scum
sometimes i just get so sick inside
so so discouraged you know
i feel like we have to just give up on an entire generation
Lock them up and throw away the key
Am i hearing this from the last of the 60's radicals
are you conning me
yes to the first and not to the second
Why'd you take the case
because i was after something else
what
Sean the first rule of the drug world
there can not be that much money around without dirty cops
that is what i wanted to get to
Why
who appointed you
my 15 year old daughter when she O D ed
you know when your kid dies before you it is not the natural order of things
Your whole life changes
when i was a cop with the 103 in Queens four cops got caught on the pad
it was nothing big the usual C note a month
but i remember i was ducking into the station house because i did not want to get cornered by the reporters
i did not want to get caught on camera because i was ashamed
in the meantime those four cops were being brought in by their buddies
they had their coats over their hands so their cuffs would not show they had their heads ducked down low so nobody would recognize them
i remember feeling i wanted to pull their heads up by their hair so everybody could see
because a cop like that is the scum of the earth
you get me real evidence i will follow it wherever it leads
Wherever
yeah wherever
you are a romantic
and i think you are blushing
it is the heat
it is not the heat
you are blushing
i think i am going to vote for you
Your final statement Mr Harrison
you have two minutes
though constantly taking the high moral ground
Mr Casey's naivet' keeps trapping him in the depths of well to put it mildly questionable behavior
he is in the midst of an affair with someone
no no no
Please please listen
i do not bring this up as a smear
it is just that the person he is involved with works for a law firm that has been a consistent enemy of law and order in this city
in two instances traffic was stopped for hours once at the Brooklyn Bridge and once at the Queens Midtown Tunnel
they have represented the pushcart peddlers who drive away business from legitimate tax paying merchants
Welfare cheats corrupt local school boards in other words all the elements that have made life in this city almost unlivable
the District Attorney's office is the representative of law and order in this city
who do you want sitting in that chair
a newly graduated naive lawyer with one easy victory behind him
a man who sees nothing wrong with an involvement in a law firm that has at times brought this city to its knees
or the calm reasoned objective point of view of someone who is devoted 18 years of public service to this city and its people
Thank you
Mr Casey
i am not even going to respond to the personal attack other than to say that we are sort of living in sin because she won't marry me
i have asked
i would like to address what i think Mr Harrison here is really talking about
we are all perfectly aware of the complete loss of respect that exists for government today particularly the law
Well i believe that the system can work
but you all of you need one basic reassurance you need to know that the law applies to everyone equally
Rich poor black white yellow brown witness jury perpetrator victim cops judges Wall Street welfare
all everyone equally
the party ticket i am running on may not like what i am saying but i am telling you how i feel
there will be only one standard
Did that person break the law
if i am elected the law will exclude no one
all everyone will be equal before the law
Just like it says on the building
Thank you
do we have to go back
you do
Big campaign stops tomorrow
Right
this place is magic
for what it is worth i never thought I'd want a place like this
Until this morning while making coffee for you
it is worth a lot you make very good coffee
i think we should get married
will you marry me
Let's not push it marriage was not great for me
you weren't married to me
how was your meeting with Vigoda
it was interesting
i can not tell you the content of it
i understand
when you are the D a we may wind up on opposite sides a lot
we will have lots of secrets from each other
i hate that
so what do you suggest
i suggest we tell each other everything
we will leave it up to the other person to decide whether to use it
God you like to make things difficult
Why not just keep quiet
that is also an option
Come in
Thanks for coming in Mr Casey
of
of course we have seen each other around for months but never really met
i am Captain Lawrence Head of Investigation for the D A' s office
of course
this is my assistant Lieutenant Gentile
how are you Counselor
hi how are you
you did a hell of a job
i will be working for you after November
this is Lieutenant Wilson Internal Affairs
Wilson will you take over
Harbor Police fished out what was practically a skeleton in the East River some months ago
Dental records identified the body as Kurt Kleinhoff
a few days later we obtained a copy of a small black address book
i can not tell you how
the address book had the names of fifteen police officers
the fifteen officers were and are presently in the Six four the Six five and the Seven four
as of yesterday at four o'clock we have officially taken over the investigation
that is what we are here for that is what our department does
one of our first investigations is to find out how many officers named in that book were present at the Jordan Washington shoot out
do you know if Kleinhoff was dirty
we do not know
Yet
but we sort of kept tabs on him after he left the force
he was always around drugs on the fringes
where there was dope and dealers there was Kleinhoff
we were getting close when he floated up
no point looking for the killer forensics can not give us a hint of how he died
so why am i here
one of the names in the book was Joey Allegretto
Your father's partner
we have to bring him in Sean but we do not want to hurt you or your campaign
and God knows we do not want to hurt your father
we thought it might be worthwhile for you to talk to him first
Maybe it is something maybe it is nothing
but if it is something maybe he will talk to you
then maybe we can see if there is a way of exercising some damage control on this whole mess
and i am supposed to report back to you is that it
if i were you I'd do it Mr Casey
it is better to know than not know
Anybody else you want me to talk to
not at the moment
what the fuck they do not give you an office
we got to meet out here
Come here
how you doing
what is the matter
what is the matter with you
I'd never wear a wire on you Joe
i am sorry
i know that i am sorry
Come on come here i am sorry
it is just that ever since Kleinhoff floated up everybody's a little tense that is all
Why are they tense Joey
oh people are talking
what are they talking about
Internal Affairs getting involved
Your office
People are edgy
Joey you said at the trial you did not know Kleinhoff
yeah well i lied
Why
' Cause committing perjury's a hell easier than admitting you know Kleinhoff
Well what are you going to do
you going to report me
i will report as little or as much of this conversation as i want to
that is the deal
you do not know Internal Affairs
you think that is the deal
i am the next D a of this city that is the deal
okay
i am asking Joe you a dirty cop
never
Why is your name in Kleinhoff's book
did not know he had a book
anyway he tried to call me a couple of times
i always said no
Why did not you go after him
the truth
yeah
i did not have the balls
he meant a lot of money to many cops
i figured I'd keep my own nose clean and that is that
Did he try to reach my father
Look at me
Did he try to reach my father
i swear to you
as far as i know your father's clean
okay
Why here
you swear to me on Mama's grave you are clean on this Kleinhoff business
Kleinhoff
Kleinhoff
you know damn well who Kleinhoff is
do not look at me that way
he had his hands all over some cops in the Six four Six five and Seven four
Swear to me right here Pop right here you are clean
i swear to you at your mother's grave
i am clean
Why did you lie at the trial
Joey's already told you
Joey told you about our meeting
of course
what about Joe
he is clean
why is his name in Kleinhoff's book
Kleinhoff tried to reach him
Joey comes to me and asks me what should he do
i told him i did not want to touch it so he turned him down
how do you know
how do i know what
that he turned him down
he is my partner
i am sorry
i am sorry Pop
he is clean Captain Lawrence
Thank you Sean
Glad to hear it
Sean's talked to him says Allegretto's clean
that is what I'd expect him to say
it is nine o'clock results
Let's go
Let's go to our correspondent Colleen H with our special election coverage
with voting just ended we have already got our first victory of the evening
and considering how close the polls were it comes as a big surprise
According to our exit polling Sean Casey will win easily over his
Congratulations Sean
sixty four percent of the vote by our projections
though not quite that conclusively it looks by early count that
Mayor Williams should also waltz in comfortably
it can not go on like this
can it
one wonderful thing happening after another
in my experience no
it can not go on like this
what is been your experience
oh nothing brutal
in fact on the whole i am lucky
it is just that i keep picking guys that i expect to be perfect
i do not mean money and looks
like you
Just perfect
and then we get close and the flaws show up
i guess that is my flaw expecting Lancelot
you haven't picked wrong with me Peggy
i know and it frightens me even more
what if you are everything i hoped for and
what
and what
and it turns out i am not good enough for you
if i am not i do not want to know that about myself
will you marry me
Maybe
i want to
but i am scared
can we at least live together
in the same place
okay your place or mine
Whichever
mine
Good choice
but do not give up yours
Yet
no i do not recognize the name Kleinhoff
i have had over 1000 officers working under me in my command for 32 years
how do you expect me to remember a name
'Cause he was paying you every month
if you are clean you got no reason to be so nervous
are you kidding me
you know what it means to even be called in here
you got pictures
what have you got
we do not have to tell you anything you have to tell us
Bullshit if you had pictures you'd be shoving them into my face so you could turn me into a rat
i do not know nothing about knocking off Washington
i will not answer any questions unless a PBA lawyer is present
I'd like you to repeat that
Just one time outside this room
You'd be swallowing your teeth by now
i swear i am innocent
Kill Jordan Washington
are you crazy
not a crack
Mr Casey
it always starts this way
Everybody's innocent
they are all lying
if their lips are moving they are lying
within a week somebody'll come in to make a deal for himself then the whole house of cards collapses
they are going down
Come heavy
Barnard Street apartment 3 David
we got two plain clothes going in with warrant
Send back up
Come heavy
hi
Sean
yeah
one of your perks
Well if there is anyone you want as your secretary
i mean you should have who you want
Eileen I'd like you to stay on please
i need all the help i can get
I'd be honored
Eileen you know where the warrant might be
the one that Joey and my father had
it is in that stack i just brought you
all the documentation is chronological so it should be right at the top
that is a Xerox you know where the original might be
who signed this
Impelleteri
could have gone back to his office or floating around the 74th precinct
do you want me to locate it
Please
could take a couple of days
okay
hi
hi
how you feeling Morgy
Lousy
what else do you want to ask me
i came to thank you
i owe a lot to you
do not thank me
i might not have done you a favor
it will start soon you will see
what will start
the pressure
in fact from what i heard it is started already
what did you hear
Internal Affairs they are pressing you
how did you hear it
People owe me
how bad is it
i do not know yet
this Internal Affairs business
i am afraid to go through the door
i do not know what to expect
Expect the worst so prepare yourself
Everybody's going to want a piece of you now that you are elected
Leaves you in a damn good position kid
when they grab for you when they go for that piece of you you get something back
you always get back more than you gave
you hear me kid
more than you gave
what are you saying to me
it is going to be one big deal i am making
no a hundred little ones
a thousand
Deal after deal after deal after deal
it is not why i became a lawyer
who cares why you became a lawyer
Only you nobody else gives a shit
Why
you want clean hands
Become a priest
Look kid what you are searching for you are not going to find it
not in this place not at this time
Maybe no place at any time
but you will be better than most
that is what you are going to have to be satisfied with
Get the hell out of here please
you are depressing me
Come on
oh God
Please
I'd kiss you but you are an ugly bastard
so what do you think Lieutenant
can i do myself some good here
you are the first to come forward i am sure we can help
but i will need corroboration for everything you tell us
i do not see a problem
my old partner Estevez
you had him in here
for a deal he will talk
Good
but that is it
after the two of you no more deals
i am saddened to announce the indictment this morning of five police officers on on charges of bribery and dealing in narcotics
their names are in the press release you have been given
the indictments are the result of a two month investigation by the Internal Affairs Division
the investigation was conducted by Lieutenant Wilson
any more cops to come Sean
it is an ongoing investigation
you are an ex cop Mr District Attorney
how do you feel
Lousy
i notice that three of the five names were in the 74th precinct
is not your father in the 74th precinct
if there is anything i hate as much as a dirty cop it is a scandal mongering reporter looking for a sensationalist story
Your smear of a good cop a cop who almost gave his life for this city is despicable
you find that funny
Having said that i can tell you that this investigation will go wherever the evidence leads
this press conference is over
Eileen any word on the warrant
oh i forgot to tell you
we can not find any trace of the original
how come
Happens all the time
i will clear this
here let me help you
i got it thanks
Just sit there
Like you to volunteer after all the hard work's done right
Making the roast beef that is when i could've used you
Peeling potatoes scraping the carrots
Sit there and drink your Guinea Red
i will take care of it
it was great Pop
when did you learn how to cook
oh after your mom died
Days off got so damn lonely around here
but people were nice
they kept on inviting me for Sunday dinner
i knew I'd have to invite them back and restaurants round here ain't great
Also i tend to drink a little too much in a restaurant i do not know why
so i started cooking
Made my days off go faster
and i could repay my neighbors like a civilized man
Go ahead do not wait for me
i will just get some milk
i can not take credit for that pie i am afraid
it is store bought but Casey heated
there we go
Want some coffee
yeah
so Sean you wanted to see us and we wanted to see you
so what is up
Go ahead take it
you first
okay we got a little favor to ask you Seano
Tough one Pop
for you i guess it will be
Go ahead
i guess the only thing to do is say it
Right
got caught with my hand in the cookie jar
whose cookie jar
oh Kleinhoff
Somebody ratted me out to Internal Affairs and they called me in
how long you been on the take
about four years
how much
over the whole time i do not know about sixty or seventy grand
Grand jury
yeah in about two or three weeks
what do you want me to do about it
Joey's offered to co operate
i told them you know they got me
that fucking prick Wilson turned me down
he says he is got everybody he needs
Talk to him Sean
he could use Joey
one more witness never hurt the prosecution
he will listen to you
you are the D a
it is a personal thing with that fucking prick he is been after me for years
about eight nine years ago
Bullshit bullshit
you might as well be selling dope yourself
Sean do not
what do you mean do not
do not what Pop
do not tell him he is a scumbag
that he is a disgrace
what about it Pop
you tell me what do you want me to do
Sean he is my partner
Right hold it
Just hold it
i do not want you two to
i mean that is just not right
yeah i am your partner but this is your son
and i do not want to cause no bad feeling between you two
and you you can stop worrying'cause he had nothing to do with anything
there is no way i am going to talk to Internal Affairs about him
what if i had something new to offer
something new to offer
Like what
there were eight cops who
Eight cops who what Joey
what
Talked about taking out Washington
my God
Including you Joey
yeah including me
that night of the shoot out they all came
and they were there the night of the shoot out weren't they
Including the two rat fucks that turned me into Wilson
the two rat fucks
Rat fucks
you took money from Harlem's biggest dealer you committed perjury at his trial you engaged in a conspiracy to kill him when he would not cough up more dough and now you are offering to turn in seven other cops in order to save yourself and you have the nerve to call them rat fucks
you were a cop Joe and now you are garbage you are nothing
i hope some crazy junky takes you out in an alley one night
Sean i did not know
Vigoda was right
it is funny you spend years with a partner you live sometimes you die together
but you do not know him
was Jordan Washington the only honest witness at the trial
you mean did i lie about anything
Course not Pop
Did you
the warrant
that is what i came to see you about
what about it
the day of the stake out i made out a new one
the old one expired the day before
i made out a new one signed Impelliteri's name
Nobody checks a signature
Why
Pop why
Well
Nail it son
Remember
we were this close this close to nailing that son of a bitch
Snitch said he was going to show that weekend
Get an extension
it was a Friday
Go find a judge at 3 o'clock on a Friday no you could have found one Pop
how many judges do you think i know
huh
and i do not trust half of them
i wanted Jordan Washington
you do not know how bad i wanted him
Biggest fucking collar of my whole life
and that bastard murderer
a man who destroys his own people
they did it to him
now he was doing it to others
and there were fifteen cops helping him
do not give me that shit
Six hundred thousand dollars a year
Six hundred thousand dollars a year
how many can resist that
how many doctors lawyers the bastards who put the gas tanks in the wrong place
those fucks that buy boats with other people's life savings
Tell me who can resist six hundred thousand dollars
i will tell you who twenty seven thousand other cops on the force that is who
or maybe it is twenty six thousand or twenty five thousand
or maybe it is twenty thousand
but it is more than the rest of the goddam country
and to top it all off two of us go in me and Joey
two of us go through that door because we want Jordan Washington
Only Jesus Christ stopped me from killing him on the spot
and you think i am going to let him walk when all i got to do is go down the hall
Make a copy smudge it up a little
Leave it on my desk
i will be sure I'd rather do time than not do what i did
it can happen Pop
you can do time and Jordan'll walk if word gets out
i need some wine
i still got it
the warrant
the original
the outdated one
i got kind of superstitious
i wanted the jacket around me to remind me how close I'd come to dying
how lucky i have been after you know how many years
Thirty seven
Thirty seven
when i left the hospital they gave me my clothes back
the jacket and shoes are all that is left
the shirt the pants they had to cut them away
i reached in the pocket and there it was
Jesus Christ what a mess i have brought to you
i think i am going to head home now Pop
Listen Sean
if you can not live with this
you know just keeping a secret about the warrant just tell me
i do not want you to carry the burden
i will go in and tell them i did it
i do not want you to go against your feelings because you know what is right
i am just an old cop who maybe should have been put out to pasture long ago
there is so much going on i just do not understand anymore
Joey's dead
he shot himself
how did you hear
Morning news driving down here
Did he leave a note
a note did he leave a note
they did not say
Frank

Sean are you all right
yeah
Detective Casey nice to see you
i am real sorry i had to call you at home your honor
Thanks for seeing me
no big deal
Come on in
Thank you
Come in
is this what i think it is
what do you think it is
during the trial there was a Xerox of the arrest warrant
as soon as i saw this i knew this was the original and that there is probably a difference between the two
is there
yeah
the date was changed and the signature
you going to take it to Vigoda
i have to
i can not
Hear
i work for him and i am in love with you
i am the D a and i am not to destroy evidence
it is happened before
it was not supposed to happen to me
it is not supposed to happen to any of us
that is the story your honor
so i came to turn myself in
Wow
hello
Mr Casey
yes
Impelliteri here
Your dad's sitting here with me
he is just told me some cock and bull story about an arrest warrant
it seems to me he is confused
i distinctly remember filling out the warrant for him on the raid day
what was that date again Liam
October 13th
Right October 13th
i can remember it as clearly as if i were doing it now
i was so excited at the idea that we might bring in Jordan Washington
i could not wait to fill it out
i wished him good luck i remember that
he told me there is another warrant floating round
do you have it
yes your honor
Get rid of it
i have got the original right here
it must have been sent to the house instead of the office
i will bring it in with me today
Thanks your honor
Your honor may i speak to my father please
Your son wants you
Hey Seano
Pop
Pop
Did you hear about Joey
no
what
it is bad news Pop
so i am quitting
Why quit
because i can see where it is going
i owe Impelliteri
i do not know who my father owes
i owe Peggy
Peggy owes you for not bringing you the warrant
it will go on forever
oh goddamn it
Sean things never work out as simply as you want them to
if Peggy had brought me that warrant i do not know that i would have used it
i mean it i was after dirty cops i got dirty cops
Why should i let that animal back out on the street
what about his rights
oh i am not perfect
i never thought i was perfect
do you think you are perfect
not any more
my name is McGovern
Mr McGovern to you
i am the Assistant to the Assistant Deputy Administrative Assistant to the District Attorney of New York County
we are starting something new this year
the District Attorney will be giving the opening orientation lecture
Ladies and gentlemen District Attorney Casey
Eight months ago i was ready to resign
it was all so much more complicated than i imagined
it started when i was an ADA just as you hope to be soon
my first time out first time in Night Court
i had eighteen cases to handle
and as you will soon find out you have to arraign your perps within twenty four hours of their arrest
one half hour before court
i finally got all my yellow sheets down from Albany and the first guy up i have never seen him before but his yellow sheet shows he is got one prior conviction for robbery
but i do not know if he mugged an old lady in an alley to feed his habit or he stole food from a supermarket to feed his kids
and later i got involved in a case where breaking the law was more just than upholding the law
and upholding the law killed a man
i do not have to prepare you for a job where circumstances are black and white
i was lucky i had a case like that to launch my career
but you are going to spend most of your time in the grey areas
Out there that is where you are to come face to face with who you really are
that is a frightening thing to ask of you
it might take a lifetime to figure out
for me i know i have two things
i know i still have complete faith in the law
and i also know i am fallible
and i just hope God is not finished with me yet
for you it is going to depend on who you are right now
if you are in it for the hustle
i guarantee you you are going to come across a case that you actually believe in and you are going to lose it
it is going to break your heart and you will be damned
if you think you are a saint i guarantee you you are going to come across a case where you are going to have to make a deal and you are going to win it
and that will break your heart and you will be damned
so you might as well believe in it from the beginning
Hurts less that way
if you get tired get out because i will fire you
if you find that the funny stories are starting to matter more than the case get out or i am going to fire you
and if God forbid you wake up one day and you just do not care anymore then please just get out
because then i am going to really have to fire you
but if you are ready to take that kind of risk
welcome
and as an old retired cop used to say to me
Nail it
and good luck to you allyou think you have had a bad day at work
i think i got you beat
that is not me
Nope
that is my partner
Suck it
there i am
Three or four days ago i did not know this world existed
Three or four days ago i was not in the Rest in Peace Department

we weren't looking for it
but it happened
the way i see it you do it for Julia for your future together
it is simple

i am not going to risk that
i am sorry buddy

Being a dirty cop
is one of the higher shot in the face percentage jobs
that is not who i am
Really
Pretty boy
How'd it feel as you were headed towards judgment
Comfortable
Feel like you were bound for glory
or were you a little worried that you were goin' down
i thought so
you are lucky Nick
you have skills that we want
so we are giving you a choice
you can take your chances with judgment
or you can join the R i P D
the R i P D
Rest in Peace Department
i get it
it is cute
Simply put we find dead people that have managed to escape judgment
we ship them off back down to where they belong
Tour is 100 years

Your home turf

Bottom

you really gonna rummage through that
Brief after action report
you were below average within the room
but you did respond well to my steering during the airbone portion
Your internal organs provided me a very soft landing
you have a very impressive crumple zone
with the exception of letting yourself get attached directly to the beastie
Stop talking
you were solid
C plus
Stop talking
Stop it
Stop it
Stop talking
you are the one who is talking
you ran your mouth at my funeral
you ran your mouth when you pushed me out of a building
you have run your mouth non stop since the minute we met
no
no
no
Shut up
Shut up and let me deal
oh
you deal
you deal with the up chuck
Come to think of it
with all this tantrummery
i am begining to think that i might have been a little too generous with the plus on that C
i might just have to lower your grade
Relax body
my hat
my hat
my hat
New grade F
Bus i can forgive
my hat

Go
Go

and my ass is mine and mine alone
Eagerly noted
Come on
it is flat anyway
Roy
Narwicky was trying awfully hard to protect this gold
do not you think we should try to figure out what it is
Trust me it is nothing
Ninety nine percent of these things are just fundraising items for various religions
Just crap
what about the one percent
that is why we lock' em up in here
Bag it tag it and bury it deep
that all of it
that is it
Sign here please
Roy
Listen
what
Narwicky cared an awful lot about that gold
yeah
he was trying to hide it from us
Why
oh so now you are all gung ho huh
i am
i am thinking we should follow up
Let me guess Genius has a plan
Genius wants to get out on the street and work this
i think that you could help me with that
you know why
because every great cop that i have ever known
has their own informant
Big Roy
i mean Big Roy you gotta have one
you want an informant
Big Roy's got the best informant
Red socks
Number 34
David Ortiz
Elliot
he is a pain in the ass Dead'O
all he cares about is the socks
so i will let him stick around in exchange for information
here
you are in mourning
got a hole to fill
you know i can not taste anything

you are dead
R i P D do not eat we do not sleep
we are here to kick Dead'O ass
that is about it
then why would you eat this
i enjoye the mouth feel

Knock yourself out
hello Elliot
one of your buddies was willing to get erased for this
Why
Rook
that belongs in evidence
i thought you were some kind of rebel Roy
i fought for the North
would you mind terribly if i got back to my investigation
Go continue your investigation
Tell me what this is Elliot
that looks like a big hunk of gold
Hahaha
it is not gonna cut it
Try again
Hey
Hey
Get your hands off me
you behave yourself now Elliot
' Cause of me you are sitting there all cozy and not lyin' in a pine box
not walkin' the desert tryin' to get your femur back from the coyote
you cops are all the same
Always obssesin' about how you bit it
how was your funeral newbie
Did you cry
when they gave your wife that nice folded up flag
Haha
Hey

i think we both know there is no red socks on the other side
so why do not you cooperate
i apologize for my poor attitude
may i take a closer look Sir
you may
yeah look i am sorry to disappoint but this is crap
Look Dead'Os they are sentimental
Lot of'em believe in this talismatic junk
if it was something else there'd be some chatter out there
i would know
Alright

These hats are crap
Keep your ears open for me
yes Sir
you gave him the gold
you see him squirm
we got him

What'd we get
Tell you what he got

'Cause that looks exactly like your ex partner
the one who shot you dead

i am interested
Color me interested

Let me think
Just let me think

the man's just screwin' you left and right
Your own partner

the trifecta
Sleeping with your wife
' Cause this is your house is not it
Total humiliation
Justa pants down spankin' in the supermarket

End of story
Why would the Dead'Os want it

it was just money to me i was trying to make our life better
Alright you did a good job of that did not ya
Why do not you go try the Chinaman thing again
Explain it to her that went well
Try it again

Tighten up
my wife sees me as a piece of shit
Actually she sees you as an old Chinese guy and by the way granpa Chin's a pretty solid look
Helps with stakeouts
the only thing i ever cared about is what she thought of me
is all that matters
the only thing what she thinks
that is who i am
i blew that
Destroyed it
Boo hoo
' Scuse me
you heard me Boody hoo
you might be the worst person i have ever met
Sadly you do not get to tell her how you did it all for her
and where exactly do you think you tragedy ranks on the scales cosmic of injustice
Pakistan earthquake level
Killing fields level
to me it was pretty big
you are think you are the only who was cut down in his prime
you think i felt unresolved as my face was being devourd by a buzzard
oh Christ
you are just gonna have to learn to sit on your regret and pain until it turns into a dull persistant ache
the way i do it
the way a man does it
i do music videos home phone number's on the back
Excuse me
i am not a piece of meat put on this earth for your gratification
i am a woman
Respect me or i will castrate you like a three year old steer
Look sharp we got somethin'
oh yeah that is a Dead'O
that has got to be Hayes' fence
you stay on the gold
i got this
Hold up daddy's on point
no thanks
i have see you in action
you questioning my methods
you do not have a method
Excuse me Sir quick word
Freezer
Allow me
my bad
Let me guess R i P D huh
Great looks man
you and your Panda Express and
Easy with the racial
you with your magnificent breasts
Watch it
Hey sideburns tell us about the gold
Look we are all friends here
Let's help each other out
you do not wanna get popped and i do not wanna pop ya
oh you do not
no
so you are just gonna give us that case you are gonna start talkin' and then you get to keep roamin' around
with your bitchin' ginger sideburns
you know what
i am sick of hiding
Whoo
Thank you
Ah thank you very much
that is better
Hahaha
Hell yeah
Let's do this
Contain
Contain
did not contain
Suck it
Aww
Straight butt
Come on
Rodeo time
Cowboy's got some ropin' to do
okay
are you okay
Somebody call 911
i am okay
nothing to see
Gotta go
Kid
Aim for the head
Still here you son of a bitch
Ow my ass
what is that
Woohoo
Coming through
here i come
yeah
Hahaha
Relax body
Woo
Rook
over here
if its not too much trouble
Thank you very much
i have never seen one like that before
never
never before has this happened
Congratulations guys on your unprecedented cock up
you let an exposed Dead'O loose on the streets
in the middle of the day
you are supposed to contain
that is your most basic job you failed spectacularly to contain
Right sweety pie it was different
we have evidence there is more to this than a bunch of
do not get creative
you do as you are told
when you do not this happens
Terrifying whatever rampaged through the streets of Boston today was not human
now look where we are
you get to deal with them
who in this endless stream of freaks is them
Eternal Affairs
Hammer's droppin'
Well
they are pissed
Justifiably however apparently you have stumbled upon something important
do not act so surprised honeypot
the gold that Officers Pulsifer and Walker brought in are part of an incredibly dangerous artifact known as the Staff of Jericho
oh crap
Maybe feather it in for the new guy
a little bit
Remember the tunnel we pulled you out of when you died
that is the only way to get to the afterlife
Its a one way street
this artifact if built reverses the tunnel
the dead reign down on the earth that is it for the living world
yep
Massive destruction
we broke it to pieces 3000 years ago
now it is back
Till we get the rest of the gold we are on red alert
Also apparently you need the blood of thine enemy
there are more diagrams
Why
Why
Why would someone make somethin' like that
Come on
here i am whittlin' the streets into order
Making headway
Year after dominant year
and now everything i have done is being threatened because of some ancient totem forged for kids by some asshole 5000 years ago
Why even try
i mean how am i supposed to do it
Look at you so proud of yourself
i got an important'tude
what
Well
what is it
Actually
it looks like you two do not need to concern yourselves with the red alert
it brings me no pleasure to inform you that because of your recent Epic Failure you have both been suspended
you are off the case
Woah Hold on a second
we are the case
we are the ones who brought it in
Well the feeling is that luck was involved
there will be a formal hearing tomorrow after which you will most likely be erased
Erased
so in this moment of crisis they are going to suspend and then erase their best Officer
and this other guy
Better Officers are taking over
no such thing
Name one
Jacobson Dubo Watterson Carson Jackson
C'mon
he is pretty good
that guy who works at the taco cart
shall i go on
okay okay
so tomorrow is my last day
most likely
i am sorry
Well it is a shame
Miss Proctor it is been a delight
Roy Thank you very much for your mentorship i am sure it meant a lot to you
i got somewhere more important to be
who are you
Why are you following me
Stay away from me
i haven't left you
it is me
no
so
Congratulations you finally did it
you get what you wanted
i might get erased tomorrow what do you think i am gonna do
you are freaking her out if you haven't noticed
Ah i am not from a time of sensativities and emotionalism
and yes in my day i bought my love by the hour
but i do know that what you are doing is not helping
Its called haunting Hoss
you are causing her pain
Why do you think we are here
Why we do what we do
it is so that Julia can have a world to live in
and yeah that means without you
she needs to survive you meet someone new maybe have a family
because YOU are not coming back
Ever
the job is all you have now
but we do not have the job anymore
Nick resolve your crap
do like me
Like you
yes emulate my piece
Your Zen like calm
Hey its taken me a very long time to acheive this state
you could get there too but for your weakness
you know what
i have had it
i can not listen to one more self righteous chesnut out of your mouth
i do not want to live in your weird past with you
Speaking which those coyote's who ate your bones and crapped out your face
in that story the coyotes are the heroes
Hey you may think the Old West was all shits'n giggles and sasparilla and two cent whores
it was not
it was smelly
it was violent
it was ridden with dysentery no count injuns
i have had a lot of anger to get past
okay
and you you need to bring a lot of shit out that i have been suppressing for a very long time
one of them coyotes he made love to my skull
do you know what that practice is commonly called
i do
and i certainly hope he got both eyes Roy
Song is called better man
yeah i got that
Maybe i took things a little too far
Maybe
i am sorry
you oughtta take up an instrument Nick
may be a tuneful way for you to spend what my be your last moments
you are were right about the job Roy
we gotta get back out there
Sus pen datto
they want me back they are gonna have to beg
i am not going to take this lying down
you
you gonna sit there and mope or do you wanna help me stop the you know an apocalypse
you put it that way hell you kinda banked me into a corner
i know Hayes is sittin' on some of that gold
there is no way he is just a bagman
Let me ask you somethin'
Did he like Indian food
he is not a fan
but somethin's buggin' me i rode with this guy for 5 years
i never noticed any kind of
Soul Stank
i heard talk of a rare kind of artifact that could mask it
Like a spiritual deodorant
be something he carried with him all the time
Like grandma's St Christopher medal
That'd do'er
Let's go pop the son of a bitch
you know what to do
oh yeah
been waitin' a long time for this
you been waitin' a long time
do you know how many years Dead'Os have been trying to pull this off
3000
not one of those jack offs could get all that gold together
Until me
R i P D's not gonna know what him'em
now go find yourself some trouble
my pleasure
Hey
Julia
Hey i need to talk to you
something really strange happened to me
what is going on
i was at the track last night and do you remember the guy at the funeral

Alright slow down slow down
Take a deep breath
i do not know somehow i feel like its Nick who is trying to talk to me

where is the rest of the gold Hayes
See what i mean
Won't let it die
Hey Nick remember when i got shot

Wild i guess you did not pull through

Hey let me ask you something what do you think eternal punishment's gonna be like Hayes
Hell can kiss my ass

Despites my chicken shit suspension

Castatrophic mistake

Take a seat

Whatevers waitin' for you on the other side is gonna be bad

Stash this gold with the rest of it

Hey

Gonna need to fill out another form
I'd love to
there is one decent thing about being a Dead'O right
we can not hear certain frequencies so well
Nope
Roy

Come on Nicky you thought I'd just let you bring me here

Dammit
Its jammed
Just like Main Street Dodge City
them dudes they picked the wrong venue to make a stand
i invented this shit
Hot
Fixed it
yeah
Let's learn you a few things about old west fighting
first Only a novice hides in a church steeple
Its the first place i am gonna look
second place
Hotel window everytime
i guess there is only one novice in their crew
sometimes the window guy is on the roof
Haven't seen that before
must be the massive destruction Proctor was talkin' about
Saddle up
Hey Julia
Hayes sent us to give you a lift
Guys i can still drive
it is pretty hairy out there
he is just worried about you
Close it up
Alright lock it up
Nobody gets through to the Commonwealth building
Nobody
Look's like the big one's right over the Commonwealth building
that is where he will be heading
yeah good read
you agreeing with me that is weird
yeah feels strange
Kindda tingly
Dead'Os on wheels
oh that is disappointing
i was hopin' to get a little break here
Make it go away Nick
i got it
Holy shit
Aaarrrggghhh
huh
that actually scared the shit outta me
Get the gold up top
i gotta wait for the final piece
Hey
you okay
what the hell is going on
Lots is goin' on
i am glad you are here with me
we need to get inside
Listen there is something i should tell you
Its
Its something i have been hidin'
Bobby i think it can wait and it might seem a little weird but i think you should just try to keep an open mind and not judge right away okay
oh ho
Ah
Skycam 4 is on the scene with continuing coverage
we are looking down on the Commonwealth Building which is swarming with there is really no other way to say this
Monsters
i urge everyone to stay inside until this situation
oh Shit
Thank you
Looks like they built a barricade
Aaand there is fat Elvis
Hit him in the the jiggly
not bad
Buzz off
can not shake me
Still hurts dicks
Relax body
Relax body
Hope they have an elavator
Aww
Shit
Reverse the tunnel
the dead come pourin' back
we stay here forever
Kind of a high five moment
all we gotta do is fire up this bad boy
yeah
okay
this is where it gets a little uncomfortable
there is no great way to say this so i will just say it
These ancient things they often involve an element of
i do not wanna say human sacrifice but human sacrifice
i will jump before you can even touch me
Julia come on
Come on be cool
this is an honor
i am trustin' you with the heavy shit
Julia
Aha
Just in time
Bobby
do not
no
Shit
Nice shot
i am gonna get Julia
you take care of the Staff
that golden pecker's comin' down
you frosty
Icy hot partner
what now Nick
you know it did not have to be Julia but i just could not resist bringin' it full circle
Come on works good right
Get over here
how is it coming Roy
it is harder than it looks
Killing you never gets old Nicky
Anytime now
i hear ya
Come on Roy
do some cowboy stuff
Please
Roy

no
Well partner
i have a new partner
i missed you
i missed you so much
i am sorry
i am so sorry
it is okay
you are back with me now
that is all i wanted
but not like this
Julia you gotta live your life
without me
i do not wanna say goodbye
can not stay here
it is okay
Go
i will always love you
Good bye
she is gonna be okay
Thank you
you owe me for that
Let's saddle up
Sure
i would like to be allowed to design my own medal
not so fast
the Eternals went ahead and had your disciplinary hearing without you
while we were saving the world
Nick as a new recruit you have been let off with a warning
Reasonable
Roy as punishment
Punishment
yes
53 more years have been added to your term
53 years
that is
that is a lot
this is honky tonk bullshit
you just like having me around don'tcha Mildred
my hat
Ha
you went off and found it
i guess i could have bought you flowers once or twice
i like violets
she Billy Goated me
Somethin' we used to do
Aww
she covers up them ankles with those damn white boots
never understand
53 more years huh
Well i still got some things to work on
Hell this is the third time i have been extended
oh say
got you somethin'
what is this
i know you weren't happy with grandpa Chin so i pulled a few strings
got you some new ID
Thank you
Thank you Roy
i mean that
this is great
oh you got to be shitting me
Ah
Did what i could inventory is what it is
you thought this was an improvementPreviously on Stargate SG 1
Colonel Maybourne sir NlD
General Hammond request permission to beat the crap out of him
i am not gonna hit you Maybourne
i am gonna shoot you
Why did not you try to escape when you were with me
Come on Jack
you trusted me
you rat bastard
Hey take it easy
i am so gonna kick your ass
Gonna turn me in
Actually that overwhelming desire to shoot you has come back
i helped myself
i hope you do not mind
you are eating my dog
you want it back
would you like a beer to wash it down
Already got one
what are you doing here
i can not drop by a friend's house for a barbecue
Well there is that little treason thing
have me arrested
that is why i am here
this is gonna be good is not it
the administration is coming to the end of its second term
i was hoping the president might consider one of those special pardons they do when one doesn't care about re election any more
Really good
i heard what happened with Prometheus
what are you talking about
Nice delivery
yeah i gotta work on that a little
Simmons used the Goa'uld in Adrian Conrad to hijack the X 303
he intended to fly to a planet with a cache of alien weaponry
i was really broken up when i heard Simmons died
yeah we all shed a tear
what you do not know is the planet Simmons was intending to fly to has a Stargate
Simmons knew
Sure
it proved easier to grab the X 303 than take and hold the SGC just to use the gate
oh the NlD's known about this planet for a while
i do not have to explain why they did not tell you
instead they are hoarding a secret that could save the planet
oh i am sure they would have come clean if push came to shove
but the address can be yours right now for what is behind door number one
a presidential pardon
this is the full price package Jack
i wanna go with you on this one
you must have had a few
Look i know you have questioned my methods in the past but we were fighting for the same thing
i just wanna help make the world safe from the Goa'uld
Nice delivery
Well thanks for the beer
nothing i like more than a good wiener
yes you are what you eat
Guess i won't be needing this any more
what is it
the address to the planet with the Ancient weapons
for God's sake
Won't do you much good without me
Why not
Simmons also did not know that there is an impenetrable doorway protecting the weapons storage facility
and i have the key
Did he say how he came across this key
Nope
it is doubtful the Pentagon would authorise Maybourne's presence on a mission
should we not explore the planet to which he provided the address
he did risk his butt just to make the proposition
Maybe we can get through without him
if Maybourne thinks it is worth a pardon what is on the other side must be good
do it
there is nobody home
are you able to translate any of this
it is not Ancient but it is a language of one of the races of the Ancient Alliance
Nox
Asgard
Furlings
oh no
not those guys
Why
oh i do not know
i just can not imagine cute little furry things making big powerful weapons that is all
i do not even know what they look like
Furling sounds cute and fuzzy to me
this section says something like Only the righteous may pass
this looks like where Maybourne's key would go
i am getting energy readings
there is a power source in this arch
here
Sir
this is definitely something
what
i do not recognise the technology
but can you make it work
General Maybourne's story checks out so far
there is a doorway there that Carter thinks might be a transporter
but she can not get it to work without Maybourne's key
what do you recommend
Jack
Harry
i am trusting you
you turned yourself in
what happens from here on out is up to you
you can remove the cuffs Airman
General
Nice to see you again
despite your prior transgressions you have been willing to help us out recently
that is why the president is willing to proceed in this matter
you are welcome
Let's see what you have brought
when do we leave
i leave right now
we will let you know how it turns out
Jack
i thought i was pretty clear
i go with you or no deal
Harry you are under arrest
i have got the stone and i am walkin' out that door
you are not in a strong bargaining position
the mission will only be successful if i am on it
that stone is useless without the combination
how is that
it was originally found over 80 years ago in a pharaoh's tomb in Egypt
it was wrapped in a scroll with writing on it that no linguist could decipher
i was recently able to get it translated though
by whom
it contained instructions for how to use the stone to access the power of the gods
that information exists in one place
Right here
a deal's a deal
you wanna go through the door i am gonna be the one who opens it
there is gotta be more going on here than he admits to
of that i have no doubt sir
but if he is not willing to tell us we can not force him
as much as I'd like to try
now this is more like it
shall we
yes
you know the real reason i wanna do this
i have never actually been through this thing before
Really
i ran the offworld operation from Earth using a Goa'uld communicator
Nervous
me
no
i am just taking a moment
Done
yeah
Good
Carter
Colonels
Major
Jonas
he finished cataloguing the writing and went to do a sweep with Teal'c
he translated everything
he needs some reference from the SGC
he says it will take a while
Harry
Right
what
i am sure i got it right
Harry
it should have worked
Let me take a look
God
Harry
you rotten no good for nothin'
Jack
you son of
Jack
Major Carter
what happened
where the hell are we
Dammit why'd you have to do that
where is the zat
i do not know
i do not have it
where is it
it is not here
i guess it did not come through with us
Why not
how should i know
Maybe the doorway filters out weapons
Goa'uld weapons
you listen to me
i want a straight answer from you
since you are here
i might as well just show ya
Hey
Come on
i am getting nowhere here
Jonas head back to the SGC
Ask General Hammond to send up a UAV
if O'Neill has activated his tracking device we should be able to pinpoint his location
you could not just let me go
you shot me
Zatted
i am not goin' back you know
where
Anywhere
to the Stargate or Earth
what are you talkin' about
Maybe they got a way to send you back
no one's supposed to leave
that is part of the deal
who are you talkin' about
the people at the place we are going
have you lost your mind
if you are suffering i will put you out of your misery
it is an alien Utopia
According to the scroll it is supposed to be paradise
what
a long time ago some people from an advanced alien society they chucked it all and they formed this isolated Utopian community
they met and evaluated people from all over the galaxy and offered them a chance to join'em
the scroll and the stone were the invitation
and this is nothing to do with the weapon Simmons was after
i figured it was my only way of getting through the gate
you know Harry it is not that i can not believe you lied to me again it is that you lied to me again
Come on
no one would have let me through the gate for this
would you have even believed me
you are sure this is all worth it
could not be much worse than where i have been hiding lately
they are closing in on me
besides i got nothin' left on Earth any more
the money i was to get from selling the Russian symbiote to Adrian Conrad was my last shot at making a life on Earth
do something good
it turned into a disaster
of massive proportion
i am tired of runnin'
Why should i when i can have a chance of retiring in paradise
i see trees Harry
you get that in Colorado
Ready for launch sir
Thank you Sergeant
Still nothing from Colonel O'Neill and Colonel Maybourne sir
they have been gone over two hours now
we are ready to go
Sir I'd like to apologise
what for
i allowed Colonel Maybourne to take my weapon
Major let's just focus on finding them right now
yes sir
you are so lost
no
i am sure this is the right way
how is that
it is in this valley
what is strange is there is no greeting party
that is all that is strange about this
they are supposed to know when someone uses the gate
i was expecting a welcome
Mai tais leis
Well something
Cabana boys
i tell ya Maybourne i do not hear any steel dru ms
how old was that invitation
there is no one here
i noticed that
Harry
this in the brochure
this technology's unlike anything we have come across
i know
we have no reference no way to interface
i am working on it Doctor
as you should be
Right
i guess i can see why you'd wanna retire here
Given your choices
Find anything that might be a doorway back
no
are you gonna kill me
i will sleep on it
i do not think we are walkin' outta here
no way of knowin' how far we were transported
we could be on the other side of the planet
which is why we survive here until we are rescued
Until we are rescued
Jack
this place is supposed to be a secret
the doorway was designed to keep it that way
of course we have the only key known to man
the least you could have done is eat that before you got here
we are gonna need food and drinkable water
i have been drinkin' the lake straight up
that is smart
i am not dead yet
it is early
Jack they are never gonna find us
i covered as much territory as the UAV's range allows
have you received word from the Tok'ra
yeah
they did not know when one of their operatives would be able to help us
what are they doing
they have completed their analyses
Excuse me
where is Colonel O'Neill
i do not see him do you
Did you guys find him while i was gone
we have been here for a week
we could all spend the rest of our natural lives trying to figure out how this thing works
but you know what
Even if i could snap my fingers and turn it on
i doubt whether it would determine where it sent Colonel O'Neill
I'd bet anything that the targeting data is in the artefact that Colonel Maybourne used to open that doorway
i say when we are done here
with all due respect Major
i will submit my report to General Hammond
if he is prepared to commit to a long term analysis project i am happy to come back
but until then if you will excuse me
anything
a couple of nibbles
they are down there though
Sleep OK
no
you
when we first came here i thought it was quiet
now it is like i can not keep the noise out
Insects animals
i keep hearing things
they are called birds
no no no these are weird sounds
we are on an alien planet
yeah
Jack i can not live on this stuff
Tastes like arugula
i hate arugula
do not eat it
we have to eat
if you keep standing there yakkin' away i am not gonna catch anything
what was that
that is just wrong on so many levels
do not ever do that again
you are sayin' you do not hear things
no
last night i swear i heard someone runnin' around out here
i spent an hour wanderin' around tryin' to spot'em
Animals
no tracks
you are losin' your mind
you do not find things spooky around here
Made so only by your presence
yeah well
i am beginning to wonder if some of the Utopians might still be alive
there is no evidence of that
Maybe they are here in another way
all right now you are gettin' spooky
Come on Jack you have seen stranger things
other dimensions planes of existence
you said it yourself this is an alien planet
so what do you want me to do
Give me your nine mil
no
Come on
you got the P 90
you sleep with it beside you
i just wanna be able to protect myself
Forget it
Jack
i want that gun
Forget it
you do not like it here deal with it
it is your own damn fault
you would not care if i died would ya
what
some alien creature comes in and attacks me in the night hauls me out while you are sleeping
you and i are the only ones here
Trust me the only thing you have to be afraid of around here is me
yeah
a satellite capable of pinpointing O'Neill's tracking device can cover a greater range
the Tok'ra could retrieve it later so the actual cost would be minimal
Compared to what
to not getting the satellite back
what about the delivery system and the manpower required to get it through the gate and then reassemble it
Sir i do not think you can place a value on Colonel O'Neill's life
no but
Unscheduled offworld activation
we will continue this later
we are receiving a transmission
Audio only
this is Jalrow of the Tok'ra
to whom am i speaking
General Hammond
Major Carter Teal'c and Jonas Quinn are also here
Major i received your message regarding Colonel O'Neill
do you have a ship that can scan a planet
yes
i have already taken the opportunity to fly over the planet in question
there were no detectable human life signs
are you sure
Quite sure
i am very sorry
Thank you
Hammond out
Jalrow out
Maybourne
Major Carter
this is the women's locker room
it appears there is no one else here but you and you are fully clothed
True
are you all right Major Carter
i am fine yeah
have you given up hope of finding O'Neill
Hope
no
but i am starting to think Dr Lee is right
i do not think the doorway is the answer
it is been almost a month Teal'c
if there were a way back
it just
it feels like we just lost Daniel and i do not know if i can
Argh
Argh
God
Argh
you shot me
i did not know you were there
Stay back
Put that down
you wanted to kill me from the start
Screw you Maybourne
i was joking
Look what you did to my leg
i set the trap for the pig
with a grenade
where are you goin'
Harry
i found somethin'
Stop eatin' that plant
it is messin' with your head Harry
Screw you
Argh
General Hammond says he is considering new SG 1 leaders
you included Major
we know
do you have anything
yeah
yeah i was finally able to come up with some photos of that artefact that Maybourne got his hands on
it is quite old making the scroll a bit difficult to read
i am pretty sure that the markings on the stone are just decoration but
Teal'c wind back that tape
Stop
there
that was the first day we were there
it was invisible after that
i forgot it was even there
what
the moon
the doorway device doesn't use wormhole technology
it was not designed to send you across the galaxy
we thought they'd been sent somewhere on the planet but they have been sent to that moon
how do you know that
the big circle is the planet
the little circle is the moon
the line between them is the path of transportation
Hey
Hey
it was a Goa'uld
he could not bring a weapon through that door so he brought a plant
it is some kind of drug or something
Maybe it was an experiment
Maybe it was supposed to get the people to serve him
i do not know but it backfired
These people they all killed each other because of that plant
you are paranoid
it is messin' with your head
i am not tryin' to kill you
Drop it
Drop it now or i will shoot you
i am not tryin' to kill ya Harry
you are losing a lot of blood
if i do not do something right now you are gonna die
some retirement this turned out to be
how are ya doin'
my head's a little clearer
how long have i been out
i do not know
a day or so
i really screwed up did not i
it is not your fault
None of the people here could stop themselves
Right from the beginning
Sorry Jack
i never should have dragged you into this
yes Harry you have been a very bad boy
Hey do not you die on me now
what difference will it make
because we are about to be rescued
oh that is nice
is not it
i can not go back
I'd rather die here than spend the rest of my life in jail
yeah um
i have been givin' that some thought
i think you suffered enough
Hell i even got to shoot ya
twice
i think the Tok'ra should be able to find a nice planet for you
Thanks Jack
Sure Harry
Sure

Stephanie Donohue
ENGLlSH www tvsubtitles neteveryone was waiting for the sun to rise on the last day of the Carnival
when the Serpent would sing her song
the people gathered around the castle gates
the shoemaker was to play the scarecrow the landlady the witch and the bailiff would take the role of Satan
the serpent started to sing and everyone knew what they had to do
Greetings knight of the sword
Arian we have been offered a job in Huarte
Princesses Naiara and Ainara had been separated by their father who unconcerned with his daughters'hearts married one to the King of the North and the other to the King of the South
Unable to cope without her sister the little princess could go on no more Ainara died of a broken heart
the serpent was afraid that Naiara would meet the same fate
it was then that the Serpent called me
and so sword in hand i set off to free the princess
what are you doing here
you will have to improve your irrintzi
are you crazy
you will wake the whole town up
yes i am crazy about you
and therefore Emc
okay let's see this relativity stuff is much easier than it looks
no honestly it is
what Einstein was saying is incredibly simple
he did not mean everything's relative quite the opposite
i e some things are and other things are not
Come in
Today's class is going to be a special one
this is Arian
this is Mikel and they are going to show us a video
Well Saturday's a protest day there is a demostration for the State to move the prisoners to Basque Country
Listen I'd rather everyone stayed to watch
you will all be free to express your opinions afterwards
the demo's at 5 p m in Castle Square
we are here to tell you about the Alternative Democracy
the media boycott means people are unaware of what ETA proposes to resolve the conflict between Spanish State and Basques
we just want you to be informed
anyway we won't go on anymore here is the video
since her birth 30 years ago
ETA has been at the forefront of the Basques'fight for the independence of the Basque Country
ETA has been spreading her ideas for an Alternative Democracy
this program is a reflection on this peace proposal
ETA's proposals are similar to the KAS Alternative twenty years ago
Why do you do this to me Antonio
you could get us into trouble for this
Turn the video off please and tell them to leave
you are the headmistress you tell them
Antonio we have talked about this before
Put yourself in my shoes for once
what is up
she wants you to leave
i am sorry this is not allowed in a public place
we do not hurt anyone we are just presenting information
Say we walked in off the streets if you like
I'd really like you two to leave right now
if you are scared that is your problem
Antonio's the one who will have to take any flack
so call the cops if you like
where have you been
you know where i have been the demonstration
Demonstration
all you ever do is smash up things
here set fire to my car next time
do you think i enjoy myself
that i have a good time
who else will act if we do not
you have not been yourself since you met that man
that guy's brainwashed you
that guy happens to have a name and he is got guts
Ana called
she is got a job in Barcelona
Why do not you spend a few days with her
you always used to do everything together
Forget it Mum i am not going anywhere
the soup's cold now
Go to the kitchen and heat it up
BAYONNE France
for fuck's sake Vivaldi turn that shit off
you lack the sensitive touch Jose
i have talked with Koldo
we have got work
Take a look
a girl
they reckon it will give us more publicity
you mean they have decided to go into marketing
we will need extra people
Wait Inaki wait
we will be finished in no time you will see
what a face
it stinks though having to get a bloody state document
it is quite morbid
sometimes you talk nonsense
Imagine you are a spy like Mata Hari
no your friend Maite is the Mata Hari round here
you could be one too
we need IegaI people for information tasks
i thought you'd never ask
i want you to think about it
i already have
Being in Jarrai is not the same as being in the organization
i know
We'd be able to spend more time together
my mind's already made up
she is coming this way
what are you doing
you idiot
it was a cover
Bloody hell
i do not like Paco
he is a bit crazy but he is useful
where did you get him from
Jose knows about him
we could go to Cuba for a bit when all this is over
Cuba
yeah
People know how to Iive there
they love to chat watch Iife go by
they Iive for the day
People with no past or future
you are quite a philosopher
People used to talk to us about ideals now they just talk rubbish
yeah
the main door's impossible there is a pub and a park
we can not even get the van near
Hold it down please
the garage is the best place to do it
the ramp's private and there is a Iot of space here in front of the Iifts
Vivaldi do not smoke in my face
you know i hate it
Sorry I'd forgotten
would not be better to wait till she is outside
it is a busy street i do not think we should risk it
it is better to do it in the house
Tell your Arian to keep an eye on the visitors
we do not want to find someone else in there
Talk to Koldo
Tell him we are ready
Let's put this away
hi
hello Isabel
have you got a Iight please
yes
i am terrible with Iighters i keep Iosing them
Thanks a Iot
Mikel the police are down there looking for you
who
the police
Why me
we must move fast
Jos and Vivaldi take care of the girl
you go to Barcelona with the Frenchman
you know i can not stand the French guy
if you have a problem tell it to the guys at the top
what am i supposed to do in Barcelona
Keep the cops occupied
Use your contact
an officer if possible if not whatever you can find
an officer will do
but Jose's Iot will need an extra person
he will sort something out
okay then
i will stay in Barcelona till things have quietened down
then i will cross the border
Whatever you think's best
Come on let's go
how much is it please
anything wrong
no
i think that guy recognised me
do not be paranoid

Get off me
two secrets were waiting for me at my door
Why did you come here
where was i supposed to go
they might have followed you
she is been a complete idiot
i was not followed
you have put the whole commando in danger
you are putting it in danger with your bloody shouting
now she is here it is best she stayed
she can take Maite's place
she is only a novice
she Iearns quickly
you are thinking of yourself
i think about the whole commando
do you think i am just here to screw
it seems so
i am risking my Iife too
how Iong since we first met Jose
do you think i am stupid
can i come in
Sure
how are you feeling
Shit
Forget about Jose
he is a bit of a wanker like all men
Including your Vivaldi
how Iong were you with him
about 6 months
what went wrong
it was my fault
i am no good at love affairs
Sit down and put this on
do not Iaugh okay
what did you do before joining the organization
i was waitress in a roast chicken joint
you a waitress
yeah my family ran it
it did a good trade
Especially when i wore a Iow cut top
Why did you Ieave
Jos and Vivaldi came in to eat one day and i was not serving food for much Ionger after that
you have to do something to your eyes
what do you think
Awful
you will get used to it
have you got anything
not yet
you just use me
we both know what this fling's about
you get a morbid kick out of it do not you
Only'cause you are a cop
when will i see you again
i am not sure i will call you
are you going to screw him
Probably
Close your eyes
can i open them yet
no no
how about now

it is show time
i have been speaking to Jose
Maite's in Barcelona
we will need someone for the kidnapping
Pick it up
what is it like to kill someone
Like screwing
you do and that is that
no we are not going to kill anybody
we will hold her for a few days her family pays and it is over
yeah i know
but what is it like
some people do not feel anything
Others enjoy it
some people wet themselves
i have seen people piss themselves after shooting someone
what about you
you do not have to do it if you do not want to
no no it is not that
do not worry you really do not have to if you do not want to
it is just there is so many things you know
it is silly but the thought of not going to cinema
or do the puppet show
i know i am being stupid
the thought of not seeing mum or dad oh shit
Tell yourself it is for a cause
Hell Vivaldi i know that
Let's go
Put the keys in the letterbox
Colonel
Let's go
if you look at me you are dead
you do not know where you are heading
yes i do mum
Your father and i had to come here undercover like thieves
you are going to Iive like that for the rest of your Iife
Mum i am fighting for my beliefs
is this what you call fighting
ETA kills a colonel
he was a soldier
he was a person
i have always been ready to die for my country but never to kill for her
Mum i have got to go now
Let me go
that press Iot never get it right
they have put the Vizcaya group carried out the Hernani bombing
you will have to Ieave a business card next time
Come on give us a hand
Take some of the weight off
we are Ieaving the van in a busy area
would you rather do it
no you are the expert around here
Look out look out
Shit
Turn that crap off
it is not crap
it is Vivaldi
Bloody shit Arian
Turn that crap off
is this it
those bastards are such a bunch of amateurs
what is the matter
this is full of water
we will have to put her in the stable
we will take it in turns to watch over her
i just want to let you know this is nothing personal
it is your father's fault you have been arrested he has to pay up 1000 millions
as Iong as he does so you will be okay
what the hell happened there
you said 7 minutes and took 13
that is it
where did that car come from
the garage door was supposed to be blocked till we got out
and next time put this on
Newsflash
we inform you of a new attack by ETA
According to sources close to the Home Office lsabel Ulloa daughter of the factory owner Alejandro Ulloa has been kidnapped
lt would be the second time in the group's history that ETA have chosen a woman as their kidnap victim
Excuse me i am just receiving a new fax from the agency EFE
there is just been an explosion in the centre of Pamplona
Looks like a car bomb was placed inside the van used by the terrorists for the kidnapping
According to this fax there is been a fatality
Turn it off
the bomb was presumably aimed at the police a young man who decided to park beside the van must have caused the explosion
we have heard enough
Out i want to sit with her
she is not very good company
hardly said a word at all
we will get along fine then
we will take it in turns to take the rubbish out and bury it
i do not like her being with the girl
she knows what she is doing
she is new and that is always dangerous
you agreed to have her here right
it will be fine
Still i want you to keep an eye on her
you sound like a facist
you know Vivaldi
People like you will put an end to this organization
she is just a bit nervous
i will calm her down
a good shag that is what she needs
it relaxes them
do you love me
what are you asking that for
of course i love you
what about you
what do you think silly
i am here are not i
you are here because you are an idealist
how about you
i like taking risks
you know the Iife expectancy of a fighting activist
Five years
then it is either prison or death
i have lasted for 8 years and i still haven't made a decision
Nobody can choose can they
Choice is always unintentionaI
Hey
what
could you get the girl please

Why not
Perhaps you have to kill her
Excuse me

Just for a few minutes
Please they really hurt
Thanks

i have simulated the car's trajectory
Up untiI here the car's going the right way

you can see the shift in the tyre marks
i do not know if they had an argument or if they were going too fast

they say we trapped them and killed them point blank
what the hell do you expect
i spoke to a policeman who was at the assault
he says there were 4 in the getaway car

i want to go to Cuba
that is a good place to escape to
no it is not that
what then
People Iive for the present over there
you always were an idealist
Police investigators have identified the 4th member of the commando
Anti terrorist sources have revealed Arian lturmendi belonged to the commando
she took part in the kidnapping and murder of lsabel Ulloa
her finger prints were in the hide out and the car used in this action
i will call you back okay
Police think she might be the responsible for the shooting the industrialist's daughter
Arin lturmendi already had a police record
she was a known member of the Jarrai youths active in Pamplona at the time
though up till now she hadn't killed anyone she has led violent groups responsible for burning banks and buses
the Home Office has released the following phone numbers that anyone with info leading to her arrest
the phone numbers are 900 551 51 51 and 900 551 51 50
Ana
Ana i have brought you your favourite
Cream and
what is wrong
is anything the matter
Ana
Please talk to me
you called the police did not you
if it is any consolation i did not kill her
Patxo was driving
he argued with Jose
i managed to jump in time but they did not
and Vivaldi
i know i am really sorry
Vivaldi tait un bon gars
yeah i will never see him again
do you know what my dad said when they killed my brother
he said Iife was like an obstacle race you have to run and jump if you trip over and fall you have to get up and keep on running
Remember the guys the police found in the Lumbiere Ravine
my brother was one of them
they said it was suicide
but i have never believed it
my brother had guts and if there is one thing he taught me it is not to keep on running but keep on running faster
Tomorrow we will cross the border
we have got to appear before the executive
what for
the rules
they want first hand info
where are you going
i am meeting a contact business
i have got some news
Tell me
i am going to need something in return
more
Seriously
i need something for my bosses
after all that coloneI business we need some gore for the press
i can give you a terrorist flat but only if the news is worth it
it is worth it
Go on then
what happened at the ravine was not an accident
what
that girl Arian Iturmendi was with them
she was the one driving
she knocked them off
Impossible
they found Gorinedie's body stuck to the passenger seat Txeca's was on the back seat
the girl was driving and for some reason she jumped out of the car before drove the others off the edge
if it had been an accident we'd have found her blood in the car

i do not know
Billy and Morris were sure looking for you
that is nice
Maybe i will come back at a better time
Think tonight this place'll be jumping
Well i will be here
Wait
i have got something for you
what
a subpoena
a song Lisa and Wendy wrote
Why did not they give it to me themselves
i liked it and wanted to listen to it
they told me to give it to you when i was done
you really liked it
oh Lord
Cut
you ladies do not seem to realize how valuable my time is
you are going to make my boys look bad
Let us come up with our own steps
we tried that
Remember
you are in the best possible position you could be in
so what is the matter
Your shoes on too tight
Let's have some action
Let's have some asses wiggling
i want some perfection
i think i am going to need a drink
this ain't happening
the bitches are okay but we need something more exciting
we should be doing better
any ideas
that Apollonia babe we saw last night
Why do not we find out where she lives
i already got that
Jill gave me everything last night
what are we waiting for
Let's go
no i want her to come to me
i am the only star in town
Morris who do you think you are
i waited up all night for you
i am tired of you doing this to me
who the fuck do you think i am
Let go of me you thick headed creep
such nastiness
Let's go
Give me that
that
on your boot
Hey wait
Give it back to me
you can have it later
i want it back now
who gave it to you
a person
Male or female
you are lying
i can tell just by your reaction you are lying
so you gave it to me
it is not yours anymore
do you see something you like
Let's go
where do you come from
New Orleans

i heard about the club and i thought I'd try my luck
you are in the business

first Avenue is really famous
a lot of bands make it after playing there
it must be really exciting

Making it
It'd be nice for a change
it is all i dream about
and you
what do you dream about
will you help me
no
Pardon me

Want to know why

i would not have gotten in that water
Come on

Did you hear it

he probably dropped it under his bike and rolled over it
Wow
all right
you think about this
i will be honest with you
i think you are being full of shit
Forget it Wendy
Let's get out of here
every time we give you a song you say you will use it but you do not
you think we are going behind your back
you are being paranoid as usual
Shut up Lisa
Please
you should know by now that we would not hurt you
you should know by now that we would not put a dark cloud over your head
it is just to make you feel good
you have felt this way with us before remember
the nominees for best actress are
Fuck it Wendy
Let's break
Why should he do your music
he is been doing fine without it
next thing you know you will want to use his motorcycle
you can really hurt people
Doesn't that mean anything to you
Doesn't that make you feel like shit
Come on

NARRATOR
he was brought across in 1228
Preyed on humans for their blood
now he wants to be mortal again
to repay society for his sins
to emerge from his world of darkness
from his endless forever night
GROWLS
MAN
one more from this angle over here
Captain
what took you so long
Cross town traffic
Tell me about it
this is just like the movie
Forget it Jake it is only Chinatown
this is not a movie Schanke
this is real life
any leads on the shooters Captain
it is a hit full time and professional
Overkill if you ask me
we got three victims all Chinese huh
Excuse me
Ray Quan Immigration
Pleased to meet you Mr Quan
i am Captain Stonetree
Detective Knight Detective Schanke
the Chief has asked that we give Mr Quan and his department our full cooperation in this matter
Captain why
this is police work
Immigration huh
does that mean they are illegal
Pretty gruesome stuff for a pencil pusher is not it
yes it is detective and no they weren't legal but they were important and what do you know about the Chinese community detective
the crimes
all i know is my wife loves Moo Goo Gai Pan
has this got something to do with Hong Kong
Look detective Nancy Lee Young was going to testify against one of Hong Kong's major crime families
she was going to give us everything we needed to put them away and now
Mr Quan all three bodies found in the car were male
then Nancy must have got out of the cab alive
if she was in it
NATALlE
she was in the cab in the back seat
we found three separate blood types
two of them are accounted for the third is AB negative
and none of these lucky stiffs was AB
you got it Schanke
See the cab driver Raymond Chow and both his fares all died the same way multiple gunshot wounds
Probable cause tissue and blood loss major organ damage
Basically somebody blew these guys all to hell
any idea how badly she was hurt
oh what
i am supposed to know that
Give me a break
i got some blood samples from the cab and that is about it
if you want any more buy a Ouija board
SlGHS
i am sorry
it is been a bad day
they cut my budget all to pieces
i have got to lose two of the attendants off my shift
both of them have families and the worst of it is neither of them have anything to go to
i mean working in a morgue doesn't exactly qualify you to do anything else
Life's a bitch
and then you die
if she is still alive time is of the essence
Mr Quan i already told you
i only can afford two men on this tops
Captain we have to find her
and i am telling you i can spare these two men
we are going to need a Chinese player on this
People down there do not trust the cops and we do not speak the same language
i thought i heard you speak Chinese before
Well i know a little
have we got a Chinese detective we can bring in
Maybe i can get ahold of Wally Lee
Come on Detective the fewer people who know Nancy might still be alive the better
my people have reason to be intimidated by the gangs
Let me assist you
i do not think that would be a wise idea
Why not
i am a trained investigator
Maybe not by police standards but down at Immigration
i am considered pretty hot
SNlCKERS
Well maybe we will give it a try
okay we'd better get to it then
i think for now Mr Quan if you and Detective Schanke were to begin preliminary questioning
Right me and Mr Hot will hit the streets
Keep an eye on him
Thanks Nick
i guess we need him so do not let him get hurt and do not push too hard with the questions
Right
Babysitting detail
you got it
so when do we get started
Right away
Mr Quan Immigration normally plays these things close to the vest
How'd the hitters know what was going down
are you suggesting there is a leak
yeah i think it is a possibility
You'd do well to check your own department as well as the streets
will do
and captain we can not let the press get all over this
we have to be very discreet
do not worry about it
i will Stonetree them
Look i am going to snoop around for a little while
Go grab a coffee huh

it would be better if we did not have to live here but what better place for him to learn the evils of temptation
Urges and desires are all in the mind and the nerve that leads from the mind
you see
the mind controls all
where are you going
you must face your temptation
do not move
you move i shoot
Take it easy
i am a cop
inside my jacket in my pocket
i have got my badge
i am just going to reach inside and get it
is this your shop
and my home too
Did you see a young woman come in here
never mind who come in here
she was hurt bleeding
how i know badge is for real
Call the station ask them
no no no
do not move
you stay there
you you say you looking for young woman
what she do
nothing
she was shot
she is in danger
the people who shot her are going to try again
i have a picture
there
have you seen her
uh
i i do not like much police
Well it would be a pity to save her life just to have another person take it
uh huh
if i saved it and if I'd even seen her
she is in danger
i think i can help her
if you see her call me

what i can not figure out is why nobody down here in Chinatown talks to the cops
i mean you are Chinese
how come nobody talks to you
QUAN
we Chinese view police differently than you
the men in blue have never been considered our friends and even though i am Chinese
i am still working down here with a fan gwai
Qu'est ce que c'est fan gwai
it means barbarian
Well sort of
Barbarian
i will have you know this is an exact copy of a very expensive Italian designer suit so do not give me that barbarian stuff
it is not meant personally detective 200 bucks off the rack
it is just a fact our civilization has been around a lot longer than yours
oh civilized
that machine gun attack was civilized
Let's go in here
QUAN
are you going to get something done
you think you could do better
i could not do any worse
Problem
yeah
i have had it with this little creep
can not you get me a real detective to worth with
i will real detective you you little
that is enough
okay
what is the trouble
he is a fool trying to browbeat people in the stores
Listen i am trying to question witnesses and he will not interpret he will not cooperate and then he
no no
do not stop on my account
Sounds great really professional
Captain you were told to cooperate with me on this investigation
i am going to have to speak to the chief about this and when i return
i want another detective to work with
Ooh i am scared
i should have popped him when i had the chance
you missed a real career opportunity with the diplomatic corps Schanke
what have you got Nick
my turn
okay
i believe that Nancy Lee Young was treated at this address
it is an acupuncture shop
where is she now
i do not know
so you do not have any more idea than we do
you think she was at the needle doctor's
Trust me i seem to have a nose for these things
you got a hunch
yeah
the old guy the acupuncturist he was hiding something
i say we go down there and persuade him
you won't be doing that Schanke
i want you and Quan down there in the morning
no no i say we do not tell Quan diddly squat
there was a leak right at Immigration right
Well the worst leaks come from the top and Quan's the top
i do not have time for this
we were ordered to cooperate and that is exactly what we are going to do
you understand
all right
we got a lead that Nick gave to us and we are going to follow it up
we have got a break
Henry Rowlands confessed to the McCauliffe murders
oh that is great
yeah this morning
that means i can free up a few men for this
Nick i want you to set it up and brief them
Captain i think you should put Schanke in charge
no seriously
i mean he knows the case
he knows the street
i am not really a team player
i can do more good out there on my own
Schanke's the obvious guy to put in charge of something like this
any objections
that is it then
Way to go Schanke
Give'em hell

so we saturate the area around this acupuncture shop and do a house to house
i want everybody to keep on their toes
we are dealing with some very heavy hitters here who know exactly what they are doing
all right so just go in there smile show the picture ask the questions and get out
now i want you to call on every house
ladies and gentlemen and i can not emphasize this enough but be nice be courteous because these people have a different way of doing things than us
okay
oh yeah and if Immigration shows up tell them to take a hike
okay
Let's rock'n' roll
Nancy
Nancy are you all right
Dr Chong
i was worried
i thought something had happened
nothing happen
Just a a memory
something from my childhood
what is it
I'd better have a look
oh it is bleeding again
does it hurt
yeah just a little
Mostly i just feel so weak
Listen i brought some herbal medicine for your strength
i know it is bitter but i will give you some of my soup afterwards
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG
it will control the pain but the bullets tore her up inside
Your needles can not fix that
Please
I'd rather you did not pull the gun on me again
Call it a weakness
do not be afraid
it is all right
i am a cop
do not shoot me
Leave us alone
the best thing we can do for her is get her to a doctor
no
i won't go
no no
Calm down now
Stay quiet
i do not want to go
they are going to kill me
Nobody's going to kill you i swear
would you go over there and sit down
and do not say anything
now go over there
all right
you are disturbing her
they killed my brother my uncle
Please do not take me from here
they want to kill me too
you will be safe
we will protect you
Nobody will protect me not if they know where i am
there are so many people here who will talk
they will tell them i am still alive
Please be calm
Stay still
you know everybody here is afraid
you understand
but the police are not afraid
Police
how can i trust the police
or Immigration
someone told them where we were
someone told them
they shot us down
she needs a doctor
i am a doctor
she probably needs surgery
i will care for her with what i have learned in 60 years
Whatever i remember
yeah well i have to move her somewhere safer than here
she will not go with you
the people who shot her are still out there Chong
if you try to take her to a place where she does not want to go you will harm her and she will fight you and so will i
can you keep her safe here
i will die before i let anyone harm her
anyone
you will both be here when i get back
i have your word
we will be here
because it would be a shame for her to survive a mob attack and end up dying because of stubbornness
Stubbornness
huh
what appears to you as stubbornness is a fear of revenge
we should all be afraid of revenge
GARBLED RADlO TRANSMlSSlON
what are the red pins for
Red means possible
Jeez how many times do i
Good career move
and the green
Definite negatives
47 Mobile to base
151 Queens
Nobody saw anything
Roger
Base do you copy
Schanke
SlGHS
yeah i copy
Thanks
Out
i found her
Aw jeez
do not sneak up on me like that Knight
i can not be responsible for what might happen next
is she alive
yeah
where is she
she is in good hands
i do not care whose hands she is in
i just want to know where she is
she doesn't want anyone to know that
she doesn't trust Immigration
i knew it
or the police
is she hurt
Broken rib a couple of bullet holes some internal bleeding
we should take her to a hospital
if we try to move her from where she is she is going to fight us and then we can say goodbye to any chance of her testifying
if she won't come to us how about we roll a SWAT team out to sit on her
i do not think that is a good idea
if no one knows where she is nobody can leak it
yeah it is funny how you have taken my theory and decided to call it your own
Hey law of averages Schanke
i mean every once in a while even you have got to be right
Funny
Captain
Gentlemen
i would like to apologize for my anger earlier
this is a very important case to me
i mean Immigration
i understand Mr Quan
we were all tense
i am sure Detective Schanke will agree with that
oh yeah
yeah right
we were tense
and we have some good news
we have found Nancy Lee Young
you found her
where is she
my people have it under control and i think we will have her here shortly
i will make arrangements to have her taken to a safe house out in the country
we have to keep her alive at all costs
if you will excuse me
What'd you do that for
huh
i told you she was in a safe place
you just jeopardized all that
Did you hear me tell Quan where she was
no i did not
Look Nick
i agree with you about keeping her location secret but Immigration's in on this case too
i had to throw him something
if you are going to keep her out there on her own
i want you out there with her every second
and i want a doctor out there with her too
These are not suggestions detective
you understand
yeah i understand
Detective
where do you think you are going
i am going to find me a doctor
what are the red pins for again
EXASPERATED SlGH
i do not think this is a good idea
Come on it is like riding a bike
you never forget
Nick i do not know if i have ever told you this before but most of my patients over the last few years have all been dead
Well then this will be a nice change

you are sure
they said the girl was found
Why did not you question them
Find out where she was
they are going to bring her in
i thought I'd call you first before they bring her into protective custody
my family
when you get Nancy Lee Young you swore you'd let my family go
i said we would
we keep our word
this is remarkable
i do not think they could have done much more than this at a trauma center but she is almost comatose
my needles have made her asleep
Well medically that is about all she needs
Mm hmm
Obviously
for now
she will need surgery to close the internal wounds
and then you want to take her away with you
i have no choice
no
Your kind never has a choice
her only real protection is to testify
Once she puts the crime lord in Hong Kong behind bars she will be safe
Immigration will give her a new identity
they will relocate her
Set her up in business even
Mm hmm
what about her name
her past
her past will be over forgotten
the past
one never forgets his past
GROWLlNG
she will never escape her past
i know
i have never been able to
now you just relax
this is just to help you rest
Detective Knight
yeah
Why should i testify
can you assure my safety
if you say nothing the people who killed your brother and your uncle will be able to do the same to someone else
you can stop that
now just try to rest okay

POLlCE RADlO TRANSMlSSlON
Well maybe they won't believe him
he hates me Nat
i do not know why but he does and he knows he is got me
Well then get out of here
Go
it is happening again
the story of my life
if i have to leave
i will get in contact with you somehow
Hey promise me one thing
Whatever happens you won't ever stop trying to become human
Nick i have been talking to Mr Chong
you know captain he is a pretty old man
he can hardly even trust his own eyesight
i mean i know the guy shot at me but he did not hit me
i mean ask Natalie
Chong probably thought
Nick what are you talking about
Chong just asked me if you'd give him a ride home
oh
yeah
we found the leak
it was Quan
they were holding his wife and kids
they all right
yeah
Schanke persuaded one of the hoods to take him to the location
Good
Nick do me a favor
after you drop off Chong go home and get some rest
all right let's go
Well
he did not say anything
what
i will talk to you later
but
Go on
Go
Why did not you say anything
what should i have said
you could have told him what you saw
i saw you saving Nancy Lee Young's life the life i was fighting to save as well
what are you going to do now
i am an old man
i am going to rest
i have been seeking rest for long time
i will give you a lift home
Thank you
i will bring my car
Wake up
GRUNTS
Please struggle
the needles will make you suffer more
Why are you doing this
because i know what you are
you are the thing that killed my mother
Chong that is not possible
These are old eyes but they see clearly
they do not deceive me
you you were alive huh
during those days
you can not deny that
yes
i know what you are
i know the legend of Kuphue Kiongsi a drinker of blood one who
lives forever
but i have a spell that will end all that
i do not deny that i was alive when your mother was living but i have killed no one in a hundred years
Liar
i saw it with my own eyes
you killed her
you sucked the blood from her
i was only a little boy but
SPEAKlNG CHlNESE
but but i saw you
i remember as if it was only yesterday
yes yes
i remember that face through a thousand endless days
i remember that face through endless sleepless nights
GROWLlNG
you are Mai's little boy
i did not kill your mother
no no no
you do not lie
i saw you
no
you saw me holding her
i tried to help her to save her
Coward
that night
the night your mother died
i was not the only one there
there were three of us
oh Nicholas
Nicholas when will you ever learn
do you think any of those needles can save you
do you think any one of them ever could
can not you leave me alone
an immovable feast
Why won't you understand
our friendship is over
no
it is forever and anyway it is not your choice
LACROlX
what are you doing Nicholas
you can not become human
Your desires are in your soul
they are immutable
DOOR OPENlNG
no
Mai get out of here
SHRlEKS
no
he killed from lust not hunger
he killed just to kill
you are what i am
SPEAKlNG CHlNESE
the memory of my mother's death demands that you pay demands that you pay with your death
Wait
there were three of us
one was a woman a beautiful woman
do you remember her
do you remember her
SPEAKlNG CHlNESE
yes i remember
i remember her
Let her come to us
Let her speak in my defense
that woman
she is alive

TlRES SCREECHlNG
oh the sun
oh Nick
MOANS IN PAlN
Nicholas
where are you
Nick this better be
GROWLS
no
10 seconds he is dead
no
then what do you want me to do
1916
we were in San Francisco remember
oh yes
how could i forget sweet Nicholas
Tell him exactly what happened
i know what happened
you killed my mother
he did not
yes he did
i saw
SPEAKlNG CHlNESE
i saw
you saw wrong
Why should i trust you
because i could kill you in an instant
he could probably have killed you too
he could have ripped your throat out but Nick has repented his ways
he tries to do good
no such thing
i saw i saw
Listen to me
Listen
Nick did not kill your mother
another of us did
now i want you to think back
i saw him holding her
i saw a man bending over my mother
and you
you were watching her
you were watching all this
you you killed her
no
on my word
the man's face
Think
Remember seeing it
i
i thought he could see me
i thought he would kill me and when he turned around i
it was not you
it was not
PANTlNG
Well
after nearly 800 years
i would have thought that you could do just a little bit better than this
Well i am a cop Jeanette
if i have too many possessions they'd think i am dirty
oh yes right
you know
i honestly do not know why you bother Nicholas
you are not human and you never will be
Ooh
may i
yeah help yourself
what is it
it is cow is not it
GASPS
Dlicieux
Ugh
SlGHS
you know Nick your life would be so much easier if you came over and joined us again for good
oh i refuse to do that
Right
instead you choose to cower before an old man a man that you could snap like a twig
Well for me it is a better life
is it really
Even though you needed me to save you
i am grateful for that
are you
then show me
Show me Nick
GASPlNG

the dogs do love us do not they no matter what pact we have made with the devil
of course darling
Animals do not understand these things
oh God
oh God
Come on
do you have it
yes i have it
Just one last wish to make things right again
no
no more wishes
but i can outwit it this time
i know what to do
how can you believe such a thing after what we have seen
this abomination raised a dead thing from its grave in answer to your wish
i can send it away again with my final wish if you will allow me just to hold it
no
no
the third wish must go unused
it is the only way
DOG BARKlNG
MRS WlLDER
Sophie
no
WHlSPERlNG
i did it Richard
you will see
i made a wish that this paw would be owned by someone who really deserved it
we are free of the curse now
but do not you see
for the paw to belong to someone else we would have to
MRS WlLDER GASPlNG
you have your wish at last my darling
we are free of the curse forever
what are those
they are for Halloween
we are a house of curios not a costume shop
Delores at this rate we will soon be paupers and no amount of Father's magic is going to change that
if we are going to survive we are going to have to expand our client base
never
i will not have nasty little children in this shop dressed up like lggy Oswald biting the heads off rubber bats
Ozzy Oswald
oh lggy Osbald
Whomever
i will not have them mocking the dark arts
would more than likely cause Father to roll over in his grave
Sorry Father
that would be novel
hello
hello
can you hear me
if you are thinking of coming back from the dead anytime soon BELL JlNGLlNG would you please let us know
' Cause we could use the space
hello
Help Marlise will you
Anybody home before she breaks something
Sorry
oh help her yourself
she is more fond of you anyway
of course she is
with an attitude like yours it is a wonder you have any human relationships at all
LaVONNE
Well at least
at least i am not in my 30s and still single
you know there is a very good reason why no man will have you and it has absolutely nothing to do with that ugly hammertoe of yours
it is because you are boring boring as Buckingham Palace
Funny but i swear i remember asking for help
of course you did darling but your sister and i were just discussing business
or the lack thereof
oh yes well business is slow
Terribly slow
Maybe it is time we reconsidered our options
no
i will not sell Mr Finger's House of Curios
i promised Father
Times change and people must change too
Let's not forget that Basil and i still have Grandmother Oakfist to feed
the money would be very helpful
i won't sell
i can not
she is terribly selfish
i did not understand why Father left her in charge
i knew we should have contested the will
i hate you
yeah well i hate you even more
in fact i detest the actual day that you were born you wretched little mistake
has it ever occurred to you that one more prophylactic to a box and it would have been just the two of us
you liar
that is not true
Look
it is a sign
Three wishes
Delores do not be daft
Basil are you going to join us
in a moment darling
the ham smells delicious
it is lamb you twit
Lamb you say
Interesting
Carry on
i will just be a minute
as i was saying that whole monkey paw business is just an old story
something Father told us as children
it is more than that LaVonne
it was in a book
yes thank you Marlise
Your literary insight is awe inspiring as always
but as most people know stories do come from books
not always
sometimes they come from newspapers
Stop your quibbling
it doesn't matter where the story came from
what matters is that the story is true
LaVONNE
Right
what if
how do we even know this is the paw
Marlise did you check with the people you purchased it from
i told you it was an estate sale
the couple was deceased
Beware the paw
it is cursed
GRANDMA OAKFlST BURPlNG
more meat
more meat
a simple please would have sufficed
do you see what i have to put up with around here
do you
it is ridiculous
what about a magazine
on occasion stories are found in magazines too
Thank you Basil
have you taken your medicine
Good
then feel free to continue embarrassing yourself as much as you like
LaVonne listen to me
i believe what Marlise said this morning is true
Father doesn't want us to sell the store
how do you know that
because he sent us a helping hand from beyond the grave
DELORES
Three wishes i give and no more
to each owner of me so keep score
each wish will come true
so take care what you do
Blast
i can not make out the rest
Let me
something illegible
Greed i deplore
it is not very friendly sounding is it
Grandmother gone to sleep
yes
Even Basil
what a shame
are you sure you know what you are doing
if i remember the story correctly those wishes had a way of taking a nasty turn
then we will just have to be smarter than the people in that book
they were greedy
Right
we will start smaller
we will be a bit more careful
MARLlSE
we won't wish for any more than we really need
DELORES
Exactly
i wish for a million pounds
a million pounds
we are as good as dead
you said start small
that is not small
yes it is in the scheme of things
do not forget that i have unlimited power here
i could have easily asked for 100 million or even a billion pounds
not that it really matters' cause nothing happened
TELEPHONE RlNGlNG
hello
yes
yes she is here
BASlL SNORlNG
Certainly
how many
Right
Just a moment please
i do not want it
i am afraid
oh shut up you bloody parrot
it is Father's lawyer
hello
what is it
LaVONNE
one of Father's shipments
yes Mr Curd was just delivered to his lawyer by a representative of the post office
Apparently it was lost in the system for over 40 years
what was in the shipment
According to the paperwork three fountain pens
yes
Fountain pens
yes
Waterford Snakes
Only four exist in the entire world
we now own three
at 250 000 apiece
how much 750 000
do you know what this means
the paw works
Except that you wished for a million
Doesn't that seem odd
oh what the hell
we are rich
we are rich
LaVONNE
yes we are
or should i say she is
Whatever do you mean
as the owner of the House of Curios the pens legally belong to her
oh but she will share with her sisters
Won't she
GlGGLlNG
do not let her out of your sight
i still can not believe it
Three quarters of a million pounds and it is all mine
to be shared with the two of you of course
Well i for one won't believe any of this until the pens are safely in our vault
oh never doubt the power of the spirit world
if Father wants us to succeed we will
i will be in the shop
Get back as soon as you have acquired the pens
Perhaps it would be better if i put the pens in my safety deposit box at the first National
Safety deposit box
when
when
since Daddy died
it was all part of the will
i thought you knew
no we did not know
Why did not you tell us
i thought i did
oh well i guess i did not think it was that important
do not you worry sweetie
those pens are as good as ours
what do you mean there are no pens
on the phone you said there were three pens
Three pens worth 250 000 each
yes well i am sorry
but as you can see for yourself there was a misprint on the shipping
what am i supposed to do with 33 waterway snakes
i am warning you Marlise stop this nonsense right now
Marlise are you listening to me
Again my condolences Ms Finger
but as i mentioned before i do have a dinner engagement
Mr Curd i do not care if you are having dinner with the Queen in your underwear
if you do not take your hands off me right now
i promise you i will personally introduce all 33 of these snakes up your large and rather unflattering arse
Out
oh stop it
Stop that blubbering you spoiled brat
do not
Leave her
RlNGlNG
where are the two of you
Car accident
are they both dead
DOOR OPENlNG
is
is Marlise dead
the doctor said she probably did not feel a thing
we were fighting on the way home
she would not stop crying
do not
can i see her
no
the car it went up like an inferno
at least you were thrown free
she would not stop crying
Stop
it gets worse
do you remember the safety deposit box
she had an insurance policy
no
oh it is all my fault
it was worth a million pounds
Exactly what I'd wished for
the monkey's paw
Destroy it
Destroy it
Promise me
i do not know if i can
DOOR OPENlNG
Read it again if you have to
you can not do it
i can
i can beat the paw
i can bring Marlise back
no you can not
that is exactly what they tried to do in the book
she wishes her son back to life but he comes to the door as he is now a rotting corpse
oh i can
i can beat the paw
Delores Marlise is gone
do not do any more damage
Give me the paw
oh no i have still got two wishes left
two wishes left
no Doctor it is not healthy
she thinks it has magical powers
it is simply a stuffed paw nothing more
DELORES
LaVonne
LaVonne
Right
Well we will see you tomorrow then
yes
Thank you
what is it
i know what the second wish should be
oh why did not i think of it before
Give that to me
DOLORES GRUNTlNG
i wish
do not that Marlise was the way she was right before the accident
TELEPHONE RlNGlNG
no
no
Answer the bloody phone
hello
Thank you
we will be right there
that was the funeral home
they said they needed to see us right away
i can not do it
i can not go down there
Fine
i will go by myself
you never cared for her
she was your sister and you hated her
as i told your sister it is very strange Ms Finger
Very strange
she is alive is not she
no
not quite that strange but strange enough
Look
i do not understand
Frankly neither do l
the police told me your sister drove her car off the road
yes the car went up in flames
she was horribly disfigured burned
Ms Finger your sister's car did not catch on fire
she drove it into the lake
she did
yes but something very odd is going on here
Somehow the police detectives missed this
Just before your sister crashed her car somebody put a bullet in her head
Your sister was murdered
Murderer
as i believe you once said Times change and people do too
Marlise told you about the insurance policy as you left Father's lawyer and you killed her
that is right
and i would have got away with it too if it hadn't been for that ridiculous paw
no you had to try and bring the little brat back
you had all the money you could ever need
but no you had to fuck with history
you are mad
no i am not
i am justified
you did not marry Basil
you did not change Grandma Oakfist's nappies every night
i did
i paid my dues
and now i want out and you are not going to stop me
Give me that bloody paw Delores
i do not want you using that last wish against me
you do not have to worry LaVonne
i have already used it
you what
oh i am not as daft as you think
i gave my wish away
i wished that the last wish belonged to my sister
you are pathetic
i do not want your wish
in fact i wish that you had your wish back
there
that is done it
no it is not because i did not tell the paw which sister to give it to
i beat it at its own ridiculous game
that twisted paw gave the wish to Marlise
SHUDDERlNG MOANlNG
GLASS SHATTERlNG SCREAMlNG
the funny thing is her wish was to spend a little more time with you

Well that is somethin'

Figurin' on goin' over the Rim tonight

i wanted to sing it to my wife last night
you know we got a boy just about Chester's age who is got a hankerin' to go to the city
have you got your dulcimer here

Tuneless
there was once a poor boy
and he left his country home
and he came to the city to look for work
he promised his ma and pa
he would lead a sinless life
and always shun the fatal curse of drink
Once in the city
he got a situation in a quarry
and there he made the acquaintance
of some college students
he little thought they were demons
for they wore the best of clothes
but good clothes do not always make the gentleman
so they tempted him to drink
and they said he was a coward
Until at last he took the fatal glass of beer
when he found what he'd done
he dashed the glass upon the floor
and he staggered through the door
with delirium tremens
Once upon the sidewalk
he met a Salvation Army girl
and wickedly he broke her tambourine
all she said was Heaven
Heaven bless you
and placed a mark upon his brow
with a kick she'd learned
before she had been saved
now as a moral to young men
who come down to the city
do not go'round breaking people's tambourines
Sobbing
that certainly is a sad song
Weeping Uncontrollably
do not cry constable
it is a sad song
my Uncle Ichabod said speakin' of the city
it ain't no place for women gal but pretty men go thar
Sobbing
he always said somethin' to make you split your sides a laughin'
Continues Sobbing
Comical old gentleman he was

Fergus no weapons on the table
can i shoot an arrow
can i
can i
can i
can i
Please
can i
not with that
Why not use your very own
Happy birthday my wee darling
now there is a good girl
Draw all the way back now to your cheek
that is right
Keep both eyes open
and loose
i missed Go and fetch it then
a bow Fergus
she is a lady
you
a will o' the wisp
they are real
Merida come along sweetheart
we are leaving now
i saw a wisp
i saw a wisp
a wisp
you know some say that will o' the wisps lead you to your fate
Aye
or an arrow
Come on let's be off before we see a dancing Tatty Bogle
or a giant having a jigger in the bluebells
Your father doesn't believe in magic
Well he should
because it is true
Mor'du
Elinor run
Sire
Come on you
some say our destiny is tied to the land as much a pan' of us as we are of it
Others say fate is woven together like a cloth
so that one's destiny intertwines with many others
it is the one thing we search for or fight to change
some never find it
but there are some who are led
the story of how my father lost his leg to the demon bear Mor'du became legend
i became a sister to three new brothers
the princes
Hamish Hubert and Harris
Wee devils more like
they get away with murder
i can never get away with anything
i am the princess
i am the example
i have got duties responsibilities expectations
my whole life is planned out preparing for the day i become
Well my mother
she is in charge of every single day of my life
Aye Robin Jolly Robin and thou shalt know of mine
Project
and thou shalt know of mine
Enunciate
you must be understood from anywhere in the room or it is all for naught
this is all for naught
i heard that
from the top
a princess must be knowledgeable about her kingdom
she does not doodle
that is a C dear
a princess does not chortle
does not stuff her gob
Rises early is compassionate patient cautious clean
and above all a princess strives for
Well perfection
but every once in a while there is a day when i do not have to be a princess
no lessons no expectations
a day where anything can happen
a day i can change my fate
i am starving
you hungry too Angus
Oats it is then
Good day Princess
i cannot find the salt
where did you put it
it was over there a minute ago the last time i looked at it
and then out of nowhere the biggest bear you have ever seen
his hide littered with the weapons of fallen warriors
his face scarred with one dead eye
i drew my sword and
one swipe his sword shattered
then chomp
Dad's leg was clean off
down the monster's throat it went
that is my favorite part
Mor'du has never been seen since and is roaming the wilds waiting his chance of revenge
Let him return
i will finish what i guddled in the first place
Merida a princess does not place her weapons on the table
Mum
it is just my bow
a princess should not have weapons in my opinion
Leave her be
Princess or not learning to fight is essential
Mum
you will never guess what i did today
i climbed the Crone's Tooth and drank from the Fire Falls
Fire Falls
they say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire
what did you do dear
nothing Mum
Hungry are not we
Mum
you will get dreadful collywobbles
oh Fergus will you look at your daughter's plate
so what
you great
do not let them lick
Boys you are naughty
do not just play with your haggis
how do you know you do not like it if you won't try it
that is just a wee sheep's stomach
it is delicious
my lady
Thank you Maudie
you are getting too big the two of you
from the Lords Macintosh MacGuffin and Dingwall
their responses no doubt
Aye aye
Hey hey
Stay out of my food you greedy mongrels
Chew on that you manky dogs
Fergus
they have all accepted
who is accepted what Mother
Boys you are excused
Hey
what did i do now
Your father has something to discuss with you
Fergus
Merida
the lords are presenting their sons as suitors for your betrothal
what
the clans have accepted
Dad
what
i
you
she
Elinor
Honestly Merida i do not know why you are reacting this way
this year each clan will present a suitor to compete in the games for your hand
i suppose a princess just does what she is told
a princess does not raise her voice
Merida this is what you have been preparing for your whole life
no it is what you have been preparing me for my whole life
i won't go through with it
you can not make me
Merida
Merida
Boys
Mother
Suitors
Marriage
Once there was an ancient kingdom
Mum
Ancient kingdom
Its name long forgotten ruled by a wise and fair king who was much beloved
and when he grew old he divided the kingdom among his four sons that they should be the pillars on which the peace of the land rested
but the oldest prince wanted to rule the land for himself
he followed his own path and the kingdom fell to war and chaos and ruin
that is a nice story
it is not just a story Merida
Legends are lessons
they ring with truths
Mum
i would advise you to make your peace with this
the clans are coming to present their suitors
it is not fair br Merida
it is marriage
it is not the end of the world
you are muttering
i do not mutter
Aye you do
you mutter lass when something's troubling you
i blame you
Stubbornness
it is entirely from your side of the family
i take it the talk did not go too well then
i do not know what to do
Speak to her dear
i do speak to her
she just doesn't listen
Come on now
Pretend i am Merida
Speak to me
what would you say
i can not do this
Sure you can
there there
that is my queen
Right here we go
i do not want to get married
i want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind
as i ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset
Merida all this work all the time spent preparing you schooling you giving you everything we never had
i ask you what do you expect us to do
Call off the gathering
would that kill them
you are the queen
you can just tell the lords the princess is not ready for this
in fact she might not ever be ready for this so that is that
Good day to you
we will expect your declarations of war in the morning
i understand this must all seem unfair
Even i had reservations when i faced betrothal
but we can not just run away from who we are
i do not want my life to be over
i want my freedom
but are you willing to pay the price your freedom will cost
i am not doing any of this to hurt you
if you could just try to see what i do i do out of love
but it is my life it is
i am just not ready
i think you'd see if you could just
i think i could make you understand if you would just listen listen
i swear Angus this is not going to happen
not if i have any say in it
MacGuffin
Dingwall
Dingwall
Macintosh
Macintosh
you look absolutely beautiful
i can not breathe
Shush
Give us a turn
i can not move
it is too tight
it is perfect
Merida
Mum
Just
Remember to smile
Aye they are coming
Places everyone
Places
i look fine woman
Leave me be
my Lord
i want to announce the arrival of the lords
who goes there
who goes there
Boy
so here we are the four clans br Aye
Gathering for the presentation of the suitors the presentation of the suitors
Clan Macintosh
Macintosh
Your Majesty i present my heir and scion who defended our land from the northern invaders and with his own sword Stab Blooder vanquished 1 000 foes
Macintosh
Clan MacGuffin
MacGuffin
Good Majesty i present my eldest son who scuttled the Viking longships and with his bare hands vanquished 2 000 foes
MacGuffin
Clan Dingwall
Dingwall
i present my only son who was besieged by 10 000 Romans and he took out a whole armada singlehandedly
with one arm he was
with one arm he was steering the ship and with the other he held his mighty sword and struck down a whole attacking fleet
Lies
what
i heard that
Go on
Say it to my face
or are ye scared simpering jackanapes afraid to muss your pretty hair
at least we have hair
and all our teeth
if he was a wee bit closer
and we do not hide under bridges you grumpy old troll
you want to laugh huh
Wee Dingwall
Get off me
Nut'em
Nut'em

all right
Shut it

you have had your go at each other
Show a little decorum
and no more fighting
you want a fresh one
Crivens you are fierce
i did not start it

my lady Queen i feel terrible
my humblest apologies
we mean no disrespect
i am sorry love i did not
but
yes dear
now where were we
yes
in accordance with our laws by the rights of our heritage only the firstborn of each of the great leaders may be presented as champion
Firstborn
and thus compete for the hand of the Princess of Dun Broch
to win the fair maiden they must prove their worth by feats of strength or arms in the games
it is customary that the challenge be determined by the princess herself
Archery
Archery
i choose archery
Let the games begin
Pull
Pull
i will just take one
now i have told you you are not allowed
it is time
Archers to your marks
Aye archers to your marks
and may the lucky arrow find its target
Oi
Get on with it
i bet he wishes he was tossing cabers
or holding up bridges
at least you hit the target son
that is attractive
i got it br Good arm
and such lovely flowing locks
Fergus br what
Wee lamb
Come on
Shoot boy
Well done lad
Well done
Feast your eyes

Well that is just grand now is not it
Guess who is coming to dinner
Fergus

Merida
Curse this dress
Merida stop this

Merida i forbid it
Michty me
i have just about had enough of you lass

you embarrassed them
you embarrassed me
i followed the rules
you do not know what you have done
Just do not care how i
it will be fire and sword if it is not set right
Just listen
i am the Queen
you listen to me
this is so unfair
Unfair
you are never there for me
this whole marriage is what you want
do you ever bother to ask what i want
no
you walk around telling me what to do what not to do trying to make me be like you
Well i am not going to be like you
you are acting like a child
and you are a beast
that is what you are
Merida
i will never be like you
no stop that
I'd rather die than be like you
Merida you are a princess and i expect you to act like one
Mum
Merida
Merida

Angus

Angus
Why would the wisps lead me here
Look around
you holler if you see anything you like
everything is half off
who are you
Just a humble woodcarver
i do not understand
See anything you like
Perhaps a touch of whimsy to brighten any dank chamber
but the will o' the wisps they
this is one of a kind
i will make you a deal for this rare prize
Your broom
it was sweeping by itself
that is ridiculous
Wood cannot be imbued with magical properties
i should know
i am a
Whittler
of wood
how about this conversation starter
it is made of yew wood
Tough as stone
that is stuffed
Staring is rude
the crow's talking
that is not all i can do
you are a witch
Woodcarver
that is why the wisps led me here
Woodcarver
you will change my fate
Woodcarver
you see it is my mother
i am not a witch
Too many unsatisfied customers
if you are not going to buy anything get out
no
the wisps led me here
i do not care
Get out
Shoo
Get
be gone with you
i will buy it all
what
what was that
every carving
Well
and how are you going to pay for that sweetie
with this
oh my that is lovely that is
that would set us up for months
every carving and one spell
are you sure you know what you are doing
i want a spell to change my mum
that will change my fate
Done
where are you going
there
what are you doing
you never conjure where you carve
Very important
the last time i did this was for a prince
Easy on the eyes
Tight pants
he demanded i give him the strength of ten men
and he gave me this for a spell
a spell that would change his fate
and did he get what he was after
yes
and made off with an especially attractive mahogany cheese board
now what do i need
Just a little bit of this
that will do
and now let's see
what have we here
Hey
a cake
you do not want it
yes
i want it
you are sure if i give this to my mum it will change my fate
Trust me
it will do the trick dearie
Expect delivery of your purchase within a fortnight
what was that thing about the spell
Did you say something about the spell
Mor'du Mor'du now the time has come for all of us to slaughter you
Hooray
Mor'du Mor'du
Merida
Mum
i have been worried sick
you
you were
i did not know where you'd gone or when you'd come back
i did not know what to think
Look at your dress
Angus threw me
but i am not hurt
Well you are home now so that is the end of it
Honestly
i have pacified the lords for now
Your father's out there entertaining them
Come taste my blade you manky bear
for gobbling up my leg
i will hunt you then i will skin you hang your noggin on a peg
of course we both know a decision still has to be made
what is this
it is a peace offering
i made it
for you
Special
you made this for me
Interesting flavor
how do you feel
what
what is that
Different
Tart and gamy
have you changed your mind at all about the marriage and all that
that is better
now why do not we go upstairs to the lords and put this whole kerfuffle to rest
Mother
i am woozy suddenly
my head's spinning like a top
Mum
Suddenly i am not so well
how do you feel about the marriage now
Merida
Just take me to my room
all right that is fine
that is just fine
a little to the left
that is good
a wee bit to the left
that is good
it is good enough
now clear out of there boys
i do not want you to spoil my shot
what
my lady Queen
we have been waiting patiently
Milords i am out of sorts at the moment
but you shall have your answer
Presently
now if you will excuse us
Elinor look
it is Mor'du
Elinor
are you all right dear
Fine
i am fine
Go about avenging your leg
Aye
you heard her lads
i dream about the perfect way to make this devil die
Just take all the time you need to getting yourself right Mum
then maybe in a bit you might have something new to say on the marriage
what was in that cake
Cake
Mum
so i will just tell them the wedding's off then
Mum
Bear
Mum
you are
you are a bear
Why a bear
that scaffy witch gave me a gammy spell
it is not my fault
i did not ask her to change you into a bear
i just wanted her to change you
Did you hear that
Something's not right
there is no point in having a go at me
the witch is to blame
Goggly old hag
Eyes all over the place
Unbelievable
i will get her to fix this
Why do i always get blamed for everything
it is just not fair
Everybody follow me
and keep a sharp eye
here we go
another hunt through the castle
but we haven't had dessert yet
i have no idea
Mum you can not go out there
Mum
Wait
what are you doing
Dad
the Bear King
if he so much as sees you you are dead
another one of your entertainments to bore us to death
and what exactly are we after
Mum my liege
Best to humor him
he is after all the King
he is like a hound with that nose of his
Mum wait
we have to
Follow me
Stop
Stop
you are covered with fur
you are not naked
it is not like anyone's gonna see you
now you have done it
Maudie
Just calm down lass

Spit it out Maudie
a bear
i knew it
would you just listen to me
we can not go this way
you will be seen
Quick

Mum
Mum
a witch turned Mum into a bear
it is not my fault
we have got to get out of the castle
i need your help
all right

Three weeks

Fine

Did you hear that
there it goes
Come on lads
there it goes
Come on Mum
Think we should lay a trap
Try shutting yours
there he is
i am sure it went this way
you can see my house from here
it must have sprouted wings
was carried away by a giant birdy
a dragon perhaps
Bear in the castle
Doesn't make sense
it cannot open doors
he is got big giant paws
Let's just get inside
it is locked
Dingwall was the last up
i propped it open with a stick
what did you see Maudie
Just spit it out Maudie
for goodness' sakes Maudie would you get a grip
Maudie honey come here
it is all right
Come on Mum
Quick
they will be fine
Won't you boys
Mum we have got to hurry
now i will be back soon
Go on and help yourself to anything you want as a reward
Right
where are these wisps
Come out wisps
Come on out
Lead me to the witch's cottage
i am here
Fine
do not come out now that my mum's watching
i was standing right here and the wisp appeared right there
then a whole trail of them led me off into the forest
does she think we are just going to happen upon the witch's cottage
Mum i know this place
the witch's cottage
it is this way
Come on
Hurry
i can not believe it
i found it
no
she was here
no really she was just here
Wait
no
no no
no
no

Good morning

what
Sorry
i do not speak bear
Find those by the creek did you
they are nightshade berries
they are poisonous
where did you get this water
it has worms
Come on
Breakfast
Wait
a princess should not have weapons in your opinion
there you go
Go on
how do you know you do not like it if you won't try it
Hey
where are you going
Mum come back
Mum is that you
Mum

Like you were a
i mean like you were a bear on the inside
a wisp
Mum
Stop it
Mum no
Mum
Jings crivens help ma boab
Mum i know you are scared you are tired you do not understand but we have got to keep our heads
Just calm down
Listen
they will show us the way
Mum look
Why did the wisps bring us here
Whoever they were they have been gone for a long long time
i am fine Mum
Just fine
it is a throne room
you suppose this could've been the kingdom in that story you were telling me
the one with the princes
one two three four
the oldest
Split like the tapestry
the spell
it is happened before
Strength of ten men
Fate be changed
Changed his fate
oh no
the prince became
Mor'du
Mum we need to get back to the castle
if we do not hurry you will become like Mor'du
a bear
a real bear
Forever
Mend the bond torn by pride
the witch gave us the answer
the tapestry
Mum do you have a better idea
that will do
no more talk
no more traditions
we settle this now
you are the King
you decide which one of our sons your daughter will marry
None of your sons are fit to marry my daughter
then our alliance is over
this means war
they are gonna murder each other
you have got to stop them before it is too late
i know i know
but how do we get you through there and up to the tapestry with the lot of them boiling over like that
what are you doing lass
it is all right Dad
i
i have
Well you see i
i have been in conference with the Queen
is that so
Aye it is
Well where is she then
she
how do we know that this is not some trick
I'd never
this is highly irregular
what are you playing at
where is the Queen
we will not stand for any more of this jiggery pokery
that is right
Let's see her
Shut it
Well i
Once there was an ancient kingdom
what is this
that kingdom fell into war and chaos and ruin
we have all heard that tale
Lost kingdom
Aye but it is true
i know now how one selfish act can turn the fate of a kingdom
it is just a legend
Legends are lessons
they ring with truths
our kingdom is young
our stories are not yet legend
but in them our bond was struck
our clans were once enemies
but when invaders threatened us from the sea you joined together to defend our lands
you fought for each other
you risked everything for each other
Lord MacGuffin my dad saved your life stopping an arrow as you ran to Dingwall's aid
Aye and i will never forget it
and Lord Macintosh you saved my dad when you charged in on heavy horse and held off the advance
and we all know how Lord Dingwall broke the enemy line
with a mighty throw of his spear
i was aiming at you you big tumshie
the story of this kingdom is a powerful one
my dad rallied your forces and you made him your king
it was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship and it lives to this day
but i have been selfish
i tore a great rift in our kingdom
there is no one to blame but me
and i know now that i need to amend my mistake and mend our bond
and so there is the matter of my betrothal
i have decided to do what is right and and and break tradition
my mother the Queen feels in her heart that i that we be free to write our own story follow our hearts and find love in our own time
that is beautiful
the Queen and i put the decision to you my lords
might our young people decide for themselves who they will love
Well since you have obviously made up your minds about this
i have one thing to say
this is
a grand idea
Give us our own say in choosing our fate
what
Aye
Why should not we choose
but she is the princess
i did not pick her out
it was your idea
and you
you feel the same way
Good
Well that settles it
Let these lads try and win her heart before they win her hand
if they can
i say the wee Dingwall has a fighting chance
Fine then
Seems for once we agree
it was my idea in the first place
Just like your mum
you devil
everyone to the cellar
Let's crack open the King's private reserve to celebrate
Whoa whoa whoa
Bring the tiny glasses
oh the tapestry
Mend the bond
Mend the bond
Stitch it up

Kelvin Moore
he was an accountant with Pineridge Financial
Grew up in the building
he and his wife Elaine were here visiting her sister Alicia in 6F
the presents were for Alicia's daughter
Kelvin's wife give us anything
she is still in shock
Paramedics are trying to calm her down
Kids playing dice in the street got a look at the shooter but the best they could do was male medium build ski mask hoodie
Hmm
no wallet
her wallet's gone too
Busy building lobby middle of the day
Pretty brazen
or pretty desperate
everyone i speak with around here talks about Kelvin like he was a saint
then let's make sure we find the sinner
 Out here in the fields   i fight for my meals   i get my back into my living   yeah yeah yeah yeah  sync and corrections by bellows www addic7ed com
do you know what day it is tomorrow
yes and you do not need to be thinking about that right now
i can not help it
Tomorrow Lucy's gonna be opening her presents with that ridiculously cute smile on her ridiculously cute face
i will be thinking about this
uh get lost
i got this
no it is fine
i have seen a lot worse
i am good
and i am great but it is you know it is a little cramped in here and i can not do three things at once and you know Danny's got the street and the shooter's escape route
so somebody needs to go talk to the wife
you
Go
Thanks
 do not look ahead there is stormy weather   oh oh oh   another roadblock in our way   oh oh oh oh   but if we go we go together   oh oh oh   our hands are tied here if we stay   oh we said our dreams will carry us   and if they do not fly we will run   now we push right past to find out   how to win what they all lost   oh ah oh ah   we know now we want more   oh ah oh ah   a life worth fighting for   oh ah oh ah   a life worth fighting for   oh ah oh ah   we know that we want more   oh ah oh ah   a life worth fighting for   Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah   a oh   a oh   Ah ah ah ah ah ah   a oh 
the door opened behind us and the guy walked in
he was black
he was he was wearing a ski mask
do you remember anything strange about him at all
his eyes or his teeth or the way that he walked or talked
i remember the gun
it was silver and shiny
he said
Wallets
all your jewelry
we will give you whatever you want
Shut up
okay
Relax man
Take it easy
Shut up
Hurry up with the jewelry
Bitch
i said hurry
do not
oh
oh my God
no
no
if i just could have gotten the bracelet unclasped faster
do not do that to yourself Elaine
it is not your fault
we moved away from here after we got married and he landed the job at the firm
Kelvin was never afraid of living on this block
he was afraid of dying here
my sister and Kelvin were so happy together best friends
they grew up in this building together
they met when they were in the first grade
Started dating when they were seniors in high school
Thank you
Whoever did this ain't from around here
Clyde
Clyde Duvall
Clyde lives next door
he is like a big brother to me
Kelvin had a way about him
Even the punks on the corner respected him
he never forgot where he came from either
he fixed up the playgrounds and the basketball courts with his own money
so it was not a secret around here that Kelvin and Elaine were doing all right for themselves
Folks knew he was a big shot accountant with a Manhattan condo and a fancy car if that is what you mean
who else would have known that Kelvin and Elaine were coming here to visit today
Just me
you know it was a last minute thing
Unless Elaine and Kelvin told somebody
i just
i just can not believe that he is dead
you know he was such a special man
Everybody loved him
not everybody
what do you got for me Sid
if i had a nickel for every time i heard that question
i am afraid i have spoiled everyone around here over the years
the age old tradition of the investigator being present at autopsy is to answer questions that might assist the medical examiner moi in determining the cause and mode of death not the other way around
Well that is what the book says but
i do not think they knew about Sid Hammerback when they wrote it
you always have more answers than questions
that is why you are the best
Flattery will get you everywhere
some type of oil based substance
COD is clear cut
Fatal through and through entering the lower left side of the chest and exiting at the upper right scapula traversing the torso at an upward angle causing massive damage to internal organs
here is what concerns me
Lindsay's DD5 complaint report has the shooter and the victim face to face at close quarters struggling over the gun
Elaine Moore says the gun discharged while pressed into her husband's chest
that is right
Take a look at the entrance wound
no stellate tearing or burns
Definitely not close contact
and based on the caliber of gun type of ammo and the GSR pattern on the clothing
i am saying the shot was fired from five to seven feet away
Elaine Moore's story doesn't fit the evidence
we know the science doesn't lie and people do
a shot from five to seven feet away is a lot different than a close contact wound
Maybe Elaine was too shaken up and she is just filling in the blanks
but we can not talk to her again until we have more evidence to go at her with
so the money clip on the wallet turned out to be money i got a print
that was completely submerged in a puddle
not long enough for the lipids and oils to wash away
i used a small particle reagent process to pull a useable print
Morris Davis
been arrested a bunch of times but more importantly
lives next door to the building where Kelvin was killed
Let's pay him a visit  i am sing selling diamonds have a risk   a biopsy might show you what the weapon is   Remove my brain to buy my
she was fat as hell
Morris Davis
oh i thought for sure we were gonna be doing some running
that is nice
Ain't got no reason to run
all right
the man who was killed here earlier today might be a good reason
i ain't have nothing to do with that
Nah i think i think you did have something to do with it
i found your prints on his wallet
i found that wallet
oh come on son
you can do better than that
no no no i found the wallet and i swear i i took the money but i never looked inside
Ain't know that wallet belonged to Mr Kelvin
Yo watch where you going
Did you get a good look at the guy who bumped you
Nah he was a brother though tall with his hoodie pulled down tight
Yo i ain't got no use for this money if it belonged to Mr Kelvin
it is mostly all there
Y'all can lock me up if you want
the way i see it you are turning in the money
how well did you know Mr Kelvin
Everybody knew him till he moved out a couple years ago
he was like the nicest dude on the block
Always playing hoops breaking up fights telling the kids to stay in school
Tried to tell me but i guess i was too headstrong to listen
Well if you liked Mr Kelvin as much as you say you did maybe you will give me a call if you hear any names floating around the street
i will keep my ears open for real
Well we got a kid here who is trying to do the right thing
you buying his story
Well makes sense
what doesn't make sense is a stickup man dumping the wallet he just killed for with cash and credit cards still inside
Hey guys that granular substance
i found on the vestibule floor turned out to be a cheap mix of porcelain
i am not sure how long it is been there or if it has anything to do with our crime
Great
Sounds promising
now the note paper i found on the vestibule floor is very promising
it took me a while to figure it out but it is a New York State inmate i D number
so what is your theory
that the killer jotted down his inmate number and left it behind at the scene of the murder
Wow it is a tough crowd today
will you give me a second
my theory is
i do not have a theory but this guy sure looks good as a suspect
Willis Frazier
Career criminal just released on parole after serving a five year stretch for armed robbery with a gun
yeah he grew up on that block and how is this for a coincidence he missed his scheduled visit with his parole officer this morning around the same time Kelvin was being robbed and murdered
so what are the chances that parole's gonna issue a warrant
Pretty promising
here is your ticket to the dance
Flack is your date
he is meeting you there
Hands
Let me see your hands now
you too
Hands
Hands
Get up
so tell me about your relationship with Willis Frazier
there is nothing to tell
no
you were pen pals when he was in prison
you sent him two letters a week
you put money in his commissary account every month
we used to date
Simple as that
it is not so simple though
you were at his apartment hours after your husband was murdered
he was comforting me
Really
all the people in your life you turn to your ex con ex boyfriend for comfort
you were having an affair Elaine
this is Willis' inmate i D number
we found it in the vestibule where your husband was killed
that was in my bag
it must have fallen out when the guy who killed him took my wallet
you know what i think Elaine
i think you are playing me
i think the tears and the grief they are all an act
i think you had Willis kill your husband
oh my
Armed robbery assault possession with intent
all before your 21st birthday
i paid my debt
Well i want to believe you Willis but my only hesitation is this murder thing
Aw so you gonna think whatever you gonna think
you are a hard man i can see that
Nobody messes with you or takes what is yours
like Kelvin when he married Elaine
i was on the inside and Elaine was on the outside
she moved on
i never blamed Kelvin for that
you mean to tell me all those years in prison knowing Kelvin had the woman you wanted and was living a life you could only dream about you never felt jealous
Willis
Willis and i had something Kelvin could not give me passion
so the man you wted was sent away and you settled for Kelvin
do not say it like that
i did not settle for him
he was the most caring and loving man that i ever knew
i loved him
you just loved Willis more but i can not hide it either
Elaine was made for me
so when i got out we picked up where we left off
Only one problem though
Kelvin
i would not kill Kelvin
he never did nothing to me
you expect me to take you at your word
you missed your parole visit the very morning your girlfriend's husband was shot to death
i work nights
i overslept
oh honey you have got to do a lot better than that
i do not have an alibi but all i can say is that
Kelvin Moore was a good man
he treated Elaine like gold while i was away
i would have never laid a finger on him and that is the God's truth
we have a serious problem here Elaine
and what is that
Your version of what happened this morning
you said that when the suspect came in you and Kelvin were standing at the buzzer that he demanded your wallets and your jewelry and that he pistol whipped you when you were too slow
that is not what happened
that is what happened
i could not get the clasp on my bracelet undone
the guy was getting anxious Kelvin tried to rush him
no
he just shot him
here is the thing Elaine if the gun had been held up against your husband's shirt there would have been burn marks on the entry wound and on his shirt
there weren't any
there would have been a distinct gunshot residue pattern but the GSR pattern on your husband's shirt would indicate that he was shot from a distance
the gun was at least five feet away
Also the bullet that killed your husband was travelling at an upward trajectory
you know what that means
it means that it entered your husband at a low angle and it exited at a high angle so either the shooter was extremely short which we know he was not or he was on the ground
so i do not remember every detail
my husband was murdered right in front of me
you got the placement of the gun wrong you got the distance of the shooter wrong
you are lying Elaine
i need to know why
Elaine had no explanation for the inconsistencies in her story
no and when i started to press her she shut down so i had to cut her loose
Willis was the same
Parole won't hold him until we have something more
i look at Elaine and i do not see a murderer
Even now
there is gotta be a piece missing
Well the missing piece is the third person in that
and Willis had motive means and the track record of violence
yeah so now we just need to find the evidence
Maybe i can help
i just processed the dark smudge they found on our victim
Turns out to be mostly axle grease
Pretty common but i did find traces of naptha kerosene and corrosion inhibitors
Jet fuel
Jet Fuel B to be precise
Kelvin had no reason to come in contact with Jet Fuel B
so what was it doing on his hand
Hey there
Hey i am having a crisis of conviction in the middle of a toy store
okay
my head says pick the developmentally stimulating blocks made from organic recycled wood but my heart says princess doll
Well i am sure whatever you pick
Lucy's gonna love
oh you have obviously never disappointed a three year old
i always say go with your gut
oh or we could go with ponies
should i send a squad car to rescue you
Well what is everybody else bringing
Wait a minute
this is not about Lucy is it
of course not
this is about meeting your friends for the first time and that is a lot of pressure
if they see in you even a fraction of what i see you will be a hit
you are a sweet man Mac Taylor
Go solve crime
Hey
i opened up Elaine Moore had at the crime scene each one had identical wrapping paper
Same as the wrapping paper that i found out in the street
the suspect tracked it out of the vestibule
Except none of the wrapping paper on these presents was torn
Piece of paper Danny found did not come from one of these packages
Check this out
what do you see
a void in the blood spatter
that looks like the edge of a box
None of the packages had blood spatter matching the void
so there was another package at the crime scene
something the suspect took that
Elaine neglected to tell us
Whatever it was
looks like Kelvin Moore was murdered for it
Police
Open up
you got a warrant
we can get one
or you could ask nice
may we come in
where is Elaine
i do not know
Try her apartment
we have
then we tried her work and now we are here
Well she is not
Well when was the last time you saw her
last night when we left the precinct
you haven't spoken to her on the phone
i called a few times but she is not answering
are not you worried
i am
Did you call the police
i am not too fond of police
Look Willis if you care about Elaine you got to tell us what is going on
we can help you
Elaine has been acting strange since before Kelvin was killed
she was making whispered phone calls she did not want to tell me about
i do not want to get her in any trouble
she is suspected of having her husband killed
there is not much more trouble she can be in
Elaine did not kill Kelvin and neither did i
but she lied to us about how Kelvin was murdered
when people lie they usually have something to hide
we think Kelvin's murder was connected to one of the packages
Elaine had on her
you know anything about that
the gifts she had for her niece
yeah
Elaine was here when i got off the night shift but not to see me
she had those gifts with her'cause she wrapped'em here but she did not say why
then she left
a few hours later Kelvin was dead
and i found this
Hawkes found traces of porcelain at the crime scene
so what is that mean
 and we finally awake   and walk into the sunny day 
 Enemy throws all my money away   Enemy knows how to make me always pay   i always pay   Enemy lies do not cross my mind   Enemy talks talking so nice and kind   so nice and kind 
you ever heard of a Maneki Neko
it means beckoning cat
it is supposed to bring good luck to shop owners
who display it
Sure i have seen'em
they are supposed to have their paw up
this one's just lying there
i know but the coloring and design details resemble that of Maneki Nekos
Also there is some type of Japanese calligraphy on its base
what is that telling us
nothing yet but i did confirm that the porcelain matches the trace that we found on the vestibule floor where Kelvin was killed
you know all the other gifts that Elaine had were toys for her niece
this statue doesn't fit
Well i am not so sure the statue is as important as what was inside
i found white powder on several pieces
Came back as cocaine
oh wow okay the statue's hollow
large enough to hide a significant amount of illegal narcotics
I'd say about two kilos
yeah and they were sealed inside so Elaine had to smash it open to remove the drugs
then Elaine wrapped the drugs to match the gifts for her niece took them to Alicia's
but why
Suggests both Elaine and Alicia are involved in some kind of drug ring
Maybe Kelvin too
it is crazy Mac neither Kelvin or Elaine have any kind of a criminal history let alone drug dealing
what is Alicia's background
she is a single mom with two jobs
she is not exactly Tony Montana
Well it is what the evidence points to
this murder was about drugs
yeah well i just talked to my buddy in Narcotics
he said he doesn't know anything about moving coke inside cat statues but he mentioned Maximo and Liebert Webster okay two mid level drug dealers
so what is their connection to Elaine and Kelvin
Narcotics got a tip from a CI who was inside the Webster brothers' apartment
he said he saw a stash of two kilos of coke so he executed a warrant a few hours later comes up dry
Nobody gets locked up
two kilos is the same amount
Elaine may have gotten out of the statue
yes and the warrant was for the apartment right across from Alicia's
two days before Kelvin was killed
Alicia it is Detective Flack
Open up
NYPD
Open up
they are not here
who is not here
Alicia or the Websters
None of them
those punks cleared out a day after the raid
what do you know about them
they are dangerous
they have been dealing out of that apartment for months
other than that
what about Alicia
she have any contact with them
there is two kind of people in this building
People like them
yeah scumbags
and people like me and Alicia
we work hard we mind our business and we try not to get caught in the cross fire
you said Alicia's not around
you happen to know where she is
uh uh
it was earlier
i did hear her and the kid rush out to catch the bus
she always comes back after she sees her off
she did not come back today though
Haven't seen either of them since
Yo
Hey
i have been trying to translate the symbols on the bottom of the statue figure out if we can trace the origin of the drugs
do you know how many variations of Japanese calligraphy there are
Four Grasshopper
Dozens okay
i spent hours searching through Japanese symbols then Chinese then Korean
could not find a match to the bottom of the statue
oh so a dead end
no breakthrough
this symbol it doesn't mean anything
it is not a Chinese character or Japanese or Korean
it is a company logo
Good Luck Ceramics
yeah supplies novelty stores in the tristate area with all kinds of Asian themed pottery
this one's their knockoff of a Maneki Neko
they call it the Lucky Bobcat
is it a top seller
no they are not exactly flying off the shelves except at Haiku Novelties in Chelsea
they have ordered four cases every month for a year
Nobody needs that much luck
okay
yes everything is going to be fine
okay
this is going to be over soon
all right
Just go home
Go
Run
Go
do not move
Stop
Alicia
Stop
oh
oh my God
Let me go
Get up
Get up Alicia
Get up
Alicia get up
no
i need to go
they have my child
what
the men the men across the hall
they said that if i did not give them the drugs they'd kill my daughter
be advised we have a possible kidnapping victim and hostage situation at this location
that is our friend Old Man Winter
oh
but i am just afraid that you might melt or something
is winter good
NYPD
Police
Come here
Come here
Get down
do not move
do not move
okay you are all right
there is a gun on the couch
Gun on the couch
i haven't had an easy life
Detective i have been raising my daughter on my own and she needs me
Whether you go to jail or not depends largely on what you say to me in this room
this is your chance to tell the truth Alicia
i do not have anything to hide anymore
the most important thing i need to know is who shot Kelvin
i do not know
Why do not you start by telling me why Kelvin and Elaine were bringing you two kilos of cocaine
Kelvin did not know about the drugs
Elaine was bringing me the package
it was three days ago
i was home with my daughter can we invite like a couple of friends of something
yeah you can
I'd say three friends
Just five
Michelle go to your room
These men were banging on the door
Open the door man
Hey open it or we kick it in
what do you want
what do you want
Shh
Hurry up man
they gave me the drugs they told me to hold the drugs
now we gonna be back when the cops are gone
you talk you die you hear me
Let's go
the girl first
then you
Michelle close the door
and then more banging on the door
i look it is the police
uh just a second
i was scared you know i
i dumped'em
Dumped it
and i opened the door and the police they were telling me they wanted me to move to the back of the apartment in case there was gunplay
i was scared you know
i did not know what would happen if they found me with the drugs
they would've protected you
i did not have time to think you know i was afraid
i have to live in that apartment building
those those men they have people
i understand
what happened when they came back for the drugs
Hey tell me hmm
Why i should not kill you right now
i am going to get you the money i swear to God
Leave my daughter alone
i want the coke
Please do not hurt her
two keys is what i gave you
that is what i want back
Tomorrow
or you watch your kid die
i did not deserve this
i am a really good person
if you are telling me the truth there is not a D a in the city that will prosecute you
Elaine had the money who had the connection for the drugs
this guy i grew up with Deron people call him D
he is been out of the business for awhile but he knew a guy on Canal who is been dealing weight for years
so did D know anything about when and how you were coming to the building to deliver the package to Alicia
no
he gave me the number he told me to drop his name he did not want to know anything
he is got a family now a job
what about the guy at the shop
or what about your boyfriend Willis
the guy in the shop barely spoke English
i gave him the money he gave me the statue
Willis had no idea what we were doing
you know he is just out of prison
he is on parole
i could not take a chance on him getting caught up in this
all right so then i need you to tell me exactly what happened in the vestibule
the truth Elaine
Really
they might've said something
Wallets
all your jewelry
we will give you whatever you want
Shut up
oh
Hey
Relax
Relax
do not move
Take it easy
where is it
where is it
where is it
where is it
where is what
what are you talking about
what is he talking about
where is what
Move
what is going on Elaine
what is he talking about
no no no
no
no baby baby
Baby look at me
are you okay
Baby
Baby
Stay with me
no no baby baby
so Kelvin is dead and the drugs are gone
it is just hard for me to imagine why at that point you and Alicia did not come to the police
we were scared
we did not know what to do
we were gonna go to the precinct this afternoon when Michelle got off the bus from school
she never made it
those men they called me they told me
you will never see her alive again unless i bring the drugs to the motel
i need to think Alicia
because somebody knew what was in that package and they knew exactly when it was gonna be delivered
how about Clyde
no i ha hadn't even seen Clyde in days
Think then who
who could it have been
Nobody
Nobody else knew
i swear
we have the how and the why now we just need the who
they either told someone or someone heard the conversation they had
Alicia said they spoke over her cell and she was alone in the apartment
yeah Elaine said the same thing
what are you thinking
the answer is in Alicia's apartment
Alicia tell us exactly where you were standing when you were on the phone with Elaine telling her to bring the drugs to the building
i was here looking out the window
were you leaning against the wall
Mm yes
i watch my daughter get off the school bus every afternoon
i mean
i do not understand what difference does it make where i was standing
i do not know what you are trying to do here but i want you out of my apartment now
you killed him Clyde
you killed Kelvin Moore
i did not kill nobody
you heard Alicia leave this morning just like you heard her on the phone with Elaine telling her about the trouble she was in
you heard all of it through this wall
you knew the drugs were coming into the building you knew how when and where
you waited for them
you know you are lying
i am not
two kilos that is like 40 grand cash walking through the door
but that was not enough
you wanted Kelvin's wallet
when you grabbed it from his hand you left something behind Jet Fuel B
the same fuel you used to pump into those jetliners before you lost your job with the airline a couple of months ago
i am guessing the gloves you wore during the robbery were the same ones you used to wear to work
and i bet they are somewhere in this apartment along with that gun
where you think that gun is now Clyde
Turn around
there are two kind opeople in this place Clyde people like Kelvin Moore and scumbags like you
Let's go
Clyde saw that package coming into the building as money so he decided to take it without any regard for what would happen to you and your family
Mommy
oh God
Honey
are you okay
Mm hmm
oh my God
are you sure
oh God
are you okay
Look i know you must think i am a horrible person for cheating on my husband
i loved Kelvin
Just not the way everyone wanted me to
i do not think you are a horrible person
i just think it is sad that you did not realize that the greatest gift you had walking into that building yesterday was standing right next to you
 
Hey
Hey
Hey
what do you got there
is that the uh Mac Taylor action figure
Sold out
i went with old reliable a little teddy bear
Speaking of old reliable teddy bears
Mac Taylor

i hope uh horses blocks and princess dolls are okay
oh Mac will have a blast with those
Mac will have a blast with what
inside joke
when you have been part of the group for a little while longer we will let you in on it
oh uh Adam can you hold that for a second
we will be right behind you
what was that for
' Cause i felt like it
' Cause you made me feel like it
and letting me into your world the way you have has just changed my life
i can not stop smiling
i can not stop thinking about you
for a long time this place and those guys have been my whole world
they have helped me through some tough times
now i have you
sync and corrections by bellows www addic7ed comthis is court ordered mediation
it is not opt out mediation or i do not feel like it mediation
we know that but what can we do
we can not negotiate with a stone
yes but you can lower your ask
Given the set of facts i am looking at well it is way too high
and the law is far from clear as to
then let's go to court
Look the judge doesn't want to clutter up his docket
that is why he empowered me to keep you here as long as i want to reach a compromise
and i will
so show me some movement
our client wanted to sue for 38 million in punitive
we got her down to 14
that is movement
but where is theirs
Think about a new ask
i need you to raise your offer
oh come on
Given the set of facts i am looking at well it is way too low
and the legal issues
what about their ask 12 million for what was clearly an accident 14 million
oh my God
it keeps going up
no it was always 14 million
Exactly because they won't move
that is will Gardner's M O
he gets his opposition negotiating with themselves so he can just sit back and
okay the good news is they have agreed to an increase in their offer
Really
yes 100 000
as a goodwill gesture
but it is linked to an equivalent reduction in your ask
we are not meeting in the middle
you are meeting in the middle
Everyone's meeting in the middle or i keep you here
this was an unfortunate accident
Wait a minute
i know Celeste works under the mistaken impression that if she says something enough times it will make it true but this was not an accident this was fraud
Deposition 101 page 58
but was not this an accident ma'am Answer
no an accident is unintentional
what your client did to me was intentional
you sound angry ma'am
do i
i guess i am
i
WlLL
would you like to take a break Maggie
can we get you anything for your pain
CELESTE
Thank you Mr Gardner
Why do not we let Maggie raise her hand when she wants to take a break instead of continually vocalizing her pain into the record
Wow Celeste
Cynical much
Only since your fifth interruption
Thank you but i do not need a break
she doesn't need a break will
can i continue now
WlLL
it is up to you
CELESTE
this was all caused by an accident four years ago was not it
i was in a car accident
it caused DDD degenerative disc disorder
it is misaligned vertebrae discs
and Dr Farland the man you are suing my client suggested an operation
he did
he said i needed an SCS a spinal cord stimulator
a device like this
our client was given a chance to choose which model to have surgically implanted from a catalogue of 12 FDA approved models
but she did not choose any that is the defense's point
yes but i expected him to pick one of the FDA approved devices
i was never told there was another option
and what happened after the operation Maggie
the pain was gone
i was ready to worship
Dr Farland
ALlCIA
but then the pain came back
yes it was like a deal with the Devil
it came back three times worse
but that is not why you brought suit
no
about a month after my operation i received an itemized bill for the SCS
on it was listed the manufacturer and the inventor
and who was the inventor
my doctor Dr Farland
and this device he invented it was not FDA approved
that is right
he just implanted it in me like i was a guinea pig
MEDlATOR
i want to sympathize
i do but you can not keep asking for 14 million
ALlCIA
Maggie has three children
she is in constant pain
her life has been shortened by a decade
her husband left her and she is being kicked out of her house all because she cannot hold down a job or offer spousal companionship
now if that happened to me from a doctor who experimented on me without my knowledge
i am sorry but i would be asking for twice as much
Good job
Keep on him
and everyone the mediator's threatening to keep us here through the weekend and i think he means it so make arrangements
cell phone beeping
we might have a slight edge in mediation
the mediator seems sympathetic
Really
will that matter
not really
we are heading to trial either way but it shows our argument's working
what is up there
i just got a call
someone who needs crisis management
one of our clients
no someone impressed with the Florrick rehabilitation
chuckling
oh wow
now i am starting to feel like a slacker
Eli is starting to clock more billable hours than us
who is it one of the airlines
i heard a jet went off the runway at O'Hare
no but i might be able to sign them
i can decide for both of us
yes
Just keep me in the loop
Mm hmm
Cheese
Cheese
yes
we represent the Wisconsin State Dairy Guild and we need your help
with cheese
yes
a certain kind of cheese or all cheese
there was an outbreak of listeriosis in a Chicago grammar school four hours ago
News reports say the outbreak was traced to bacterial infected cheese slices
Five children are hospitalized four teachers are ill and we are getting alarmed calls from government officials
Patrick
Lydia
does the guild have a contract with an existing PR firm
Keyser Associates
they are working on an Eat Cheese campaign
not anymore
you hire me i am one voice
Tell me that is ok we are going forward
i will have to get permission
that is fine for now but i need someone here who doesn't need to get permission
Agnes hello
Get get me
Monthly retainer of 60 000 a month
Hourly still applies
you will find that is competitive
Fine
Get me everything on listeriosis anyone who will speak out against cheese
and i will need more investigator time
Get Kalinda
she is on the mediation
not anymore
Mm hmm
60 60 a month
W wait hold on
NEWSCASTER may also be tainted
it was just after recess
the culprit the most innocent of foods
Cheese
this cell phone video oh dear God
Shot by a cafeteria worker captures several students becoming gravely ill
we are worried this is gonna keep people from purchasing cheese
you think
Cheeseburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches
ELl
you will have to hire Lockhart Gardner as temporary counsel
Actually we have outside counsel
okay i can explain myself for now but when things move faster you are going to have to just trust me
Currently everything we say and do can be subpoenaed for civil or criminal trial
and believe me with news like this you do not want that
we need to be able to speak under cover of attorney client privilege which Diane provides and we need it now
newscast continues indistinctly
Go ahead get permission
hi Walter
Still there
we also need to hire Lockhart Gardner as temporary counsel
NEWSCASTER as we learn more
and get me the CEO of Heather Farms before he talks to a reporter
here he comes now
you just tell him what you told me
what is wrong
is everything all right
i do not know
i got a call from someone at the Vindicator
she asked if i had an opinion about the results of the medical investigation of Dr Farland
the
i do not understand
it is a year off
i know
she said the FDA expedited it
she got an early look and they are siding with Dr Farland
ALlCIA
it may not be true
it doesn't matter
any rumor of an investigation that goes against us hurts us
Did this reporter say when she wanted a comment
this afternoon
she has to go to press Monday with the leak
here is her number
she is the Metro editor
Kate Hanson i know her
Let me give her a call
she will be easy to stall
Thank you for doing this
cooing
Once more around the park
baby fussing engine starting
so what do you think
i think we have a gun to our head and can not wait for trial
we have to get a good deal in mediation
Damn
be right there
Owen can you do me a favor
Diane we
i will call you back
i think the mediator's lying to us
i think you are right
two hours and a bottle of wine we can settle this
Just this
Why not the Middle East
it is game theory with imperfect information will
Why do not we make it perfect
i thought you liked imperfect
Poker over chess
you sure you are on the right floor
i am serious
we used to settle a lot of things in the old days
we used to unsettle a lot of things too
i am going into my room now

Gretchen Battista

Gardner
yeah so you will be getting a package in about an hour or so Ms Battista
Just ignore it
oh i already got it
my parents drink Scotch
they will be really grateful
and what might you need
you contacted my client for comment on the FDA investigation
i thought i might help
you would not happen to be fishing for what i might know would you Mr Gardner
i might be
i just find it odd that you'd be the only reporter leaked an FDA decision
Maybe i am just a better reporter
and maybe you have a source that is lying and trying to undermine this negotiation
so come in for an interview and you can offer some context
okay
how about lunch on Monday
oh you mean after my deadline
oh i do not think so
how about in my office in one hour
two hours
phone beeps
i thought we had agreed this morning to lower your ask by 100 000
yes and we reevaluated our position and we are staying with our original ask
laughs
i am glad you think it is funny
i thought we were making progress
oh we are making progress
Mr Gardner has a tell
when he is in trouble he doubles down
so we are lowering our offer
you do not you think the issues here are too serious to treat like gambling
no gambling is too serious to treat like these issues
we are lowering our offer
elevator bell dings
you all right
no
okay
cell phone ringing
yeah
what are you doing
will wants me to get some inkling of their bottom line in mediation
Why
Eli needs your help
Heather Farms outside Bloomington
the USDA is investigating this listeria outbreak and they tend to be slow
Well which takes priority cheese or mediation
both
all right got it
ALlCIA
i expect mediation to extend through the weekend at least so um i will be
there is no Heather Farms
it is just one division of Karpwell Foods
ELl
and i do not care
i am not your rabbi sir
i am merely trying to keep your cheese from damaging the image of all cheeses
Well i am sorry you feel that way but i do care
it is not even clear that we are responsible
i mean what else did these kids eat
that is what i want to know
oh yes that is a great line of defense
with images like these people love to hear that the kids are really the problem
do you know who Tony Hayward is
do i
yes he is the CEO of British Petroleum
no ex CEO of BP
the man who many think oversaw the destruction of a brand
so first thing's first we work on your attitude
Excuse me
i think we need to work on
Look i do not have time to argue with you
the first rule of managing a crisis the top man answers the questions
that is the only reason you are here that is the only reason i am talking to you
so in ten minutes time you are giving a press conference where you will order all your cheese products off the shelves
we need a split screen of that image with you looking strong wrong tie get him a red tie then you will apologize for any missteps and say the buck stops here
Actually he can not do that
Actually he can and he will
no legally he is in a very vulnerable spot
he can not be out there apologizing and taking blame
he is gonna get sued no matter what
yes but the size of the suit is still in question
i do not care about the size of the suit Diane
yes Eli but i do
i will just sit here then
Diane you are only here as window dressing
you are only here to keep us from getting subpoenaed
no i am here as their lawyer
you are working the images
and the images take precedent right now
Eli listen to me
he won't have a business unless he
Nice to meet you Mr Protopapas
Dr Farland was stopping by for lunch
but if you have any questions
Ms Serrano could i speak with you
this is really inappropriate
we were having lunch
it is been on the books for weeks
i am not listening to any evidence off the record ma'am
and i am not offering any
i am standing on the record
so is the plaintiff
and they offer a convincing case
an easily refuted case
Mrs Reeves is responsible for her own condition
how do you figure
Deposition 200 page 14
it is so key i know it from memory
Question
if there is nothing wrong with your device Doctor how did it malfunction
it did not malfunction
Even the best SCSs are prone to lead migration
CELESTE
and a lead is
oh sorry
when the electrical leads do not stay where intended
it is usually not serious but in the case of Maggie it became quite serious because the problem went undetected for so long
that is what caused the infection which caused the permanent damage to her spine
and why did it go undetected
Well i prescribed hydromorphone for any topical pain from the surgery but Mrs Reeves i am sorry to say this but she continued to use the painkiller long afterward
CELESTE
so if Mrs Reeves hadn't overmedicated herself she would have noticed the infection and come to you for her SCS adjustment
yes
i am sorry Mrs Reeves but it is true
WlLL
oh come on
Why not blame the victim for having pain in the first place
yes but is it true
the device malfunctioned the pain returned
Only then did Maggie take the painkillers
Celeste reverses it so she can make it seem like the painkillers caused the problem
if i can get her up to eight million will you say yes
is she offering eight million
will you accept it
if you are asking for our bottom line then no
we can not give you our bottom line or they will use it against us
phone chimes where is Kalinda
i thought she was looking into their bottom line
i will call
where are you going
to meet a reporter
REPORTER
Tonight school officials are reassuring parents that all cheese has been removed from the school lunch menu for the time being

Dad slept with somebody else
Dad
he slept with someone other than the hooker
he
how do we know
he told me
that is why Mom kicked him out
you did not know that
i did not know that
KALlNDA
what are they saying
MAN
they think it was an improper cleaning of the culture vats in Line Six
you sound like you do not agree
Well i clean Line Six with peroxyacetic acid and quaternary ammonium after every culture
they are not gonna find listeria there
where else could listeria come from
we keep these units accurate to one degree either way
i do not think it was a refrigeration problem
so what do you think
i think it used to be an easy job to find the source
now you got some of these cheeses they are a blend of three or four lines from three or four companies
so all i can say is good luck
Damn
are you sure
KALlNDA
uh Eli you know this is a good thing right
it looks like your client is not responsible for the listeria
Kalinda this is not the law
i am not looking for innocence i am looking for certainty
the whole point is to bury this story with an apology then move on
so you want our guy to be guilty
no i want it to be over
i do not want to train another CEO from some other company tomorrow to take the blame
DlANE
he can not say this
he has to say it
no he can say i offer my deepest sincerest sympathies to the families
and i am doing everything i can to trace the source of our missteps
no
the source of the outbreak
Really
Really Diane
he can not say anything that sounds like an admission
Really
i am doing everything i can to trace the source of the outbreak
Heather Farms is committed to finding the root of this
so why should i hold your story
WlLL
Well the Scotch for one
and because it is not true
it is not true that Dr Farland's being investigated
no it is not true the investigation is going Farland's way
and you know this how
i know this because i can see who has an agenda
in this case the defense
MAN
Heads up
Why should i care
because i can make you care
okay
i will give you complete back channel on the case
chuckles
uh as pulse racing as that is get me back channel on this
Your computer
Mm no the cheese thing
i have no idea what you are talking about
the listeria outbreak
all the sick kids some were hospitalized
Eli Gold is part of your firm right
i will delay my story you get me the back channel ticktock on the crisis managing
i will have to talk to Eli
Well then it would not be a back channel would it
Get me something behind the scenes
Let me see what i can do
oh and by the way uh it is not the FDA investigation that is concluding
what do you mean
the call i got was about the State's Attorney
Turns out they decided not to bring fraud charges against Dr Farland
hello
may i help you
you may
i need information about a fraud investigation
are you sure
Am i sure i have nothing to offer you about our fraud investigation
i am
we just need to know if this leak to Gretchen Battista was faked Cary that is all
and if it was then we need to get her to hold her story
i understand
i still have nothing
how have you been
oh come on
Kalinda you can fake somebody else but you can not fake me
what am i faking
Interest concern friendship
and what if i am not
then let's be friends
sighs
but i still do not have anything for you about this fraud investigation
Check with Matan it is his case
Hmm he is no use
because he doesn't want to sleep with you
but you do
i am merely making an observation
and what observation might that be
you tend to use people's feelings to further your investigations
you think that is what i did with you
i think i have to get back to work
Cary whatever i felt i did not invent
that is great to know Kalinda
now i have to get back to work and i think you do too
yeah
NEWSCASTER
the CEO questioned the need to recall all cheese products suggesting that the listeria victims themselves could have been responsible for the sickness
i do not know that much about it at this point but i i would love to know what else those kids were eating because i do not think it is just the cheese
Excuse me
Look i think it is a little premature at this point
what the hell
what the hell
what did you say
what did you say
what are you talking about
i i said exactly what you told me
i do not know enough but what else did these kids eat
you know what you do when you do not know enough
you shut the hell up
i did not say that
with a garbage bag in your hand
what are you Chico and the Man
oh that that was in the morning before i met you
the press was in front of my house
they are playing it like you just said it
they can not do that
oh where do you live Fairyland
of course they can do that
okay Eli what now
Well he is burned as a spokesman
you are going to have to get all the cheese off all the shelves in illinois
what
no i do not think that is possible
he just blamed the victim
it just became possible
ALlCIA
Owen thank you so much
i have been in mediation all day could not get away
how are the kids
Good
Grace is bonding with a shy dance teacher and Peter told Zach that he slept with another woman
what
oh Grace is bonding with a
no what did Peter say
oh yeah he told Zach your son that he Peter was at fault for you kicking him out
' cause he slept with somebody else and so now i am wondering who that somebody else was
Zach told you this
he did
and what did Zach say to him
to Pe nothing
i think he just took it in
so who who is it
i have to go back to work
Come on
Alicia work is like this new avoidance tactic for you

Zach's fine
Zach he is he is wondering how you are

laughs
sighs
Call

Gretchen
the reporter
through your firm
i have no idea what you are talking about
Hmm so are we gonna play cards all night or are we gonna negotiate
how about both
you lose this hand you convince your client to take my deal
i lose this hand i convince my client to take your deal
what deal 10 million
and if i lose
she takes 500 000
so that is your bottom line huh 10 million
i miss you will i really do
Why did you drop out
i did not
Moved on
to
Adulthood
as i remember we did some pretty adult things ourselves
Come on one bet
we settle this like adults
no mediator
Your lady friend will be so impressed when you show up at her door with 10 million in your hand
no thanks
oh come on
where is the old will
Embrace the risk
no thanks
Wuss
laughs
Too bad you would have won
door opens
anything
they want to pay 500 000 but they are willing to go to 10 million
chuckles you are kidding
Nope
we were willing to take 5 million
chuckles
the only bad news is i do not think she planted the story with Gretchen but i can not tell
she is a good bluffer
anything else
yeah she is gonna try to play you
in what way
Jealousy
Using your past
to what end
Rattle you get you to admit the bottom line just for the kick of it
chuckles
so you and her huh

i just do not see it
i was a different person
and she is the same
oh yeah
Well
what if i play jealous for the mediator
Maybe you should
chuckles
Tantric sex

Delaying gratification is to increase gratification
yeah but i have spent the last three hours doing laundry and the kids are gonna be home in a couple of hours so i do not really have time for delayed gratification
door opens

Find a box for this and keep it in that box
Thank you
Celeste and will shouting
we are not paying a cent above her medical bills
then let's go to court
you failed will
i do not have to put up with this
Just face the fact
okay stop
how did i
the point of bringing you two together is to talk not to shout
i know what it looks like when he fails and he is failing
Alicia talk to him
Excuse me
i am just saying will and i talked last night
WlLL
Celeste
what
and we were trying to negotiate a deal but clearly his ego got in the way and i used to be able to talk to him
i can not talk to him now
so you will have to talk to him
Celeste what are you doing
i am talking to her
i am just saying that will and i got together we had a productive session that is all and i was thinking we should do that again
okay i think we have taken a turn towards the personal and what i think we should maybe
Excuse me
WlLL
okay you want to be productive
Let's be productive
you already tried the blame the victim defense with your painkiller O D fiction
that did not work
who is saying it did not work
i am
Well we will prove the opposite in court
no you won't
i know the judge
he won't allow it
so maybe you should raise
Jason Doyle
Zuggler Med project manager
Deposition 207 page 13
what is this
the backup plan
Question
so you believe you were within your rights
to manufacture this SCS device
and Dr Farland was within his rights to implant it in his patient
of course
According to the FDA's own rules
but Mr Gardner seemed to imply that Dr Farland was Josef Mengele
Josef
the
that is okay
FDA rules say that you were within your rights to manufacture this device correct
yes
they allow manufacturers like ourselves to decide which devices need to be submitted to them for approval
and if a new device is merely a minor modification then according to FDA guidelines it doesn't need approval
Ms Serrano's reading is surprisingly selective
Why do not you keep going
what is this
that
it is a BR1
it is a spinal cord stimulator
and this is FDA approved
yes
and you claim that Dr Farland's SCS is a minor modification of this
yes
that is why we did not need to submit it to them for approval
so then what is this
that is Dr Farland's SCS
so you are saying that this is a minor modification of this
CELESTE
Ira you can not judge these with a layman's eye
Medical professionals who manufactured Dr
Farland's device concluded that these two devices were similar
These two
yes
in fact i anticipated
Mr Gardner's bringing this issue up again so i had a study done by the respected Benzor Labs in Quantico Virginia
what is it say
that it is a minor modification
the mediator's on our side
Yup
Nice job by the way but he still was impressed by this
okay so we have to get someone to say it was vastly modified
we need Kalinda
i want to repeat this is only a precaution
phone buzzing
we are removing all Karpwell cheese from circulation
yeah
Gretchen i am kind of busy right now
what do you need
so you are the man behind the cheese Eli is that right
i am the
who told you that
an unnamed source
and what else did this unnamed source tell you
he said you are crisis managing for the listeria outbreak and that you investigated Heather Farms and the outbreak's not from there
NEWSWOMAN the political revival of scandal plagued State's Attorney Peter Florrick
he is also known for being a tough infighter
though never confirmed Eli Gold was also thought to be the architect of an ugly racial attack on his opponent
so why is this wholesome brand hiring a spin doctor known for rehabilitating scandalized politicians
are you there Eli
hello
NEWSCASTER
Eli Gold
GRETCHEN
any comment one of the first political campaign managers to understand the power of social media
i am not part of the story
oh
i am sorry Eli
you just became part of the story
so pull up a chair makes him a highly sought after crisis manager
it is not all bad Eli
it is all bad
you become the story it deflects from your client's guilt
i become the story it makes my clients look guiltier
who leaked it Diane
Eli it is a fool's game to look for a leaker
Gretchen knew we checked Heather Farms
she knew it was clean
i told two people about that you and Kalinda but Gretchen said the leaker was a he
Did you tell will
oh he went to the kids' vigil
i thought you said he was burned
he was
you are changing the subject
i am
so you tried to un burn him
you haven't seen this yet
gasps on TV
oh my God
yeah
it is wonderful is not it
People love humility
Tony Hayward needed a pie in the face
you did not
oh set it up
no
that was just luck
i thought he'd just get booed
MAN on TV to the services today
i am proud to be here today
i do not care in what condition
NEWSCASTER
Among those attending the prayer service was the CEO of Heather Farms Walter Kermani
i am good at my job Diane but i can not have leakers
it is unprofessional
will did not leak
crowd chatter piano music playing
so you are here to give up
Ten million and we won't accept a penny less
Really
laughs
you and your lawyer friend cook something up
it did not work for you to blame the painkiller
it did not work for you to blame the victim so minor modification
that is what your case rests on now
Dr Farland's SCS is merely a minor modification of existing SCSs
have some pastrami will
Let's leave all this boring medical talk behind
the problem is medicine is a lot like politics
and all we had to do was follow the money
she never was jealous was she
Your lawyer friend
that was all a piece of playacting
Dr Farland your man of healing invented an SCS to make money
30 on every device implanted
oh
Sorry
Sorry
who was that
Kalinda
here is a copy for you
what is this
Farland's patent application
yeah i know
it is a good read though
the problem for you is
Dr Farland had to insist on its originality
i get it
you do not have to lord it over me
no i won so you have to listen
Dr Farland had to insist on the originality of his device to file a patent
this SCS is a truly original development
in severe back pain management
it is not a mere modification
how nice of him to use those words of existing SCSs on the market
therefore patent
i can read
you are not going to be a sore loser are you
Eight million dollars
Ten
by today
laughing
no
Eight
that is more than you thought you'd get
i will talk to my client
i need a new home
you need a
New home

Litigation's going one way acquisitions another
how many in litigation
me
Eight other top flight lawyers
we need a home
i will check with Diane
i miss you
Ira
Hey
so it looks like we will make a deal
i heard
i just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work
you do not have to thank me
i was not the one who played them
we
that is not why we won
you won because of the facts
you got your client rich because you played them and me
that is not fair
it is fair
it may not be polite but it is fair
do not worry about it
if i needed a lawyer I'd probably hire you too
Very nice to meet you
Hey Mom
Just wanted to see how you were doing
how is your thing
it was good
i do not know
i go back and forth on work
yeah
Same with Dad
i want to do something very old fashioned
i want to kiss you on the forehead
is that all right
laughs Sure
Tucking in is too much
Right
Sorry
Love you
sighs
i am getting boring
Getting
i am serious
i used to be interesting
i spent the entire day doing laundry and watching daytime TV
i saw the clothes
Thank you
i mean when did this happen
you are the one out having sex with your boyfriend
Owen
and i am the one at home with the kids
and it is much appreciated
are you gonna get hurt by this guy
i do not know
i have no perspective
you should have rebelled in high school
then you would not have to do it now
is that what this is rebellion
or love
it is not love is it
no
Good
' Cause that would make it very complicated
Mmm

you remind me of someone
he could swallow a lot and now he had cancer of the throat
that is rich is not it

the doctors do not say the real diagnosis

D'you know how difficult it is to get hold of materials
i used to go to meet the trains
i waited for cement
and how did my children repay me

D'you think she has someone there
i think so
so do l
some things must come first
Sex is one
those are my flowers
what were you
you just kept painting the same flowers
Just these flowers
i knew one painter about fifteen years ago
SlTUATlON l
he painted very strange things
and there was something else they ordered him out of town in Action B
he stood in front of these people and said something
i can not remember what now but everyone laughed
everyone laughed
were you involved
no
what is the matter
i saw the light
i thought you were in hospital
you should switch it off
Thank you
i think he had a hat too
here you are
here is a coat hanger and clean the bath out afterwards
lsn't the young one here
not everyone can be young
could you give her this
Well all right

Guess
you are the one i love
i am happy with you
you must love me
are you happy
lf only you were a bit older
what is the matter
nothing
yes something is
Read me something
it is hardest for the wise where fools feel free
are you wise
i can not live with them
they cry i laugh
i laugh they cry
i love you
everything belongs to everyone everyone belongs to each one
Professor
I'd like to speak to the professor
i wanted to tell you
that time in the studio
i did not tell the truth in fact i lied
SlTUClA ll
i was there when they decided about that painter
there were people from other firms too
ln the end i got flu
i did not go to bed and rest
what are you doing here
it is cold outside
i am waiting for a prescription
how are you otherwise
i am alive
do you know the difference between a crow
None
all its legs are the same especially the left one
what is the matter with me Doctor
you are here so we can make a more exact diagnosis
you must trust us
i am not important
i discovered the ticket inspector was forging tickets
two years
i told them
the Director said
i do not believe lmre is dishonest
Comrade Director you understand
ln forty six they played good football at Kuchajda
Vaica Farka
Did you leave your post because you disagreed with something or you could not do your job
i left because i was ill
would you have left if you hadn't been ill
no
there was an official audit
can l
they fired the ticket inspector then me at the first opportunity
many are ill and they do not leave
i can see their thighs they were like this when they kicked the ball
lf I'd had cancer it would have spread ages ago
the worst was after the operation
i could not sleep i was scared
Maybe it is true that in life you reap what you sow
i think i am happy
i wanted to be a good actor
Conform not step out of line
because they can easily get the better of you
you know i have only got you
what about him
you are silly
Why do not you move out
i will have this brown dress dyed
i haven't got anything black
of course you like society
i do too but society doesn't like me
we must make way for young people
i do not get it this is something new
you smoke
how many
Four
Come with me
so how are you
you probably know better
everything changes but stays
in another form
can you imagine that
the only thing that lasts is human spite
it spreads everywhere
there is no medicine only substitutes
can it be cured
lf it is recognised in time
but it is only others who are bad
you are not contented
i only watch not interfering
i observe remembering what i see and silence is all around me
Good morning
everything all right
are you having radiation
Doctor have i got cancer or what
so far he is taken three thousand R
anything new
i had a pain here in the night
Lie down please
does this hurt
yes
i hear you want to go back to work
there is nothing left for us but to pack our things our former glory is no more
who is that
a girl i know
have you known each other long
Why do you ask
she is pretty
are you fond of me
yes i am
that coffee did not do me any good
do not talk so loud
Talk to me about something

what would happen if we broke up
two brandies
or bring us four
Why are you doing it

Thank you
Take off your coat
Help yourself

Well are you looking forward to it
it is already kicking
it is already kicking
Why
when the factory looks deserted girls from the socialist labour team sometimes go on a trip
you should go and study
what for
Marka Filekov is quiet and modest
the team says she must grow a bit
how do you make a living
my last job was as a model
i earn enough to buy soup
it is okay
i earn enough to buy soup
it is okay
i worked for television before that
they told me they are an educational organisation and can not employ people like me
it would be much simpler if abalov was not in the work team
are you expecting
i hope not
the woman who was here is your wife
no
have you got a boyfriend
i am still too young for that
here is your permit to leave
can you imagine but really imagine that some people were here before us not just a hundred years ago but ever
they said on the radio that there was a divorce in America the woman complained that her husband tickled her feet
the Mayas and lncas so many people
her husband protested that she always laughed so she must have liked it
they had their troubles or were fine
and all they left was peace and silence
Did they get a divorce
of course
there you are
Bring some Silvan wine
do not you want anything sir
no
Why
Hands up
this is the surprise

Laci

but we won't eat it
ls it true they eat flowers in China
because they are hungry
no just like that
Coming with me
i will wait for you
i put my article in the papers backed up by scientific facts
they cut it down and paid 20 crowns
that is the kind of people we have
are you Slovak
yes
then why are not you singing
do you ever dream two dreams
i often dream as many as three
do you want ketchup
you did this well
at least something
Well i was on my way to work
i met some young people they began to beat me up and i told myself it served me right
a way of taking comfort
everything in life turns out as it should you reap what you sow
we will have Christmas
when you are good or bad to someone you get what you deserve
i have got no excuse
Someone's come
no
have you told me all
this is a kiss of peace
why have you got your lD number on your back
Why
he has pains all the time around the liver gall bladder
Metastasis
they are gall stones
you believe cancer affects the whole organism do not you
yes i do
then call him in
i am from the insurance company Professor
you know me
you can undress if you do not mind in front of this gentleman
i have just missed my trolleybus
then wait outside
we want to operate on you
Throat
no
you took me in for my throat
will it help
we will try
i do not want to
Why do not you want to
Look Jnok took from the rich and stole from the poor
it is nice here is not it
so we won't be together any more
we could sleep here
my eyes are tired
so what is it you really want
it is not the same any more
THE lNFUENCE OF LlTERATURE ll
some people can not learn how to live
you will learn
Did you love me at least a bit
oh yes
i have got a letter back there
i must take it to the hospital
i must explain something to him
Marta take off your glasses

her lD card says she is divorced
i am her ex husband
Show me your lD

Heart
her heart stopped first

I'd buy it from you
when did it happen
when did it happen
what time
what did you say
at what time
around ten
i do not know whether she loved you or whether she hated you
Say something
Go on
she spoke about you how you got on her nerves when you did not say anything
where do you get the assurance of a fool
what do you want
you freeze out anyone who is just a bit different
Why did you go back to the kitchen
Why weren't you a better comrade
Say you were mistaken
that you were mistaken
no
and you are happy with the results
who do you do all this for
Tell me you have never truly believed
Won't you say it
lf you do i will give you a letter from your wife
it is stones sir
it is clean
can we remove it
D'you know what the consultant said
that it was to be expected
how is it with his throat
you need a holiday
ln advanced and neglected stages serious but by no means incurable
the consequences of the fast growth of foreign tissue are grave because it develops without regard to the needs of the whole organism
do you need something
i had tonsillitis
Come outside
my things are in there
do not you want to
i am expecting
but it is not yours
Peter
i just invented that
should i call you
i came twelve minutes late he began to make a fuss but we made it up in the evening
D'you know how
Why are you whispering
i have got a patient with a fever in number twelve i left the door open
he is already calling me
we drank
do not drink
Young and strong
does that hurt
they were in my care
Sign
you should not talk
an old woman if you went it was good to make them afraid if you did not go it was for the cause
it is okay okay and that old old man
it is okay Mr Lauko okay
i was holding we were drinking a revolver
you must not talk
i shot a cow
Surely not
the old woman screamed you will pay for it all one day you will remember my words
Did you see those Hungarian sweaters in the department store
that twinset
how much did it cost
Three hundred and twenty two
what did he say
some nonsense
he is got a fever
what would you say if that fellow got over it
and the highest value is Man human happiness freedom
that is an apple that is a meadow
that is a tree
that is a tree
yes
and that is an apple
that is an apple
it is snowing again
that is a meadow that is an apple that is a treeWater
Earth
Fire
Air
Long ago the four nations lived together in harmony
then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked
Only the Avatar master of all four elements could stop them
but when the world needed him most he vanished
a hundred years passed and my brother and i discovered the new Avatar an airbender named Aang
and although his airbending skills are great
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone
but i believe Aang can save the world
Book one
Water Chapter Five
the King of Omashu
the Earth Kingdom city of Omashu
i used to always come here to visit my friend Bumi
Wow
we do not have cities like this in the South Pole
they have buildings here that do not melt
Well let's go slow pokes
the real fun is inside the city
Wait Aang
it could be dangerous if people find out you are the Avatar
you need a disguise
so what am i supposed to do
Grow a mustache
Ohh so itchy
how do you live in this stuff
Great
now you look just like my grandfather
Technically Aang is 112 years old
now let's get to skippin' young whippersnappers
the big city awaits
you guys are gonna love Omashu
the people here are the friendliest in the world
Rotten cabbages
what kind of slum do you think this is
Noo
my cabbages
Just keep smiling
State your business
my business is my business young man and none of yours
i have got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside
Settle down old timer
Just tell me who you are
Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis the Third and these are my grandkids
hi June Pipinpadaloxicopolis
Nice to meet you
you seem like a responsible young lady
See that your grandfather stays out of trouble
Enjoy Omashu
we will
Wait a minute
you are a strong young boy
Show some respect for the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag
Good idea
this is the Omashu delivery system
Miles and miles of tubes and chutes
Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down
Great so they get their mail on time
they do get their mail on time but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes
Look around you what do you see
Umm the mail system
instead of seeing what they want you to see you gotta open your brain to the possibilities
a package sending system
the world's greatest super slide
Bumi you are a mad genius
one ride then we are off to the North Pole Airbender's honor
this sounded like fun at first but now that i am here i am starting to have second thoughts
i am on it
Men you will be going off to combat soon
it is important that you be prepared for anything
Aang do something
Use your airbending
Yeh
Good idea
that will make us go even faster
Sorry
my cabbages
you are gonna pay for this
two cabbages please
Your majesty these juveniles were arrested for vandalism traveling under false pretenses and malicious destruction of cabbages
off with their heads
one for each head of cabbage
Silence
Only the King can pass down judgment
what is your judgment Sire
Throw them a feast
huh
the people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts so i hope you like your chicken with no skin
Thanks but i do not eat meat
how about you
i bet you like meat
is it just me or is this guy's crown a little crooked
so tell me young bald one
where are you from
i am from
Kangaroo Island
oh Kangaroo Island eh
i hear that place is really hoppin
what
it was pretty funny
Well all these good jokes are making me tired
Guess it is time to the hay
there is an airbender in our presence and not just any airbender the Avatar
now what do you have to say for yourself Mr Pipinpadaloxicopolis
okay
you caught me
i am the Avatar doing my Avatar thing keeping the world safe
everything checks out no firebenders here
so good work everybody
Love each other respect all life and do not run with your spears
we will see you next time
you can not keep us here
Let us leave
Lettuce leaf
we are in serious trouble
this guy is nuts
Tomorrow the Avatar will face three deadly challenges
but for now the guards will show you to your chamber
my liege do you mean the good chamber or the bad chamber
the newly refurbished chamber
Wait which one are we talking about
the one that used to be the bad chamber until the recent refurbishing that is
of course we have been calling it the new chamber but we really should number them
uh take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad
this is a prison cell
but it is so nice
he did say it was newly refurbished
Nice or not we are prisoners
i wonder what these challenges are gonna be
we are not sticking around to find out
there is gotta be some way outta here
the air vents
if you think we are gonna fit through there then you are crazier then that king
we can not but Momo can
Momo i need you to find Appa and bust us outta here
Go on boy get Appa
Eh how was Appa supposed to save us anyway
Appa is a ten ton flying bison i think he could figure something out
Well no point in arguing about it now
Get some rest Aang
Looks like you will need it for tomorrow
Sokka
Katara
where are my friends
the King will free them if you complete your challenges
and if i fail
he did not say
Your staff please
first Avatar what do you think of my new outfit
i want your honest opinion
i am waiting
i guess it is fine
Excellent
you passed the first test
Really
Well not one of the deadly tests
the real challenges are much more challenging
i do not have time for your crazy games
Gimme my friends back
we are leaving
Ohh i thought you might refuse so i will give your friends some special souvenirs
those delightful rings are made of pure genemite also known as creeping crystal
it is crystal that grows remarkably fast
by nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it
Terrible fate really
i can stop it but only if you cooperate
Ah
it is already creeping
i will do as you want
it seems i have lost my lunch box key and i am hungry
Ooo there it is
would you mind fetching it for me
Ooo climbing the ladder
no one's thought of that before
that is right
Keep diving head in i am sure it will work eventually
there enjoy your lunch
i want my friends back now
uh not yet
i need help with another matter
it seems i have lost my pet Flopsy
okay found him
Bring him to me
Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsy
Come here Flopsy
Flopsy wait
Flopsy
Flopsy
Wait a minute
Flopsy
Flopsy
Awww that is a good boy
yes who has a soft belly
Guys are you okay
other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body doing great
Awww yes
Come on
i am ready for the next challenge
Your final test is a duel and as a special treat you may choose your opponent
Point and choose
so you are saying whoever i point to that is the person i get to fight
Choose wisely
i choose you
Wrong choice
you thought i was a frail old man but i am the most powerful earthbender you will ever see
can i fight the guy with the axe instead
there are no take back sees' in my kingdom
you might need this
Typical airbender tactic avoid and evade
I'd hoped the Avatar would be less predictable
do not you have any surprises for me
Sooner or later you will have to strike back
oh you will have to be a little more creative than that
Did someone leave the windows open
it feels a little drafty in here
are you hoping i will catch a cold
how are you going to get me from way over there
Hehe
Well done Avatar
you fight with much fire in your heart
huh
you have passed all my tests
now you must answer one question
that is not fair
you said you would release my friends if i finished your tests
oh but what is the point of tests if you do not learn anything
oh come on
Answer this one question and i will set your friends free
what is my name
from the looks of your friends I'd say you only have a few minutes
how am i supposed to know his name
Think about the challenges maybe it is some kind of riddle
i got it
Yeh
he is an earthbender right
Rocky
you know because of all the rocks
we are gonna keep trying but that is a good backup
okay so back to the challenges
i got a key from the waterfall
i saved his pet and i had a duel
and what did you learn
Well everything was different than i expected
and
Well they weren't straightforward
to solve each test i had to think differently than i usually would
i know his name
i solved the question the same way i solved the challenges
as you said a long time ago i had to open my brain to the possibilities
Bumi you are a mad genius
oh Aang
it is good to see you
you haven't changed a bit
Literally
uh over here
little help
Genemite is made of rock candy
Delicious
so this crazy king is your old friend Bumi
who you calling old
okay
i am old
Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were
first of all it is pretty fun messing with people hehe but i do have a reason
Aang you have a difficult task ahead
the world has changed in the hundred years you have been gone
it is the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai
you have much to learn
you must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord and when you do i hope you will think like a mad genius
and it looks like you are in good hands
you will need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation
and you will need Momo too
Thank you for your wisdom
but before we leave i have a challenge for you
my cabbagesfrom New York the greatest city in the world it is the Late Show with David Letterman

here now is the sure sign that it is spring in New York City
Earlier today Regis opened the windows on his apartment and aired out his money
Beautiful day in New York City today
so nice the AlG executives were counting their bonuses in the park
so sunny Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez came out of a whorehouse squinting
here is a story that just keeps getting better and better
Alex Rodriguez apparently goes to the same whorehouse that former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer used to go to
Listen to this
Alex's cousin is the guy who supplied the Viagra
Alex Rodriguez and prostitutes and i do not know why but Kobe Bryant's wife ended up with a diamond ring
i do not understand
you folks like celebrity birthdays
who doesn't
i got one for you
Happy birthday to Rosie O'Donnell
Rosie O'Donnell
Rosie O'Donnell 47 years old and happy birthday to Rosie O'Donnell but i am telling you something
i am beginning to wonder starting to worry a little at 47
is she ever gonna find the right guy
i do not know
here is some exciting news
you know Bruce Willis
our good friend fine actor Bruce Willis
over the weekend Bruce by the way is 54 years old got married to a former Victoria's Secret supermodel by the name of
i know her last name is Heming
Henning or Heming
Heming is her last name
Henning or Heming
Heming with an M
with an M
Thank you
i have no idea why you are applauding but it makes me feel good
we wanted you to feel better
they are applauding ineptitude
Apparently
anyway the woman is beautiful
30 years old
Bruce is 54 his wife 30 years old
Congratulations but
Doctors said be careful on the honeymoon
you could die hard
that certainly was worth the trouble was not it
it is the cough again
you know about this weasel this rodent Bernie Madoff
who is in prison now for 150 years because he swindled billions
50 60 billions from old people and charities
this guy swindled 65 billion and they sentenced him to 150 years in prison but somehow it is not satisfying is it
it is not satisfying
150 years prison and you know when he comes out they think the recession will be better but
and i got a call from Roger Goodell at the NFL earlier today and he said you know here is what we are trying to do for halftime at the Superbowl next year
we will get that Bernie Madoff out there and we will let victims come down there and they will bring hefty bags full of their own urine and we will put him right there at the 50 yard line and people can line up
Poof him with the
Poof him with the big bags
and i said Why are you calling me
but anyway now no wait a minute
it turns out now that Bernie Madoff's accountant was also arrested
this guy's also arrested
yeah what a pair
Bernie and his accountant
and you know what else
they were planning to put together a musical about the life of Adolf Hitler
These guys
Wow
yeah Bernie's in prison right now and at this very minute he is tapping out stock tips on the plumbing
how does Bruce Willis' wife spell her last name
does anybody know
with an M
with an M
yeah fine
Thank you
Bernie though wants to be a model prisoner today
he was teaching his Ponzi class
i want to tell you something ladies and gentlemen
Maybe you noticed this already
if i seem in a bad mood tonight it is because CBS just declared me a toxic asset
that is right
the Obama administration
are you aware of this now
they wanna unload a trillion dollars in toxic assets
i do not know what that means
a trillion
but do you know how much a trillion dollars is
a trillion dollars you put them all together that is almost as much as the AlG bonuses
a trillion dollars just about
Please
do you folks have March Madness
do you Feeling a little March Madness
and you know this weekend now the teams are all focused on getting to the Sweet Sixteen
it is the same goal as Octomom
Really
Octomom
by the way did you read about this
Octomom says she will never reveal the identity of the octuplets' father
never reveal the identity of the guy who is the father of the octuplets Octodad
will never reveal
and i thought well at least she can keep her mouth shut
Wait a minute
who said that
who said that
Anybody see the president last night on 60 Minutes
and he is getting a little loopy and who can blame him
because when the guy came into office first of all the campaign to become president
i mean that lasted seven eight years
and then he becomes president doesn't really get time off and he is gotta sit through that parade on inauguration day and that lasted another three four hours
and so he is exhausted and he is loopy so on 60 Minutes last night he was a little bit giddy and people are now saying
now wait a minute
is this guy
first of all i would not give this guy's troubles to
a monkey on a rock
a monkey on a rock
but people are saying is he taking things seriously
Well here
Take a look
oh no
there is gotta be a little gallows humor through the day
you know sometimes my team talks about the fact that if you had said to us a year ago
got a thing
Did you see it
is he
yeah i do not know
and now here is the example of political nitpicking
because nobody really knew how to criticize what the president is doing
because first of all the task ahead of him is impossible
and you know he is at least out there trying
so what really can you say wrong
Listen to this
Critics are now criticizing his overuse of the teleprompter
okay maybe he should think about stepping down
Overuse of the teleprompter
so we put together a piece here tonight
it is entitled Teleprompter vs no Teleprompter
Take a look
this was the time when we performed
in the words that are carved into this very chamber
something worthy to be remembered
i mean
Tell people why i say
i mean is it
this has been Teleprompter vs no Teleprompter
that is exactly what i am talking about
there ladies and gentlemen Paul Shaffer
Say hello to my buddy Paul
Thank you David
it is exactly what i am talking about
a two three
oh what a show
we will be right back with Hugh Laurie
Coming up after the break Hugh Laurie
i do not know if you remember last fall during football season
we are all excited about the Ball State fighting football Cardinals
because they had an undefeated record during the regular season and they did not win their conference but came very close
and then they went to some Bowl and then they got beat in the Bowl and they are coach left
and what is turned out to be a started out to be a happy lovely story turned out to be rather ugly frankly
Well listen to this
Ball State women's basketball talk about a program knocked off Tennessee 71 55 and they are going to the NCAA final weekend
the fighting Lady Cardinals
so congratulations and hats off and way to go
and my other tourney pick i predicted Butler would go all the way and meet Louisville in the final
Butler was defeated in the first game
but we have a guy here in a Hoosiers sweatshirt
does that mean anything to anybody
no
now here is a book ladies and gentlemen
it won't solve all your problems but once you solve this problem you will be able to take care of the rest of the problems in your life
and that is weight loss
have you ever tried to lose any weight
it is impossible
i will tell you what i tried a couple of weeks ago
Pancakes
you ever tried pancakes
i mean call the cops because you have them and you put a little butter and a little syrup on them and you have a stack of like a dozen
Well that is the problem
but we got a guy on
our good friend the man who saved my life
Dr Lou Aronne wrote this book and in a minute he is gonna come out here and make him feel at home because he is got a nice bright white crisp lab coat on
and he could not look cuter
and he gonna come out we are gonna talk about the book then George Clarke our building engineer is on this program and Lou started him on the program two weeks ago on this very show and we are gonna find out how much weight George has lost
George was 257
but now Dr Lou the author of this book put him on the Dr Lou regimen and we will just see in a couple of minutes here how George Clarke did in the last couple of weeks
it is impossible as you know to lose weight
but Dr Lou and wait'til you get a look at the lab coat
now here we go
Get ready
because this is something you are gonna tell your kids about
on Saturday March 21 2009 on Parrot Cay in the Turks and Caicos Islands
Bruce Willis was married to British model Emma Heming with an M
they have been dating for just over a year and they plan to have a civil ceremony when they return to California
so congratulations and we could not be happier for Bruce
okay that was Saturday on Parrot Cay in the Turks and Caicos Islands
now on Thursday at 3 p m March 19 2009 at the Teton County Courthouse in Choteau Montana
i was married to Regina Lasko
he is not kidding
he did it
Congratulations
Congratulations
you did it
all right now
he finally did it
Finally did it
now let me give you the tale of the tape on this
we
Regina and i began all right
it is a little bit of a surprise
we Regina and i began dating February 1986
that is what i mean
that is what i mean
and i said Well things are going pretty good
Let's just see what happens in about ten years
we have a five and a half year old son named Harry
yes you do
Justice of the Peace John L Pete Howard performed the civil service
so there you go
that is it ladies and gentlemen
that is beautiful
Congratulations
and people say Jeez Dave
you were together so long does it feel any different
and i say yeah
yes it
it does
oh my God
so what a big weekend that was for me
and i do not know what else to tell you but here we go
Please
they say Well why did it take you so long to get married
and of course the answer honestly is we wanted to make sure we had the prenup just right
it is too late for that
so what do we got here
Bernie Madoff is in prison and people have been wondering how he spent his time under house arrest
oh my God
that is right
before he went to prison they had him locked up in his penthouse apartment
Well we have some rare footage of Bernie and his lovely wife Ruth at home during those months of house arrest
Watch this
how can i help you
Package for Madoff
Sign here
have a nice day
yeah you too
i just love being an ass
okay
we will be right back with Dr Lou Aronne ladies and gentlemen
Thank you
Beautiful Felicia
Thank you
and i avoided getting married pretty good for like 23 years
and i honestly whether this happened or not
i secretly felt that men who were married admired me
you know
Like i was
Like i was the last of the real gun slingers
you know what i am saying
so now we get ready to go and we gotta drive into the courthouse and it is muddy
and we are supposed to be there at 2
so it is me Regina and Harry in the truck
in the pickup truck
i know Bruce Willis is saying what it is like i have a twin
so we get two miles from the house and we get stuck in the mud
i mean turn the truck over stuck in the mud
oh no
so now we think Well somebody will come
no
Nobody comes along
Nobody comes along
it is Thursday afternoon
who is coming along
Zorro
no
Nobody
so i get out of the truck and i walk two miles back to the house
into a fifty mile an hour wind
it is not Beverly Hills
it is Montana for God's sakes
Wow
and the whole way
i am thinking See smart ass
See
you try and get married this is what happens
See
Well you got nobody to blame but yourself
Could've happened any other day but you wait now
See
this is what you get
so then we get in the car and Harry says are we still going into town
and i said yes we are
and he gets very upset
because Mom had told him if i was not back in an hour the deal was off
oh no
we are going into town
we are going to town
Sit back there and be quiet
oh no
we are going to town
here ladies and gentlemen
i talked about this earlier and we are gonna have the weight in
George Clarke two weeks ago now we will see what he did
i do not know what is going on back there
so not just George his family his health but the career of this man right here Dr Lou Aronne are in the balance
Raise the thing and let's go back there ladies and gentlemen and see what is happening
here we go
hello
how are you
how are you doing
Congratulations
what do you think
huh
what did i tell you
George how are you doing
Good sir
how long you been on the diet here with Dr Lou
little over two weeks
two weeks and you are a guy who really liked to eat before and would eat with abandon
is that accurate
Correct sir
and so now it is kind of a radical change
was it so radical for you making this change
it was tough for the first three days
Did you feel yourself kinda a little lightheaded
a little weak in the knees
yes
what would you do when you got lightheaded and weak in the knees
Well Dr Lou told me to have some chicken broth
Chicken broth
Good
Good
and am i correct
you are trying to lose weight off your knees
is that what it is
and again this is an exact replication of Lou's office
so if you see him
Same thing
Same thing
all right
this book by the way will be in stores tomorrow
is that correct
that is correct
and it is going to be i am telling you will be an instant best seller
but you know George
it is not just you and your welfare and the health and concern of your family but Lou has put his life on the line here
i know
okay
so last week how much was it
two weeks ago it was what
257
257
what would you expect in two weeks on this procedure
i think he could probably lose ten pounds
Ten pounds
all right
okay
you ready
Hop right up there
what is that
12 pounds
11 pounds
11 pounds
11 pounds
Congratulations
Thank you boss
Wow
Lou you want to get on the scales
oh no
Well this is the
how long is he gonna be on the thing
for weeks
and what is your target weight
about what
210
we think if he could lose 20 30 you said 40 pounds
i think he'd feel great
we want to get his waist down to less than 40 inches
that is our goal
what is his waist now
his waist right now he started at 49
he is down significantly low
he is lost three inches from his waist
Three inches off his waist ladies and gentlemen
there it is
the Skinny on Losing Weight without Being Hungry
Nice job Dr Lou
we will see you soon
Nice job Lou
we will be right back with Hugh Laurie ladies and gentlemen
our first guest tonight stars as the voice of Dr Cockroach Ph D in the new animated film entitled Monsters vs Aliens
it opens Friday
Please welcome the very talented Hugh Laurie ladies and gentlemen
how you doing
i am doing very well thank you
Good to have you with us again
Thank you for being here
it is very good to be here
do you remember and of course i am sure you are in New York City frequently
Work and so forth travel back and forth
no
i would say no
i come here in my dreams obviously all the time
Really
but in reality less often
what was it like the first time
Remember your first time
my first time was
yes the first time i came was when we shot Stuart little
i was in a film called Stuart little
we shot for a couple of months in New York which i absolutely adored
i actually spent two months living at the Plaza Hotel
Well very good for you
i was like a little Elouise
although i actually did that was not my intention when i came
an American friend of mine recommended a very sort of British hotel that
it certainly was very British
it was that kind of Britishness that all you lot left Britain to come to America for
it was absolutely a miserable hotel
oh sure
and it felt like someone had died in the room about an hour before i moved in
and i thought to myself i cannot stay in this place
i have to leave
but it was about midnight so i can not go traipsing around the city
so i went downstairs and i hailed a cab
i thought
i will have just one night at the Plaza and then i will find somewhere tomorrow
and i hailed a cab and i said the Plaza Hotel
and the guy said what are you nuts
and i said no Well hello
do you want to go to the Plaza
and i said yes
it is a good hotel is not it
the Plaza Hotel is a very good hotel
it ranks amongst the finest
Well then take me thither young man with all due speed
so he then drove his cab about 12 feet
there you go
i could've
i could've gone in one side and out the other
Would've been just as good
so then of course i had to make up a story about how i had a bad back
i see
and that is why i could not lift my case
you are lucky he did not take you to LaGuardia and back
all right there it is
that will be 80 dollars thank you
but speaking of things English you received one of these
and i do not know how often they are giving out these knighthoods or
what are they BSEs or BOEs or
it is called an OBE
it is like a very very junior knighthood
it is like the first part of your kit on your way to getting a knighthood
and the initials
so they are like action figures you have to collect
it is a sort of
i am technically an Officer of the Order of the British Empire
Well very impressive
Again that would be something you all came here to avoid
and how do you know about this
are you
you campaigned for it
no
no i do not think so
no i just
it arrives in the
in fact they ask you if you were to be offered would you accept it
and there were very sort of mixed feelings in Britain
some people think it is a vestige of an antiquated imperial system
Why would they think that
and others think that you know it is just a
i actually asked my son my was 16 at the time
i said do you think i should take is it a good thing or not
he said You'd have to be so up yourself not to take this
so i
there you go
from a 16 year old
that was a very healthy response
but it is interesting to me that they mention in the congratulations
you have been awarded the OBE
are you interested
it just seems like well if you are worthy to be awarded it doesn't make any difference whether you are interested or not
you get it
you take it
you take it and be grateful
You'd think would not you
i suppose they just do not want a lot of Nah thanks
i won't
they are trying to avoid that
you think they do get that
i do not know actually
because they
it is possible
it is possible
but i took it and i went along and i
and there is the big thing and the Queen is there
Big thing with the trumpets and
Sure
Tailcoats and
and i met the Queen for about four to five seconds and she sort of completely glazed over
i could've said absolutely anything
i could've propositioned her and she probably would not even notice
Well that is how you get your award right there
but do you
who else was in your class of inductees
Well this is the slightly trying thing
the people there were two guys before me who were
and they read out the merits of their award before they get it
and these two guys were up before me and it was for defusing a bomb while under severe enemy gunfire
you know Corporal so and so and Sergeant so and so and they get their medal
and then the next up for services to the entertainment industry
it is just
Ouch
it is really
we each serve in our own way do not we
we answer the call
Let's see
Monsters vs Aliens and you are Dr Cockroach
have you done
this movie's gotta be a hit if your character gets a laugh
Dr Cockroach people seem to like
that seemed to go well so far
have you done much
Cockroaches
i haven't
Animation
so voiceover
i have done some in Britain but this is the first time doing a big American one
and it was
i mean the cockroach is
it is a troubling thing to be offered this because you have no way of knowing whether they had a cockroach and thought now who do we get to play oh i know
it is that guy or whether they wanted me in the film and they said
Well what is he gonna play
oh i know
a cockroach
you can not win either way
Neither one is good
Let's
this thing the movie opens Friday
and let's show a clip here Hugh
what are we gonna see
we are going to see
Reese Witherspoon plays a 49 foot tall woman
now do you get
Wow
49 foot tall woman
Somebody would have to put you up to it
Wait a minute
Let's take a look
it is Hugh Laurie as Dr Cockroach in Monsters vs Aliens
Throw the switch Doctor
but do not do the laugh
now you are going to feel a slight pinch in the brain
Sorry
Susan
Yoo hoo
Am i small again
i am afraid not my dear
in fact you may actually have grown a couple of feet
Dr Cockroach
Very impressive
i would not be surprised if you get another award
you think
yes i think so
the film opens on Friday Monsters vs Aliens
and then also we did not even mention the show of course
how long have you been doing that
it is coming to the end of our fifth season
oh good for you
Hugh Laurie ladies and gentlemen
Thank you
Good to see you
Thank you very much sir
we will be right back with Sarah Paulson everybody
be sure to tune in to tomorrow's Late Show
David is joined by Mary Tyler Moore Gossip Girl's Blake Lively and musical guest White Lies
our next guest stars on the new television series
Cupid which premieres March 31
Please welcome the lovely Sarah Paulson ladies and gentlemen
how are you doing
i am a little nervous
are you nervous
i am sorry to hear that
what about
Why are you nervous
i am afraid that i am gonna have a stroke
Like literally
i can not feel my fingers or my feet
you know we have Dr Lou here
i might
i might actually
i need his services
do you have do you suffer hypertension
in my mind i do
i really
you are a hypochondriac
Incredible hypochondriacal
we are kindred spirits
i also am a hypochondriac
i do
i am always worried i am about to have a stroke
you know
you sort of feel like tasting pennies in your mouth
now have you ever actual any actual serious illnesses or disorders
no just imagined
Just imagined yeah
See i used to be a really really inveterate enthusiastic hypochondriac
and then i had open heart surgery
that pretty much knocks it right out of you
when you finally have something like that everything goes away
does this manifest itself regularly
yeah
i would say i was a bit of a nervous person
yes it is not good
i mean i am sort of seeing spots right now
Really
there is one there
and one there
Wow
Boy this sounds awful
when are you at ease in your life
never
Really
yeah it is bad
it is really really bad
you wanna feel my hand a little more
that is very that is wet right
yes it is
yes it is
can i drink this
'Cos my tongue's sticking to the roof my mouth
Thanks so much
and what will and i do not want to dwell on this but what kind of a situation will make this condition worse
i guess being on a TV show is probably not ideal for you
no that actually
i can sort of
that i can do
it is bizarre
Getting on an airplane is not good for me
yeah i get a little nervous about that
Especially when i have this ritual where i like to talk to the pilots before i fly
and just a sort of going in the cockpit and check everything out
Make sure it looks good to me
since you know
i know a lot about what all those gadgets are supposed to look like
but i think that they tend to sort of mistake my anxiety for some sort of flirting
so inevitably i will get a box of chocolates or a drink sent to wherever i am sitting or a note that sort of says
Hey if you wanna talk more about your anxiety you can call me at
and it is very bizarre and i just sort of think
Hey sir really
do me a favor
do not be writing down little notes and sending them to like 3C or 39D because i need you to focus on the task at hand
Fly the machine
that is right
have you taken any of these classes where they help sort of ease your fear your anxiety about flying
no because i am quite attached to my anxiety
i am afraid that it is my anxiety that is actually keeping the plane aloft
which is like
Wow this just gets stranger and stranger
so this is multifaceted is not it
oh yeah
i mean you are not kidding around
you are not a beginner
Well i am glad you are
i hope you did not have a tough trip coming in
you came in from California
i did not come in from California but i do often fly back and forth
' cos i just moved back to New York and it does cause me to be on the plane more than I'd like to be
See i would like to talk to you about this but i do not want to be misinterpreted especially now that i am married
because i think i can help a little
i do not know that i can help completely
okay
I'd love to know
but you have also done theater here in New York
i have done a theater in New York
yes i just said a theater
that happens also when you are nervous
Well that is all right
you say a when you are not supposed to say a theater
it is kind of hip actually
Sure
the theater
i did a play recently that was directed by Kathleen Turner
which is a sort of wonderful experience
she is really great but she has that very recognizable
her voice seems to be getting deeper and deeper and deeper
it does in fact and every night before i go on stage she had sort of recorded the announcement that suggest the audience to turn off their cell phone
so every night before i got on stage i hear
Ladies and gentlemen please turn off your cell phones
if you have any gum or candy please unwrap it now
Very strong
do you do any other impressions
i do
what else do you have
i have Holly Hunter
Holly Hunter
okay
Dave listen
it is great
i mean i thought you were great
i mean i am so excited to be here
my show Saving Grace it is a great show
and i mean it is great
i love this audience everyone's great
you are great
Also very good
a dolphin is that right
is that a dolphin
would you like to see that one
okay
Wow
do that in the cockpit
Everything'll be good
and finally
and this i like this because it is a little
i mean this is a specialty impression
Julia Roberts but Julia Roberts smiling
is that correct
and from the side
Smiling and from the side
okay all right
Let's take a look
are you ready
i am ready
yeah
okay
all right
you and Julia Roberts do bear a pretty strong resemblance
i wish that were true
no it is true
so we are gonna have to take away points for difficulty

i am Ned Grable Vice President and General Manager of WFL
we think Mrs Jeff Johnson did the right thing in not running for the congressional seat left vacant by her husband's death
Jeff Johnson's name may still be magic but it will take more than the magic of name recognition to solve our region's problems
i am Ned Grable
Name recognition
Lordy what a notion
People would have to be some kind of boobs just to vote for somebody because their name was Johnson
i remember once back in Georgia
they even elected a dead man
his name was still on the ballot and folks were just used to voting for him
Loretta
okay
Bye bye

Why
Miss Rifkin
I'd like to run on the Silver Foxes' ticket
i believe and care about you and your issues
that is what my son says but does he call
what makes you think a group of alter kakers is gonna support a man who hasn't clipped his first nose hair yet
because i can win
no no
a Republican can win
a Democrat can win
a Silver Fox can only make a symbolic point
Mrs Rifkin if you get me on the Silver Foxes' ballot line
and if you give me the support
Lf if

where the hell did you learn to speak Yiddish
Yiddish Accent
i learned it from Morris Elfbein da gin king of Miami Beach

Jeff Johnson
the name you know
Jeff Johnson
Well that is a name even our Alzheimer's group will remember
i am not quite sure i understand Professor Franklin
you did your doctoral thesis on my husband
yes Mrs Johnson
Your husband was a very great man
he did so much to help my people
i remember the time he said that welfare is a drug and you have to kick it like cold turkey
and at the time i was on welfare and i did just that
it inspired me to get on with my life
Very inspirational
yes well really i am sure if he were alive
i was actually in the audience one day when he looked out and he said
if you people'd just get off your dead asses and go look for work maybe America can be a decent place to live in again
that inspired me
my God it made me move my ass
and i have a poster of that on my wall and i show it to all my relatives and friends and Negroes
Really well
it is kind of you to come all the way from
where was it
the Wilson Pickett State uh Teachers' College ma'am
but i did not just come here to pay my respects to your husband
i came here because because your husband deserves an archive where students can study his legacy
so you want his papers
not just his papers ma'am
i would like all buttons and posters and bumper stickers and all the campaign paraphernalia you can spare ma'am
i know you may have a sentimental attachment to a lot of these things and you
Take'em
Pardon me
Take'em all
do you want the wedding photos too
oh i do not know if i think that is necessary
that is lucky
so you won't have to go rooting around in the garbage

Laughing
Well Congress needs your new blood and you in turn are gonna need new friends
that is why tonight we unite the two great pillars of our system
Political and financial
now you know Congress has taken many hits of late
but Congressmen look around you
the people you see here tonight are the ones that have stood behind us
and they are the ones that will be invaluable to you in your next campaign which i might remind you is less than two years away
now this is our system of checks and balances at its very finest
Dick Dodge from your home state
Gonna run for speaker
Raises more money than any other member
but of course he is on the right committee
which makes all the difference
yeah of course
but i am not telling you anything you do not already know

not just on the committee
he is chairman of it
the big boys have to line up to take numbers to throw money his way
Your friends can always call on you
no shit
Woman
Thank you very much
Dodge
oh uh Mr Johnson
you know it is customary for the new members to pay a visit on us old fogies in the leadership especially from your home state
Well i would have but i just got in town
i am sorry man
you know you can make up for it by having a nightcap with me
oh absolutely
can i have my car take you home
uh excuse me Mr Chairman but you ain't about to start no homo shit are you
'Cause i ain't with it
oh
Hey
no
but that is good thinking Thomas
i am impressed by your instincts
i did not wanna have to whup your ass
Laughing

Tell me Mr Johnson why'd you come to Washington
Well of course it is an opportunity to do something for my country and

yes they call it the honey pot
each member is constantly being lobbied by every cash rich trade group in town
oh it is 2 40 a m
Did you realize that
Ah man forget that
we are public servants
Time ain't supposed to mean nothin' to us right
how do i get on this committee
um that would be seniority
uh after six terms in office uh say 12 years of service your name moves along the list and before you know it you are off the Fisheries committee and on to Power and Industry
can this wait
i am much more coherent in the morning
no you are doin' fine
but i need to know how i can get on this committee like immediately
okay okay
all right all right
uh immediately
Immediately

that is why i hired you
you might be standin' here in these fire engine boxer shorts but i have faith in you
i am countin' on you
Talk to me Reinhardt
yes thank you
i do not think it is possible sir
it would be unprecedented for a freshman congressman to be put onto that committee
Unless
Well only in the most remote hypo hypothetical situation
yes
this is ridiculous right
for instance
Well if the uh President of the United States were to do you a personal favor
or uh some enormously powerful special interest group
Chairman Dodge please
will you tell him that it is Mr Joshua Benjamin from the NAACP on the line
no ma'am actually you will be of a great deal of help
i have a few minor questions
i would like to know how many members of the chairman's committee are African Americans
None
Well i am sure you have a Latino member on the committee
no Latinos either
does the chairman have any Asians or any Native Americans on the committee
no Asians and no natives
does the chairman have any handicaps or gays on the committee
no gays
Well you have been of a great deal of help
Just forget i even called

Great
it is about committee assignments
now that is interesting
that is just the thing i had in mind
Go ahead
for the last two days i have been getting approached by a bunch of chairmen from different committees
i have been approached by the people from Foreign Affairs
i have been approached by the people from Ways and Means and Armed Services
they all want me on their committees and i do not know why
i will be damned
you can understand my dilemma' cause it is like with Foreign Affairs you get to fly off to Paris whenever you want
with Armed Services they got bases all over the globe
Son are you familiar with my committee
Power and Industry
oh yeah
but uh it is not as well known as these other committees
Well maybe not but you have been very frank with me
i am gonna be extremely frank with you
These other committees they are nickel and dime stuff
Power and Industry think of what we cover
Energy transportation insurance the environment
Hell son there is no better committee on the Hill
that is if you are interested in fund raising
i am very much
it is just that these other chairmen made pretty strong cases

i know why he was calling you
he hasn't heard from you about his fund raiser
a thousand dollars a head

Lovely

little fishin' in the afternoon clean air beautiful scenery
all to work up a good appetite' cause we got a fine French chef back at the lodge flown in special
oh
that is very very nice
you do not want anything from us
we would enjoy the opportunity to share our views
you see we feel that the semiautomatic weapon's gotten a bad rap
now the gun control nuts try to make out that they are for drug dealers only
but uh really they are just guns for the ordinary sportsman
Chuckling
Nothin' like a nice warm Uzi
Duck Call Quacking
Duck Call Continues
Quacking
Yee hee
must have had a heart attack
Aaah
and according to the 1988 study it showed eight per 100 000
Am i losing you on these mortality rates Congressman
no not at all
i was uh i was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem
and how much of it is a regulatory one
Mmm mm hmm
did not the Merton Act cover most of this
Excellent point
Excellent point
Let me check something out
Excuse me
you are absolutely right
Maybe we could get them to amend Merton
oh get'em to amend it
yes
Get'em to amend it huh
Well for Merton to apply you have to show high contagion
it sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod
Cold Common cold
Excuse me a second
Arthur
Ow
what were we talking about
How'd you wind up hustling for pro bono instead of pesticides anyway
'Cause you could have been a big time lawyer
i was for a while
but it depressed me
what could be depressing about makin' 100 000 a year
i know you gotta get sick of losin' all the time
of course i do
Mainly it makes me angry and the anger keeps me going
of course I'd like to win a few and i am not allergic to money either
so why are you doin' it
Hey
it is so embarrassing to come right out and say why i do it
Why
it is embarrassing for me to say
i just feel
Stop
what
Meaning
my life has to mean something
so now i have a question for you
I'd like to know how you got named after a memorial
oh
Chuckling
my grandmother liked Jefferson
you know life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
you know old black folks' thing
there is a lot to live up to so i kinda specialize in one portion of that
that is the pursuit of happiness
and how is it going
um
Honestly
Mm hmm
i was goin' real good' til i met you
now the better i do the worse i feel
is not that strange
Mmm when can i see you again
Let's go to dinner Saturday night
how about Sunday morning
oh oh brunch
the wages of sin is death
and to the man who values gold over goodness the Lord allows no exemptions
Congregation
Amen
Amen
and to the man who shows no respect for the privilege of walking this Earth the Lord allows no deductions
Amen
and to the man whose pockets are bulging and whose soul is empty the Lord grants no 90 day extension
and when the last trump sounds believe me you will be audited
this is a wonderful date
oh darling i am glad you could make it
oh i love that sermon Uncle Eli
this is your uncle
yes my niece tells me you are not half as slimy as i thought
that puts you somewhere between a lizard and a toad
Quite a step up huh
Thank you very much
Forgive me for staring
i do not know how i missed the family resemblance

TV Announcer trailing by 13 as we begin the second half
Man

TV Continues Indistinct
uh huh

TV Continues Indistinct
oh i slipped
Ellie

i need your help on the ethics bill Leon
i want you to cosponsor my amendments

i promise to give it the attention it deserves
Better luck next time son

he is so good
he took 600 off you that last hand did not he
he took a real shinin' to me
if i did not know any better
I'd say you lost to him on purpose
there is nothin' wrong with lettin' the head of the ethics committee roll ya every now and then
you know you are gonna fit in real good around here
Too good
how come you never ask me to help you out with your amendments
oh come on Thomas
Give it a rest
Everybody knows you are Dick Dodge's boy
Hey man i ain't nobody's boy all right
do not waste your outrage on me
i know what ya are
i am no different than anybody else up here okay
that is not true
you see some people here actually do something besides saving their own ass
you know just then you reminded me of my father
Did i really
how so
he used to say i was a scumbag too
Bell Ringing
are not you going to vote
is that what that means
you know all this time i have been listenin' to that shit thinkin' it was time for Final Jeopardy or somethin'
Chuckling
Indistinct Chatter
Thomas
Excuse me
Excuse me Congressman
i am Mrs Koslowski
hi i am leaving
we were just learning how a bill becomes a law
was that a vote
yes that was a vote in there
oh
oh
yes that was a vote
a vote was made
Bye bye
and what did you vote
Ah i voted nay
it was a terrible bill and it would have destroyed the fabric of American life
what was the vote on
Chuckling
Rafe
Rafe will you talk to these nice people
Explain to them about the vote
Well it was a motion on the previous question on the rule
no it was a motion on the recommitment of the rule of the motion of the previous question
which means
Clean air
School lunches
Ah you see the difficult choices we have to make here kids between clean air and school lunches okay
that is why i want to be the education congressman
See'cause i feel that American students should be able to eat lunch and breathe at the same time
and i see an America where there is no such thing as a student who is below average
and i think it is wrong when students have to stay up late at night and miss all the good shows doing homework
then get up early in the mornin' and go to school
this sort of thing just is not fair
Cheering
uh good morning
may i help you
yes i am Ellen Juba
this is my daughter Mickey
hi
We'd like to see our congressman
we live in the district
Just a moment please
Ah could you come out
Thank you
be right with you
i like your hat
how do you do
i am Miss Loretta public liaison for the congressman
Ellen Juba my daughter Mickey
We'd like to see him
Y'all from the district
Up here seeing the sights
How'd you folks like some gallery passes
Go listen to the great debates of our day
we do not wanna go to the gallery
we wanna see Congressman Johnson
Well how about a house key ring
for each of you
here see that
is not that something
Turns into a pen
i do not think you understand
we are not tourists
we are constituents
you are not with some organization are you honey
i am a goddamn citizen
is not that enough
do you have an appointment
no i do not have an appointment because y'all keep givin' me the runaround
Well i am sorry but the congressman is a very busy man
now if you'd like to discuss it with me i will personally go over the issue with him and get a letter out to you
we are not leaving here until we see him
Armando would you come out front
we have a situation
you stop palming me off on your flunkies
are you gonna go in there and tell him we are out here or am i gonna go in there and tell him myself
Excuse me may i help you please
yes you can
i would like to see my congressman please
he is not here today
i bet he is here
Excuse me
no no please lady
no you just let me by
no do not push
okay
Ya
Ya
Indistinct Shouting
i am sick of this
i am fed up
i have every right
Let go of her
Hey
oh baby
Come on Mama
Let's go
Hey
what happened to you
the doctor says they got it all
i am gonna be okay
i was lucky but but there are others
what others
other kids
they call it a cancer cluster
at first none of us in the neighborhood wanted to believe it
but then we all saw it
for me it was when the two year old across the street developed a brain tumor same as Mickey's
we looked at everything the water the air dump sites
Insects you name it
and then we realized it was starin' us right in the face
what
Power lines
High voltage power lines
the wires cause magnetic fields and the magnetic fields cause cancer especially in children
i have never heard anything like that in my life
Why do not you just come see for yourself
Children Laughing
this is Mickey's school
uh huh
it turns out a lot of schools are near power lines
Land's cheap so schools tend to buy it from the power companies
we are nobody Congressman
you are somebody
we need your help
Sighing
will you excuse me for a second
Come here
is this real
that depends on who you ask
some people say it is worse than asbestos or breast implants
Others say it is coincidental
Well you
what do you say
i think it is very suspicious that the White House would kill an EPA report saying that power lines probably cause cancer
they did that
yes
Sighing
Well i gotta do somethin' to help these people
do not tell me you are actually developing a conscience
oh God i hope not
It'd be a fuckin' nuisance in Congress
but if i were what could i do to help them
this goes beyond personal tragedy
it goes to a public health hazard of unknown proportions
it goes to the right of the ordinary people to know all the facts
yeah people ought to know if the neighborhoods are killing them
Amen gentlemen
Amen
and what a fine effort it is
i am totally sympathetic
Congressional hearings should be scheduled just as soon as possible
the American people deserve no less
Message we care
Turn this way please
Right here sir
Great
over here
Thundering
Cheers
you know son you are a real comer
i would not be a bit surprised if you ended up in the leadership
i will say this if i were speaker
I'd sleep better with you as a lieutenant
Thank you very much Mr Chairman
i am surprised to hear you say that
' Cause i really honestly did not think you was gonna go with me on this power lines thing
but i am not
but you said you are sympathetic
Well of course i did
we are all sympathetic to little girls with cancer
but i am not sympathetic to holding a public inquiry
you just said
i know what i said
but sound bites are not sworn testimony
now look son it is great to get your name in the newspaper
Let'em know you care
Very smart move Thomas
but that is as far as i would go with this if i were you
Intercom Buzzing
yeah

Thomas and i were just talkin' about uh power lines
Man i think we oughta have those hearings
Well now look Thomas why do not we get uh Olaf's take on this
Well it is tragic
Cancer's a terrible thing
but there is no way you can link it to power lines
the truth is
Wait a minute there have been studies
every study that says one thing i will show you a study saying another
we have studied this ourselves
Nada
what if all you guys are wrong
Thomas do you want us to move the power lines
you know how much it would cost to bury those things in Florida alone
we are talkin' 5 billion
not counting the liability claims
how would you like the people in your district to think of you as the fellow who tripled their electric bill
i just thought that if we had the hearings
Think for a moment chum
you hold your hearings
Overnight everyone who lives near a substation will find the value of his home in the toilet
you will kill the real estate market
you will kill the insurance companies
you will kill the school district
you will kill the local economy
Thundering
Son system ain't perfect
but the fleas come with the dog
Maybe i should think about it huh
Atta boy
Clearing Throat

Sighing

Just get him off of my back
another round
yeah why not
to the honorable Dick Dodge
Hey
by the time i am finished with him he won't be speaker
he will be lucky if they do not indict him
Eli people do things that they regret man
People make mistakes
Dick's been under a lot of pressure lately
Come on
Thomas you are Dick Dodge's yes man

when Dick says no i say no

but in this town you have gotta pick your fights
this could mean six figures Dick
High six figures
Seven figures
i suppose a million dollars is not too much to insure against losin' five billion
now you are talkin'
but how can i funnel this kind of money to you
if that is what you want we can find a loophole
no one will see your fingerprints
no one will know
no one will know
Olaf's just making a contribution as a patriotic citizen
and in return for that he is getting
Good government
Exactly
little access that is all
yes i am callin' from Chairman Dodge's office on the Hill
we wanted to be sure CNN was sending a crew to the clean air hearings today

Today's first business is a panel of national leaders in the field of utilities but before i welcome them the chair would like to yield to the distinguished gentleman from Florida
Thank you Mr Chairman
I'd like to make a very personal statement Mr Chairman
i would like to start off by saying thank you from the bottom of my heart thank you for your leadership and for your vision
but most of all I'd like to thank you for your courage
Especially for your courage
my courage huh
yes sir your courage in exposing the corruption that eats away at this institution
Your courage in taking on the special interests and your courage in taking a major new step
but l i have done nothing new
nothing at all
what are you talking about
this is true
because integrity is nothing new to you Mr Chairman
Integrity is second nature to this man
but still it is a rare public servant who will take on the PACs and the lobbyists and the fat cats and side with the American family who just want to live in safe neighborhoods and send their kids off to safe schools
Well i thank the gentleman but we really must move along
if the gentleman would
Ladies and gentlemen yesterday
i had a meeting with the chairman in his office with Mr Olaf Andersen of Gulf Coast Power and his lobbyist Mr Terry Corrigan
i thank the gentleman
but we really must move along
the subject of this meeting was the possible EPA investigation on power lines and the connection between them and increased cancer risks
Gentleman's out of order
now what makes this meeting different from most of the other meetings that take place in Washington was that the American people were actually represented in the form of this
oh
at Chairman Dodge's suggestion
i videotaped the entire meeting
huh
do not ya love that
is not that somethin'
Dick Dodge

END OF THE PROLOGUE
first episode the search for relativity
this is a film that should seem like a documentary and yet not be a documentary
it should seem as if it were filmed carelessly without paying attention by putting the camera just anywhere very freely
but in fact the film had to be extremely well prepared extremely well composed
BLONDE VENUS
here is Vnus
Count Muffat Chamberlain of the Empress
what was your perspective on the character of Nana in relation to the American films that you admired
Nana seemed like a character who was sufficiently haphazard sufficiently rough around the edges sufficiently
i don t want to say primitive to allow us to approach our ideal which at that time was we must admit American film
i think that Pierre and i got into film because we admired
of course we also admired Swedish and German films
but most of all we admired American films
Isn t that right
That s right
moreover we met because i had just returned from America
i had just worked in a small capacity on the film by Valentino called Monsieur Beaucaire
but i think our admiration for
I il name them the Chaplins the Griffiths the Stroheims the Fred Niblos the Clarence Browns to name a few in short the directors of the period
i think our admiration went beyond reason
our admiration was a kind of cult that was probably not always justified
and as a result my God we had very little desire to see French films
French films at the time which were called artistic films bored us
they seemed sort of monotonous slightly gray slightly slow
the truth is that our dream which was very ambitious was to contribute to French film which we loved and to France in which we were thoroughly immersed to contribute the possibility of more active livelier filmmaking and our model was the American motion picture
Isn t that true
Basically i consider Nana to be one of the first modern French films
It s a very important film
there was a great reaction against it but i think one could argue that it served as an inspiration
i think i remember one reaction to it
there was a preview of Nana at the Moulin Rouge with the Moulin Rouge orchestra accompanying the film with some airs by Offenbach if you remember
the audience seemed to follow the story very well but the people who were in the business were not at all pleased
and one very important person in the motion picture business
Madame Perret at the end of the screening got up and said  this is a Kraut film 
i had just returned from the war and i was really hurt
after all i was anything but a Kraut and that made me laugh
but it s always like that
the truth is that we wanted to contribute something to French film and we thought that as in all arts to contribute something you had to search elsewhere you had to search abroad
after all think of the Renaissance
the French Renaissance came from the desire to imitate the
Italian Renaissance but that didn t prevent the French Renaissance from being purely French
nothing is more French than Ronsard than Rabelais than Montaigne
Obviously though in their minds they accepted the idea of seeking inspiration abroad even in different centuries in antiquity
the Italian Renaissance is Greek and Latin antiquity
That s right
of course we discovered the French genius little by little
in any case as far as I m concerned
i discovered that we could feed off ourselves in France
but at the same time i believe this period of wild admiration for foreign films was useful
it helped sweep away certain routines certain superstitions that were then a part of French cinema
that said there were French films that i really admired
you can never form an absolute judgment about anything they just don t exist
Just the same the great French productions were mediocre there is nothing left of them today
the great French productions were above all very boring extremely  artistic
the word artistic was our enemy we hated it
Just the mention of the word art gave us goose bumps
we didn t want to produce art we wanted to produce films with a fresh spirit that would attract the public s attention
the Count wantes to be introduced to Nana
do not be surprised Monsieur Count she is a bit shy
there was much talk of an American influence concerning Nana especially Stroheim s
It s obvious
Stroheim influenced me in the beginning and he influenced you
It s obvious that he was the master
our teacher
which may explain Nana s reception the people who called you a Kraut
Maybe
That s possible
i believe mainly that there is a kind of fear in people who can be labeled reactionary a fear of what they re not used to seeing every day
Coffee comes with one lump of sugar give them a coffee without sugar or with two lumps and they are outraged
it is Kraut coffee
Francis pass me the comb
i do not think that the audiences were against it it was the producers those who believed they had an interest in this profession or who actually did have an interest in it
That s possible but i think that it went even beyond people s personal interests it was a kind of religion
It s the same thing when we explain to believers today that mass can be said facing the congregation instead of turned away from the congregation
many believers do not accept this and consider it a dangerous revolution in the Church
i think that man is a creature of habit that is his role and that is why from time to time God creates artists and my God it s a difficult role because you have to bear the wrath of all the people who do not like to change that is the majority
who can t change
or who can t change
but Pierre you shouldn t be sorry about it that is the way it is
it does us a lot of good
i think that having opposition gave us strength and the only danger is if we now consider our contribution to be the rule
the greatest danger for all innovators is that their innovations seem like gospel to them
Personally i know i have one fear and that is of becoming rigid
Cocteau used to say that the problem with youth was not a problem of age but of always being ahead of others
and the middle aged one will enter covered with gold
Want a bonbon
be good beg for it
on all fours
in any case one thing is for sure
you carry on your profession you continue you try to make films
the important thing is never to do anything concerning the details that is against your true beliefs
I m starting to think now that the main theme of a film isn t terribly important
i believe more and more in the inspiration of the art of the Middle Ages or of traditional Indian art for example in which the frame is somewhat fixed it doesn t change much
within this structure you re free and within this structure you must be innovative
we can tell the same stories as do other directors whom we didn t like in the beginning
we thought these stories were pitiful but we were wrong
it was not the stories that were pitiful but the way they were told
Still monkeying around with those paints
you were out for a walk my love
i do not have time to play around
i was collecting my dividends
you mean'our dividends'
MY dividends
nothing here is yours
our dividends
ours
ours
i had just worked with Michel Simon in my earlier films in Tire au flanc and on purge bb and i was very enthusiastic
i found him to be an exciting actor and it seemed to me that the male role in La Chienne would allow Simon to do some new things
at that time the American influence was wearing off but the Americans still continued to amaze me and i thought that Michel Simon would surpass the Americans in this movie
and in fact he did surpass them not all of them but many
Details details that s what counts the most
i heard his voice you see
i heard Michel Simon interpret this character with a slightly monotonous voice with the voice we hear in the film now a voice that avoids outbursts highs and lows
That s why i was very happy to run across
i didn t choose Madame Berubet for the wife
Michel Simon brought her to me
he said to me  i see what you want you want me to have a slightly somber slightly dull voice and opposite me you want a wife with a loud voice
in that case I m going to bring you Berubet  and he brought Berubet who is in any case an admirable actress
but this question of Michel Simon s voice was one of the driving forces in the film
the beginning is synchronized
the meal
everything is synchronized
there was no postrecording
there was no sound mixing either
no
there was no mixing at the time
you had to splice the tracks together end to end without combining them
of course you could overlap the sound when you spliced it and i did that several times to try to mask the passage from one shot to the next but it doesn t fool anyone
Why so sad
what is the matter
Troubles
do not you recognize me
you must have seen me someplace
i am sure she is got a picture of me on the wall if i know her just to get your goat
it is the moustache that throws you off
Sergeant Alexis Godard your wife's dead husband
Alexis Godard
you are not dead
of course i am
that is why i want to talk to you
but not here
Let's go to a cafe and i will explain
Michel Simon had just played Clo Clo for which he used a booming voice and it seemed to me that this man could give the dramatic intensity of the greatest actor in the world simply by using these seemingly drab methods
the contrast between the exterior means and the effect the dramatic effect
now as far as the other characters went
i think that little by little not in the beginning but as we shot
i realized that i needed other characters with loud voices
and i also thought it was good to bathe this so called realistic story that is a ridiculous word what does realistic mean
it means nothing
this story such as it appears what people call true to life it seemed necessary to bathe it in a kind of slightly hazy poetry
i counted a great deal on the actors' diction to help me get this effect and i think they helped me a great deal and the effect was achieved
this question of voices obsesses me terribly in film
i may be wrong but i took great care with this question of voices and i still do
it made me notice that accents bad accents the bad ways of expressing oneself on the screen or on the stage are the same in America where i worked sometimes and in France
it is the same especially with girls
the girls who come from acting school or from a conservatory all have the same obsession
they finish their sentences on an upswing the ends of sentences are always interrogative
they do not say it is nice out affirmatively they say it is nice out as if they were asking if it were nice out
i think it is a kind of coquetry a way of offering oneself
they say is not the sun shining today
as if they were saying take me
i like people to say is not the sun shining today and for the end of the sentence to drop and that is my great struggle with beginning actors and especially with beginning actresses
Excuse me for jumping to another topic and for going back to La Chienne
i just saw something that i found delightful
i have an obsession when i shoot films which is that i try to make the viewers think that the main characters shown on the screen are not alone in life that there are other people who live as well who love who suffer who drink and who have joys and pains
i hate the idea of isolating the main characters and when i did the meeting between Michel Simon and Warrant Officer Godard
i did not know
i could not add anything since it was in front of a boutique and i could not have it in front of anything but a limited setting because it had to be raining and my means for making rain were limited
i had only two or three waterhose nozzles and that was all
Consequently i had to keep a rather limited field a wall and no depth
so i had an idea that i am so pleased with because when i see the film no one sees it but me
it is the curtain going up
i said to myself
Keep that move that will give me a backdrop people may imagine that there is a shopowner on the other side who is living who has his own problems too
and at the same time a curtain being lowered is still a curtain
you like curtains
there is a hint of the theater that suddenly hits you when the curtain goes down
but why did you have to have rain since it was not raining
oh there is no reason for it
it seemed to me that a meeting like that could happen only in the rain
there is one thing that stands out in La Chienne which is its relationship to other films not only silent films but other films of the period
it is a film that was shot with many long takes with shots that follow the actors for a long time
there are two reasons for that
one is that i already believed in the necessity of not cutting the actor's inspiration by making him work with short takes
i still believe that
i believe that once an actor gets started you have to let him finish his race
the technique of shooting this race bit by bit is therefore dangerous in my opinion because you also risk cutting the actor's inspiration
there is also the fact that i was still influenced by the techniques from the beginning of the talkies in which because there was no mixing you tried to work with several cameras and only one sound track
in fact you tried to avoid sound editing
so the idea of not doing sound editing meant not doing too much picture editing either
it was not just a question of style of a sought after style it was also a question of habits
i had acquired while shooting on purge bebe which was still when one had to be careful to not cut up scenes too much
but if i remember correctly on purge bebe is a film that was shot with several cameras
La Chienne was too
i often used three cameras in La Chienne and i like working this way now once again
i have always come back to this technique for the same reason so as not to cut the actor's inspiration
in La Chienne when two people had a conversation for example the conversation between Michel Simon and the warrant officer in the bistro
i had one camera for the master shot one camera on Michel Simon and one camera on Michel Gaillard who played the officer
and after that you work things out by means of sound editing because the sound is the same
but you also had scenes that were shot with only one camera or else if you had several cameras you kept the shots from only one of them
that happens too and i also had many scenes in which i moved the camera not to create a stylistic effect
i never believed in that
i am the slave of the acting and i do not ask the actors to work for the camera
i ask the camera to work for the actors and you can see that i already had many shots in La Chienne in which i moved the camera so as to follow the actors just so i would not cut off the acting
i used this technique later and to a much greater extent in Grand illusion for which an acrobat like my nephew Claude the cameraman was required in order to film certain shots
like that of the Marseillaise
Seeing him shoot that scene you really would have thought he was a pretzel or an ivy vine curled around the foot of the camera
i started to work this way in La Chienne
but nonetheless if we are talking about my concerns in La Chienne my main concern was above all with the actors even more than in on purge bb
it was mainly a matter of expressing a certain character of bringing him to life of making him digestible for the audiences
i will go a step further it was a matter of making the audience love this character who is basically a man who cheats on his wife who behaves in a dishonorable fashion and who winds up being a murderer
so it was a matter of making him likable and in order to make him likable i had to follow the slightest detour of his thoughts
i also had to show the people around him to show that if this man became a murderer it was because those around him were insufferable and that when you have people around like that you become a murderer like it or not
i thought that Wallstein
oh you know those art dealers they promise a lot but
Anyhow right now i am broke
Alright
i will see what i can do
we were talking about the character of Michel Simon who despite what he is makes himself likable to the viewers
he builds a bridge
all great actors are bridge builders
they build a small bridge between themselves and the audience
in my opinion Michel Simon is one of the greatest bridge builders
the bridge he builds is a boulevard
it also has to do with your technique
the fact that we follow him continuously means that we are always close to him
but you can not follow all actors
with many actors if you follow them all the time you wind up getting very annoyed because they are empty their heads are like little bells with nothing inside whereas Michel Simon is so stuffed with thoughts with doubts even with unpleasant thoughts often with a lack of confidence is so stuffed with questions with introspection that following him is exciting
so the character that Michel Simon brings to life or even that your other characters bring to life are never condemned in advance
they are nasty characters but one realizes that they are not as nasty as all that or that they have other sides
of course
when i joined the cavalry
i learned something essential essential to film to literature and to art in general
i learned that there are no black horses and no white horses
Only civilians or infantrymen say a white horse or a black horse
a true cavalryman says a chestnut bay horse or a light gray horse because there are always a few black hairs in the white and always a few red hairs in the black for example
that is my answer
nothing is absolute there are no absolutely mean people and there are no absolutely good people
Good people are often very mean and mean people very good
i think that Gorki says something like that
i vaguely remember a sentence in my film the Lower Depths
it is that murderers are not murderers every day that there are times when they are not murderers
that is my money you have got
never mind make free with it
do not kill me
it is not worth it
you just need a good lesson
Albert do not hurt me
i will work hard for you
i am so wretched
you are stupid to think you'd get away with that trick
i hope you have learned your lesson
Josefa leave that alone
after all i haven't done anything to you
if it is her
Get off
do not kill me eh
if it is her i am not sure if i will let you go
Toni let me go
when you shot Toni you had already worked with Pagnol
yes i had shot a film called Jofroi and another called Angle
and this is exactly how it happened
i turned up in the courtyard of the studio in Marseilles at the Peupliers and someone named Bourelly said to me
the boss wants to see you
the boss was Pagnol
i went up to see Pagnol and he said
Look Jean Renoir is working on a film Toni
he is looking for a lead and i told him you had the part
at that point i was stunned and i said
it can not be
what and the light in the room began to dim
it was simply Jean Renoir who had entered the room and who was standing in front of the window
Gabi has gone
he is gone
he is left me
he is left you
what did he say
nothing much
it is horrible
he would not desert an animal like this but he leaves me with this dead man
what am i to do
Did you really kill him for the money
Too bad i did not kill him myself
it is nothing
the trouble is that people will find out what is happened
i will be arrested they will take away my daughter
we will put him in the cart and pile dirty washing on him
People won't be surprised to see us pushing it
Remember that day with the wasp
i remember that
i will leave him in the wood with the gun beside him
People will think he shot himself because of his debts
if we meet anyone we will pretend to be lovers
i can do that
Toni why are you doing this
you are risking your life
i gave my life to you long ago
it is you
Toni is not Blavette it is Jean Renoir
you are joking
yes it is it is your method Jean
it is a marriage
you take an actor whether he is an actor or not
he acts like this and you make him into that and when he is finished he doesn't even realize it
i do not either
because i ask the actor to teach me my profession as you say that you learned yours from me but the actor gives me as much as i give him probably more
when i start i do not know a thing my friend
there are some guys who are really lucky
they come to direct and they know exactly what they are going to do they know everything
they say here is the script i am going to follow it
i will do this close up that like this and the feelings are this that
as for me i admit i do not know a thing not a thing
and you know everything
you are joking i do not know anything
i know nothing so i start with the actors
we talk i explain the idea and then suddenly the actor has a kind of flash a kind of inspiration
he says to himself that is it here it is
i have found it we will start there
and once you have found the point of departure you are set but you never find the point of departure on your own
Happy because i love you
Dear Maria
Happy because i love you
Passionately
Your beauty has wounded my heart
Happy because i love you
Passionately
but look inslde my heart
our love
Its beauty has wounded my heart
the truth is that what happens with me is that i am not always able to understand the meaning of a scene before i have actually seen it
i find the true meaning of the acting a scene even a word only after the words have materialized once they exist
as Sartre would say
i believe that the essence comes after the existence
Let's exist first and then we will see
i have to see something that exists in front of me and then i begin vaguely to understand the meaning but deep down i am really an exploiter
i ask the others to give me all the elements
i try not to bring anything to it myself
i want everything to come to me from without
yes but you manage just the same and i find that extraordinary because i see progress from the third rehearsal to the fourth
but i would be truly incapable of transforming that third one into the fourth and of making improvements in it
yes but there is also another thing i believe in which is that the benefits of rehearsals are superficial and mean nothing
it is the famous Italian method that is often talked about which is reading lines but not letting yourself give them any expression
you read it as if you were reading the telephone directory and then little by little a spark flies from a word and from this spark a good scene may follow
that is also called hypnotic suggestion
it is also called suggestion yes
but the important thing is not to start off believing that you know the meaning of the scene
you have to start off knowing that you know nothing and want to discover everything
each scene has to be an exploration
it is like Picasso always says
when i paint i start and i do not even know what i am going to do
that is very important
and i think that is the number one rule in art whatever art it may be
you must allow the elements of the act to conquer you
Afterward you may manage to conquer it but first it has to conquer you
you have to be passive before you can be active
Pass me the bottle
Let's have a sip
hello Mrs Cardes i have told you not to call me that

i can not stand him myself
then say no more
i just thought an old friend in a moment of difficulty
an old friend who is interested in my savings
but you are saying goodbye to a wreck
yes but one still capable of floating
Very nice cloth
These'll keep your head above water
i am not worried about you
you came for a first class ticket eh
you do not want me to travel third
i am keeping my money to buy dresses to look pretty
because you see Mr Batala
i am in love
no kidding
so in love
you always make me laugh
in love
Want money for a taxi
that is it
you are understanding
and i have a dinner this evening with influential people
i do not want them to pay
i am always borrowing from you old man but i will give it back
Why are you locking the door
you have the eyes of a child
at that time and even now
i was absolutely convinced that technology was at the root of intellectual changes in a profession of stylistic changes
i often tell the story of the impressionists and paint tubes
i claim and i talked about this with Reichenbach who thinks the same i claim that one of the reasons for the impressionist revolution in painting is the invention of tubes of paint
before they were invented paint was sold in little pots and when you put them in your pocket they turned over they weren't very practical
you could not go outside
but with tube's you could put them in your pocket you could put them in a little box and carry a palette the tubes a little bottle of oil and a little bottle of turpentine and you could go outdoors and paint there
this purely technical invention probably determined all the nontechnical stylistic discoveries of impressionism
any fish
Maybe there is maybe there ain't you must know how to catch them
this is just the place
we can eat at that little restaurant do you agree Madame Dufour
we will make our way round to it
so shady and cool
with swings too
what fish we will catch
we will have a real feast mark my words
Restaurant Poulain fish dishes a speciality parties catered for swings luncheon 2Fr 50
now just you stop that Monsieur Dufour
any fishing rods
do not you lend out fishing rods here
Fishermen bring their own
Let's go somewhere else
here i am and here i stay
Quite right my dear
we will eat here
Send your master to me
are you happy now you are here grandmother
we will have a good lunch
oh no i am hungry
i think there is a relationship among all the arts
after all it is a question of expressing oneself
the big difference between film and an art like painting is that many people express themselves in film
the actor has to express himself the technician has to express himself the director has to express himself
there is also another big difference which is that the means given to film directors are complex whereas the means given to painters are extremely simple
the truth is you can paint with a piece of charcoal on a white wall or at least draw whereas to make a film you need a camera film sound so many things
this is not to film's advantage because i think that technical resources are against what we generally call art
the more technical resources you have the more difficult it is to express yourself
you wind up drowning in wealth
i believe it is a great advantage for a painter to be able to paint anywhere he doesn't need much equipment
second when one's technical concerns are limited to the essentials these essentials become much more profound and become more special as well
i believe that a good painter is harder to find than a good filmmaker because a good painter since he doesn't have very advanced technology since he is limited in his means has to be more clever
you know the expression do not spread yourself too thin
i think that this is extremely important in art
the painter has the advantage of digging into the same little hole and he can go very very very very deep
he can even go so far as to find the relationship between eternity and the instant between the world and the spirit between the body and the mind
Painting can go very far
i believe that right now painters are the great philosophers of our time
there are a few filmmakers who have at times come close to something like that but in film let's be frank we are limited by the immensity by the magnificence of our means
i hope i believe i have tried in all my work
ever since i started to make films
i have always tried to make films because it was fun
my main goal was my own joy a joy that exists during the fabrication
the truth is that the result doesn't really interest me
i have several films that were successful
i have some that were notoriously unsuccessful but it is all the same to me the important thing is to create
i think it is the same in all aspects of life
i think that all people who are hooked on results and who pursue goals
i am convinced that they are extremely unhappy and that when they arrive at their goal they realize that the goal was not worth all the effort they made
Whereas the joy of working the joy of creating an object
once the object is created you put it aside the joy that the sculptor has in pushing the clay with his thumb or in chiseling the stone with his hammer or the joy the painter has in guessing the relationship between a blue and a red and in expressing a little piece of eternity with this relationship
it is while you are doing it that it counts
after that people say it is good it is not good
so what that is their problem
Let's go and find your father
she is a very nice girl
she is a smasher
if only she knew how to dress
i have made you a tarragon omelette
how about pig's brawn today
have you seen the Parisians
the woman's all right
the daughter you mean
no she is too skinny
you fancy the mother
what a woman
something to get hold of there
Elegant too
you are making my mouth water
i am too busy but if i were in your shoes
Listen to the old widower
what strikes me when i look at your films is their experimental side
you experimented with photography
with the choice of lenses with the choice of actors
yes of course
often it backfired
it is not always a good thing
i really believe that to succeed in anything in life you have to persist you have to dig in the same hole and i personally spent my time digging in twenty different holes and i wonder whether i was not wrong in doing that
but do not you think that this experimentation
you have to go very far with it
of course you have to go all the way
it is because i am extremely wary of the abstract
i am terribly wary of my own reactions
i do not believe that the world i may create will be as good as the world as it exists now
i believe in surroundings and believing in surroundings
i obviously believe in technology
not just because it is technology but to the extent that it is a hurdle maybe
it is a good hurdle one that you have to get over and in getting over it you acquire spiritual wealth that has nothing more to do with technology
because in the end when the film is finished the photography may be good or bad it is not all that important
some very great films have bad photography or bad sound
Certain films with magnificent photography and magnificent sound are nothing at all
but i repeat that this technology is necessary
because if you are not careful if you do not try to arrive at a kind of perfection in the form
i think you lose it
could we have our picnic here
it is nice and shady but what about ants
there are not any but there are cherries
could we eat some
we ought to ask permission
you will frighten the fish
do not you ever think what you are doing
what a lovely caterpillar
do not touch it you will get a rash
it is not dirty it eats grass only
how amazing the country is
every blade of grass hides tiny living things
we may kill some with every step
if you worry like that you will get nowhere
i wonder if such things are happy and sad like us
of course not they are not people
anyway they are too small
but they are born and die like us
i must say i wonder how caterpillars have their young
they do not have young
that one will become a lovely butterfly
you see some strange things
when you were young i mean when you were my age did you often visit the country
no more than you
i wonder if you felt as strange as i do today
Strange
Well you see i feel a tremendous sort of tenderness for the grass the water the trees
a vague sort of yearning
it is like a catch in the throat
it almost makes me want to cry
Did you feel like that when you were young
my dear child i still feel like that only i am older and wiser
Come and see
there are some capital boats
Your hat
Leave it
we will picnic here
my skirt is caught how messy the country is
they are skiffs Anatole
i know all about them
the motion picture is way behind painting
what is done in painting is done in the motion picture fifty years later
Fifty years later
Obviously some of my fellow directors and i are preoccupied with considering the world to be as one if you like that things are not separate that there are not people and then animals and then trees and then ponds
no we think there is a whole world and that this world each element in this world governs the conditions of other elements and that we can not think of a fly without thinking of the bird that will eat the fly
so that in the end the setting is essentially pantheistic in your eyes
i think so
of course it is a question of temperament
it is extremely difficult for me not to see divinities all around me and not to imagine that nature is alive and that the trees are speaking to me
that is a bit pretentious because the trees are much more clever than i am much wiser but i do try to listen to them and learn their lessons
Leave my kids alone
Why
you are teaching them bad habits
Laurent your thumb
Alice blow your nose
Luc do not scratch yourself
Philippe stop biting your nails
Alice is old enough to blow her own nose
Go on blow
Say are those your kids or mine
they are yours
Come on
Help me hang these sheets
and you go on and play
and leave Nnette alone or else i will get angry
Listen to your mother
after if you are nice and clean we will play cops and robbers
hi Titine
hi Nnette
here
is that all
what were you expecting
the jackpot
he loves to make a racket with his motorbike
Catherine do you remember when we met for the first time
it is something i will remember all my life
where
it was at the Cinematheque on the rue d'Ulm
you were presenting Flaherty's Louisiana Story
and there was a little cocktail party and i saw you there
i was so shy i had just arrived from Marseilles and still had an accent
i was a redhead and i had a big hat on my head
a fur hat
Incredible
that is right a white fur hat
i came up to you
a friend introduced us and you said
I'd like some pictures of this little lady
the first thing that surprised me was that this southerner who was such a typical southerner was wearing a Russian fur cap
i said to myself
that is really strange something's out of place
so i looked again and i found
and by the way the impression i had could perhaps be helpful to you in certain roles
i found that you had a 1900s look to you
you made me think of a character one who was magnificently acted by Simone Simon in fact in one of my films the character of Sverine in the Human Beast
you made me think of Sverine
i said to myself Well here is a Sverine
and i like Sverine very much and i liked you in turn
that is fantastic
i did not know all that was going to happen to me
i simply know that i turned red and
i was shy i hid in a corner i backed up as much as i could and i did not see Louisiana Story
that was just the beginning
after that we worked together
yes
you wanted to do a test for Cordelier
a little test that i did not keep
i did not leave it in the film it was not very good but it did allow me to get to know you
and after that we rehearsed Picnic on the Grass together using a method that i am entirely against now
you remember my method at the time describe it
it amazed me
i was not at all familiar with television as i had never done any
we rehearsed with markers you had drawn some things on the ground
that is i had drawn with a piece of chalk the outline of the exterior set in which we were going to shoot so that the actors could get used to the distances
that is something I'd no longer do
we are young at any age
i was a baby then now i am young
yes but it allowed me to get used to television methods and afterward thanks to you i was no longer surprised
when i worked on the Colettes i knew where i was
that is it that is exactly why i do not like this method
i do not like it
it is practical it allows you to shoot with a certain security it permits you to avoid spending too much money to avoid going over schedule to shoot the number of shots planned for the day but in my opinion it kills one extremely important thing which is the actor's surprise when faced with the set and in my opinion this surprise is very interesting
i think that the actor must assimilate the set himself and not through a director who draws some chalk lines on the ground
if i were a dictator
let's pray that i never will be because i would not like it but if i were a dictator i would start by forbidding all pieces of chalk on stages and on sets because theater directors work only with chalk now they mark the spots where the actors' feet should go
i hate that
i think that actors must have freedom of movement
what is really important is to bring to life a certain character
it is the marriage of Nnette and Catherine
and the rest is a joke it is not important
but it allows you to work more quickly
it allows you to work more quickly but i am no longer a partisan of working quickly
not really
i have learned a great deal since while i was not shooting
i have filmed very little since and i have learned a great deal
i have learned for example that the hurdles of the film are useful
Say you have a shot that is difficult to light
it takes a long time and the actress's mind goes blank because the lights are so hard to take but during this seemingly wasted time she plunges into a world that allows her to become more familiar with her character
i think that inconveniences wind up being advantages
i am convinced of that
i think that most of all you get into a climate you swim in this climate because anything outside it is a matter of indifference
it disappears
you are surrounded by lights by familiar faces
that is why it is very important that no visitors be on the set not even friends if they are not part of the film
the face of an electrician you know is the face of a friend it is part of the world to which you temporarily belong whereas even the face of your mother who has come to visit is extremely dangerous
so next time no visitors
we will get rid of them all
should not the viewer be added to the list of people who are active in the birth of a film
Obviously
it is impossible to have a work of art without the spectator's participation without his collaboration
a film must be completed by the audience
that is why absolute precision is dangerous
on the other hand however intentional imprecision is dangerous as well
i think that one of the ingredients for success is to have a lot to say to have too much to say so that you do say it but you do not say it all
there are certain parts that you cannot manage to formulate that you forget or for which you simply can not find the words the terms the camera movements the lighting or the right expressions for the actor to express it
the audience compensates for it
what is interesting is that each person in the audience each viewer compensates in his own manner
the truth is that a film is as many films as it has viewers
if there are a thousand viewers you have a thousand films if it is a good film
if it is not a good film it is precise and it is the same film for each viewer
we could therefore define the success of a work by the many interpretations it allows for
i think so
you see the big mistake in commercial filmmaking right now is the search for perfection
often people say to me oh producers are disgraceful people disgusting people they think only of money they think only of how much they will make they think only of what is financially successful
it is not true
i claim that producers are the most disinterested people in the world they are people who really love film
my only criticism of them is that they want to make good films which in my opinion is completely ridiculous
it is not a matter of making good films it is a matter of bringing in a little piece of humanity
it is a matter of opening a little door onto what we think we have discovered about the human mind or about a situation a situation that leads us to characters
it is a matter of getting to know people and that is all
when producers seek technical perfection as they often do with the earnest desire of producing a work of art
i think they are making a huge mistake
what happens is that these absolutely perfect products these products to which nothing can be added wind up being boring and audiences wind up getting tired of films because they have been shown too much perfection
Day after day
Night after night
Always the same hopelessness
Always waiting
Hurry up Natasha you lazy girl
there is work upstairs
Why are not you in school
Resting Pepel
yes i am
Lucky you with nothing to do
what business is it of yours
Beat it
Watch how you speak to me
you forget i am the boss around here
you owe me respect
Why take that tone with your fellow man
have you got my money
what money
for the watch
what watch my son
do not play games with me
Yesterday you promised me 10 rubles for a watch
you gave me three
you owe me seven
Hand it over
Stop blinking like an old owl
do not get mad
that watch was
Stolen
you knew that yesterday
i do not buy stolen goods
no kidding holy man
Hurry up and give me my money
all in good time Pepel
what crude people
Well well
so it is all gone
Your house clothes cognac
Gone even the memory
so you will stay here
yes
it is not so bad
You'd leave if it was
that is another story
Come on i will find you a bed
Good old baron
here is a new lodger
who is he
Just passing through
for the night or longer
we will see
you have any papers
Lots but they are all worthless
you have any money
i will vouch for him
he is a friend
Come on
the audience's collaboration is even a necessity now because there are many people whose lives are not much fun
These are people who live in big cement apartment houses and every morning they go to an office or to a factory and they do the same thing make the same motions
they drive their cars on highways where they stop and start
they stop for the red light and they start at the green
it is rather disappointing is not it
other periods had their disadvantages as well
i am talking about the disadvantages of our times without suggesting that they are better or worse
but our period has its disadvantages
one of the disadvantages is solitude
everything leads to solitude and in addition people want solitude they think solitude is good
someone who tells you they bought a house in the country says
i have a marvelous house
Just imagine there is not a soul around me not even a mouse only fields nothing
they do not realize that human beings are the interesting part of life
what is interesting is meeting people not meeting trees
Trees are magnificent if they exist in relation to a human being but i could not care less about trees by themselves
in any case they do not interest me
they excite me as soon as they bring me closer to the people who planted them to the people who created the civilization around them or when they bring me closer to the people in my area to emotions i have felt when they bring memories to mind but trees by themselves do not interest me
so one of the ways of fighting against modern boredom is art
Art is a little bridge that you erect
the director of a film if he has a little talent sometimes succeeds in creating a little bridge between the screen and the audience and then we are all together and we create together we build the film together
the audience makes this contribution and this contribution is very important
Please do not be angry with me
if i get violent it is because i love you
Give me a kiss
never again you hear
Whenever i look up at your face it makes me afraid
i see you back in the train
what you told Lantier was right
i haven't gotten over it
i will never get over it
i can not forget it either
but if we do not life will become unbearable for the two of us here in this place
i am going out
where
the caf
i am meeting Cauche and the others
if they are going to the cafe why should not i
Please forgive me Severine
what was the matter with Roubaud
oh he is just been a little jumpy lately
he is not hurting you is he
i do not think you should stay here
Why not come with me
i love you
you love me
yes
i have loved you for some time now
Why do not you come with me
you love me
yes
this is terrible
what do you mean
you must not
Why not
you must not
but why not
i am incapable of loving anyone
are you saying you could never love me
Jacques i love you as much as i am able to love anyone
do not be angry
my life hasn't been a happy one
my childhood was so horrible
i am still afraid sometimes
it is not a lover i need but a good friend who i could talk to about my troubles my disappointments my hopes
i need trust and tenderness and i can give them in return
but not love
you must not ask for that
i understand Severine
Perhaps it is better this way
i could tell you a few things as well
it is better this way
we will just be good friends
you said in Cahiers du cinema that films are not eternal that reels of film deteriorate so where does the importance of this art lie since one hundred years from now there may be no more films
of course
but would you ask me where Homer's importance lies because between you and me no one has read Homer
Suppose there were six thousand of us here and we asked the question has anyone here read Homer
if the people are truthful they will say no
Homer is very important nonetheless
something strange happens with a work of art
it outlives its existence
i do not know why but it is a fact there is an indirect influence
Think about it let's be honest take any great work of art take the best painting in the Louvre
how many French people have seen it
a tiny proportion maybe one in a thousand i do not know yet its influence is obvious the influence of French works of art on French civilization
Take for example something we have all around us good architecture
after all we do still have a few prodigious houses in Paris we have a few old houses in the Marais we can see doors with sculptures columns on each side and it makes us feel happy ecstatic
but not many of us are walking around ecstatic
i believe in the end that a work of art works mysteriously
i believe a great deal in radar in life in human radar
there is a kind of radar that causes the work of art to influence people but not directly
i think that going to the Louvre and saying
Ah
i am going to look at the Mona Lisa
Ah i am looking at the Mona Lisa how beautiful
i do not think that does much for you
but if you feel the presence of the Mona Lisa and if you know
you have to hang paintings on your walls at home not so much to look at them but so that they can influence you
it is like throwing a stone
in the river into calm water and the circles even the farthest away reach you
CONCERT AND DANCE NATlONAL RAlLROAD BALLROOM
so it is all over
you won't be seeing her again
everything has to end sooner or later
you had some good times together
Love is best early on before you know each other well when you are both on your best behavior
Take me for example
i do not care for dancing but she does
so i take her out because i am a nice guy
i guess i owe it to her
her brother caught us in bed the other night
i barely had time to jump out the window in my shirt
then he slapped her around
does that make sense to you
not to me
she is his sister not his wife
what is it to him anyway
the poor kid
Look at Roubaud's wife
she looks just like a princess
not bad for the wife of a stationmaster
in the end a work of art is not made to be looked at it is made to permeate living people people in the street
Permeate you have found an excellent word
so that goes against all current practice which is to create a monument a sound and light spectacle or whatever
oh let's not talk about all that
i am completely against these things
first of all to begin with
i find the lighting of monuments to be very ugly it flattens them and you can not see the difference between a picture postcard and a monument when it is lit in this way
everything is flattened you can not see the difference between a good sculpture and a bad sculpture when they are harshly lit
of course i am against spectacular art except if it is the art of the spectacle which by definition has to be presented as a spectacle but which also acts not so much as a spectacle but as an influence
it is like the paintings that are lugged all around
they lug paintings all over the world at the risk of damaging them of seeing them slashed stolen only to show them to people who say
my God it really is beautiful
oh yes the hand is very well drawn and there is a faint expression in the eye
they do not get anything out of it they would get a lot more out of a painting painted by their neighbor or their child
you can get very good paintings just from children
Until the age of six children generally are good at painting so all you need is a drawing on the wall done by a child and you will get a lot more out of it than from a three minute stint in front of the Mona Lisa

the death of Wally Brandford famous comedian killed in an Alaskan plane crash has left Hollywood in a state of shock
this reporter talked with Wally Brandford's
long time friend and producer Mr Caryl Fergusson in his office suite atop the Beverly Hilton Hotel
Mr Fergusson informed this reporter that in the absence of living relatives funeral arrangements are being made by his staff
where is that boy with the ice
what is with the service
Well i guess i will just have to struggle along without any
Fergy are you saying that Wally did not leave us anything
Right
i gave a lot of years to end up with nothing
oh i suppose you call that little house in Malibu that Wally gave you nothing
you know what i mean
Well i do not know what you mean
Wally did give you that house in Malibu
he gave Ellen a trip to Europe every year he gave me that property in Palm Springs
Why everybody in this room was well taken care of before he ever got on that plane
OK OK
so what do we do now
we do what we have always done except we do it for somebody else
what else can we do
i will probably wind up as a public relations man for some up and coming rock'n' roll singer
and i will write jokes for a hillbilly television show
and i will produce for somebody and Ellen will write letters for some other somebody
all seems like such a terrible waste
i do not know
i have been watching this little scene here and i can not help myself
to me it has all the makings of a real melodrama
a great man passes on leaves behind him his expert staff
what is going to happen
are they going to split up
each one goes his own little ways
looks for a new subject for his respective talent or are they going to stick together and work and fight as a unit
Tune in next week
you know you sound like a man with very good questions but never any answers
Morgan it is next week
i am tuned in
on with the show
Give me a light
Maybe i can help you with another question
Suppose when you first met Wally you would have died in a plane crash
then what would have happened
i suppose he would have gotten another writer and taught him all his tricks
Very good
what about Ellen
Well the same thing i guess
you get a gold star
it is true
Wally taught me his style of handling people until i could do it as well as he could
i guess he could have taught anyone the same thing
you see
i do not have to go any further
this is the position we are in each one of us including me except that Wally's gone and we are here
what is the answer
you mean get somebody in his place
that is right
you mean get some nobody and then
Correct
Teach him everything we know
Correct
no
not what we know
Teach him everything we have learned
after all was not it Wally who taught Chic Ellen Harry myself most of what we know about this business
yes
and even you Morgan
although you directed successfully on Broadway
Wally taught you the motion picture business
of course
Teach somebody
Why it is the only thing we can do
but who
Wait a minute Caryl
Let's have an understanding as to why we are going to do this
lf it is at all feasible
are we going to do this because we are spoiled and used to a comfortable well oiled machine
or is it simply because we have been happy working as a family and we hate the thought of breaking up
Ellen you are right
you are absolutely right

oh how do you do
oh i said how do you do
Speak up son
my name's Sloan
what is yours
Stanley
it is a pleasure Handley
no it is Stanley
no
it is Sloan Manley
Mayo Sloan
he is a little hard of hearing
Mayo is known as a hit maker
he made a hit record with the Four Rats called
you Broke my Heart when you Broke my Comb
oh then he must be very smart
Art
i thought your name was Manley
he also made Rotten Romance with the Six Slobs
Well then he knows music very good
i got a natural ear for it
Well you are very grateful
Go ahead let's go out in the studio and let's get started
Hold it
Hold it
Hold it
all right here is the tempo
Let's try it once from the start
here we go
one
two
Hold it
Louie the kid's coming out
we will do it with him
are you Stanley
Well after that i am not too sure
Let's try it from the top Stanley
OK boys here is the tempo
one two
Hold it
Hold it
Louie i need more voice from the trio
one two
you think he will be all right
that is just what i was gonna ask
Just fine
all he has to do on this Teenage Dance Time show is mouth his record
he just has to mouth the record
we had no choice anyway
the record's been out one week and already it is pushing for number one spot
you sure that is the right channel
that is it Caryl
do not you see the show is on already
can not you see the kids dancing
they are moving up and down Caryl
Look kind of cute do not they
i am sorry
they were playing our tune
oh Stanley you are too much
oh yeah i like to do that
you really like the simple things do not you
oh yeah of course
the hard ones always give me trouble
Stanley i checked with the booth
yeah
and they are going to play this final dance number for the kids
and then you are on
oh i am glad
Ellen did you ever think back
i mean did you ever try to go back in your memory and think back about something that happened a long time ago
Well certainly Stanley
yeah
Especially the tender nice things
yeah
the things we wish would still prevail
but since they do not we try to bring them back by reminiscing
yeah i was gonna say that too
yeah well i do that a lot
i always do that
but sometimes they are not nice what you are reminiscing
then why do you try to remember them
oh i do not try the bad parts
i mean
i did not mean
i mean i am watching the kids dancing and hugging and it was nice to see
and i could not help but think about a night a long long time ago and with a girl that you remind me of
Well maybe it was not a good memory but it felt good talking about it anyhow
of course it was good
the sweet things and the good things are not always the things that make us better people
i think the heartaches the unpleasant things even the heavy burdens we have had placed upon us make us stronger in the long run
oh yes it is nice to have pretty memories
and our hearts are happier when pain doesn't exist
but bad is a test
lf we can carry on after a bad thing happens then we have grown up some
do not you agree
you are a nice lady

what do you think Caryl
you mean about our boy wonder

that is a gag
and i will do a lot of other gags
Tomorrow night you can
i am gonna be Ed Sullivan
i mean on Ed Sullivan
i mean i will be on his show if
Sit down kids
what is up Caryl
Well i
i realise that
Well i
i mean if you stop to consider
Just what are you trying to say
he is not trying
he is telling us that we blew it and it was a bad idea to begin with
i gotta figure out some way to handle the press
i do not
Look take my advice do not even try
i for one am leaving for the Springs in about 1 5 minutes
you what
you heard me i am leaving
Well what about Stanley
he goes on in an hour
when they see how bad our king of comedy is they will eat us up alive
We'd be out of our minds to hang around get it
you mean you are gonna let him go through with that show and whatever happens afterwards all alone
Well he has to
he signed a contract right
because he trusted us
Ellen
it won't be that bad
he will stumble through the Sullivan caper like he did in that small club and then he will silently steal away
and then he will become a bellboy again
it is that simple
it is the only way Ellen
i did send him a letter by messenger explaining
you sent him a letter
Well how nice
yes
Matter of fact i have got a copy of it right here
you made a copy
Well then why do not you read it to me
i was going to
Dear Stanley
sometimes what seems to be a great idea can go so radically wrong
that it is best to forget it
before turning back becomes impossible
Unfortunately in the case of this plan
because of your signature on a contract
you have to do the Sullivan Show
the results are so obvious to all of us that we felt it best not to be there
we wish you luck
and hope you get your old job back at the hotel
and it is signed Caryl
Harry Chic
Morgan Bruce and Ellen
Ellen
what right did you have to sign my name to that disgraceful piece of paper
oh you have got a lot of nerve when it comes to writing letters
it is too bad you do not have enough to stick by him now
Well look we know how you feel Ellen but what can we do
Well i know what i can do
i can try and get to that theatre before that messenger does
Ellen what good would that do now
what good
i can let him know that i am going to stick through it with him to the very end no matter how bad
and i can also let him know that i love him
and that is good
Fifteen minutes to air
that is fifteen minutes to air
Orchestra on stage please
Fifteen did you sa
Fifteen

Say does anybody know
oh usher man
Did you see any of my staff

Let's keep it moving
Helen
Helen
Helen
Helen
will you listen
no you listen
to the sound of these balcony tickets hitting the floor
Helen
have any of you read the trade papers this morning
you do not have to look at the trades it is in every paper
he even made the front page of the Times
a star is born
Did you see him last night
Did you
do you believe that kid
can you believe him
i tell you it was the greatest thing i ever saw in my life and the people loved it
you know what the greatest thing was
he did not use one line or one bit that we gave him
that i gave him
he just winged the whole thing and he was great
then why on earth did you ask us all to come here and send us the wire
None of us can work with him anymore after the way we walked out on him
Why did i ask you
i did not ask anybody
i was in the Springs when i got Harry's wire
Harry's wire
the only wire i got was from you
Listen if this is somebody's idea of a joke
i do not think it is very funny
Ellen did you have anything to do with this
not a thing
the wire i received was signed Caryl Fergusson and that is all i know
Well all i know is
Excuse me
i sent those telegrams
now i
i did not mean to be deceitful it is just that
Well you know i wanted to talk to all of you just once more
i am sorry Stanley i
i do not know what else we can say except
Well i
i just guess we were all a bunch of gutless wonders
i feel the same way kid
my best wishes Stan
i like you kid
may i make it unanimous
Sure
Well thank you i am
Hey wait a minute
Wait a minute
i
i think i have to clarify something here
i mean this is not a wake you know
i sent the telegrams not because this is a finish it is because it is the beginning
there is a lot of things i think we have to do
i got a lot of confidence from everything that is happened
Chic maybe we can do some new jokes with the car and the chasing dogs
we could update it a little bit you know
Caryl could you get Las Vegas for me
i mean call Jack and set a deal
Whatever you set it will be good
Bruce what about a new wardrobe like a whole Ronald Romance
Handsome i should look
we have gotta do
oh yeah and i am gonna need a new secretary Caryl
do not forget that because i am gonna need a secretary
you know you gotta have a secretary with correspondence and all that
now look here Stanley
Ellen had absolutely nothing to do with this
of course not
i wrote that letter and i signed all the names
Ellen did not even
Fine
i still say
i need a new secretary
i am entitled right
and i want a new secretary
and that is final
because no wife of mine is going to be working late at night and getting stuck in traffic jams
she is staying home taking care of the children and the laundry
Like any other
Well
they must be glad about it
when i say i have a wife that does she will
and i will also
Well do not get mad because i only was teasing
no do not get
i was
what i meant i just wanted you should
i was fooling
so you are going to need
a new secretary
Well
Really Mr Belt
Well no i was only
and i suppose that is because i will be too busy with your children
is that it
no i ain't got none
i mean
but if you'd like to gather a few together it
you wanna put a few together and we will be a good
no
I'd love to Stanley
and i love you
Well that is OK
i mean you are right
that is you win
because i love you too
but i should be the aggressor you should not be chasing because
Stanley
Stanley
Stanley
are not you overacting a little bit Miss Balman
Balin

Suspect vehicle late model grey Ford headed westbound on 7th
he is really moving
i will need an ambulance at 7th and Broadway right now
Hold it
all units watch for a late model grey Ford last seen westbound on 7th and Broadway
Hold on
are you injured

do exactly what i say
Exactly
do not move unless i say
do not make a sound unless i say
do you understand
do you understand
yes
Please do not hurt me
i am here to help you
i am Reese
Sergeant Tech Com
DN 38416 assigned to protect you
you are targeted for termination
Intercept at National and Olympic
Come in 1 L 19
this is 1 L 19
Westbound on Olympic approaching Overland
this is a mistake
i did not do anything
no but you will
it is very important that you live
this is not true
how could that man get up after you
it is not a man
a machine
a Terminator
Cyberdyne Systems model 101
a machine
Like a robot
not a robot
a cyborg
Cybernetic organism
no he was bleeding
Just a second
Get your head down
all right listen
the Terminator's an infiltration unit
Part man part machine
Underneath it is a hyper alloy combat chassis
Microprocessor controlled
Fully armored
Very tough
but outside it is living human tissue
Flesh skin hair blood
Grown for the cyborgs
what do you want from me
Pay attention
i gotta ditch this car
the 600 series had rubber skin
we spotted them easy
but these are new
they look human
Sweat bad breath everything
Very hard to spot
i had to wait till he moved on you before i could zero him
Look i am not stupid you know
they cannot make things like that yet
not yet
not for about 40 years
are you saying it is from the future
one possible future
from your point of view
i do not know tech stuff
then you are from the future too right
Right
Right
Cyborgs do not feel pain
i do
do not do that again
Just let me go
Listen and understand
that terminator is out there
it can not be bargained with
it can not be reasoned with
it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear
and it absolutely will not stop ever until you are dead
can you stop it
i do not know
with these weapons i do not know
all units grey Ford suspect vehicle found in a parking structure at 4th and Broadway
Location lower level
Suspect described as male white six feet 26 years green overcoat
last seen on
Reese
Why me
Why does it want me
there was a nuclear war
a few years from now all this this whole place everything it is gone
Just gone
there were survivors here there
Nobody even knew who started it
it was the machines Sarah
i do not understand
Defense network computers
New
Powerful
Hooked into everything
Trusted to run it all
they say it got smart
a new order of intelligence
it saw all people as a threat not just those on the other side
it decided our fate in a microsecond
Extermination
Did you see this war
no
i grew up after
in the ruins
Starving
Hiding from H Ks
H Ks
Hunter Killers
Patrol machines built in automated factories
most of us were rounded up
Put in camps for orderly disposal
this is burned in by laser scanner
some of us were kept alive to work loading bodies
the disposal units ran night and day
we were that close to going out forever
but there was one man who taught us to fight to storm the wire of the camps
to smash those metal motherfuckers into junk
he turned it around
he brought us back from the brink
his name is Connor
John Connor
Your son
Your unborn son
Drive
Reese
no Reese
no
no
they will kill you
you in the Cadillac
Let me see your hands
now
Get out of the car
Drop to your knees
Out of the car
Drop to the ground
all units PC 907
Suspect is in custody
Cancel fu her assistance
Sarah try to drink some of this
are you sure it is them
i mean maybe i should look at the bodies
they have been identified
there is no doubt
oh God
Ginger
oh kiddo
Sarah this is Doctor Silberman
hi Sarah
i want you to tell him everything Reese told you
do you feel up to that
yeah
i guess so
you are a doctor
Criminal psychologist
is Reese crazy
Well that is what we are gonna find out
so you are a soldier
Fighting for whom
with the 132nd under Perry
From'21 to'27
that is the year 2 27p
that is right
then i was assigned to Recon
this is great under John Connor
who was the enemy
a computer defense system built
Damn
Sorry
Built for SAC NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems
i see
and this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy
Killing him in effect before he is even conceived
Sort of retroactive abortion
Silberman cracks me up
he had a guy in here that burned his Afghan
he screwed it first Shut up
Why did not it kill Connor then
Why this scheme with the Terminator
it had no choice
their defense grid was smashed
We'd won
Taking out Connor then would make no difference
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence
is that when you captured the lab and found what is it
the time displacement equipment
that is right
the Terminator had already gone through
Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place
how do you get back
i can not
Nobody goes home
Nobody else comes through
it is just him and me
it is just him and me
Why did not you bring any weapons
something more advanced
do not you have ray guns
Ray guns
Show me a piece of future technology
you go naked
something about the field generated by a living organism
nothing dead will go
Why
i did not build the fucking thing
okay okay
but this cyborg if it is metal
Surrounded by living tissue
oh right
Right
this is great stuff
i could make a career out of him
See how clever this is
it doesn't require proof
most paranoid delusions are intricate but this is brilliant
Why were the other two women killed
most records were lost in the war
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's mother
her full name where she lived
they just knew the city
that Terminator was just being systematic
Let's go back to
you have heard enough
i have answered your questions now i have to see Sarah
that is not up to me
then why am i talking to you
because
who is in authority
Please
Shut up
you still do not get it do you
he will find her
that is what he does
that is all he does
you can not stop him
he will wade through you reach down her throat and pull her heart out
Doc
Let go of me
Sorry
so Reese is crazy
in technical terminology he is a loon
Sarah this is what they call body armor
our TAC guys wear these
Stop a 12 gauge round
this other individual must've been wearing one
Feel that
Go ahead
what about punching the windshield
he was probably on PCP
if he broke his hand he would not feel it for hours
there was this guy See this
here
Thank you
there is a couch
Stretch out and try to sleep
be an hour before your mom gets here from Big Bear
i can not sleep
Try
it may not look it but that couch is very comfortable
you will be perfectly safe
we got 30 cops in this building
Thank you
Good night
Good night
i am a friend of Sarah Connor
i was told she is here
could i see her
no she is making a statement
where is she
it may take a while
you want to wait there is a bench
i will be back
what the hell was that
Gunshots
is it a terrorist
Let's go
Stay here
Let's get out of here
Come on
Move it move it move it
i got him
Watch him
Automatic weapons
Come on let's go
Fire
Fire
Ed
Sarah
Reese
this way
KFLB news time 4 36
in the top story the largest law enforcement mobilization in California history is underway
Police in five southern counties are in a massive manhunt
Take this
all right let's get this off the road
you cold
Freezing
Reese you got a first name
Kyle
Kyle what is it like when you go through time
White light
Pain
it is like being born maybe
oh my God
i caught one back there
you mean you got shot
it is not bad
we gotta get you to a doctor
it is okay
Forget it
what do you mean forget it
are you crazy
Take this off
Jesus
See it passed right through the meat
this is gonna make me puke
would you just talk about something
what
i do not know
anything
Just talk
Tell me about my son
he is about my height
he has your eyes
what is he like
you trust him
he is got a strength
I'd die for John Connor
at least now i know what to name him
do not suppose you know who the father is so i won't tell him to get lost when i meet him
John never said much about him
i know he dies before the war Wait
i do not want to know
so was it John that sent you here
i volunteered
Why
it was a chance to meet the legend
Sarah Connor
who taught her son to fight organize prepare from when he was a kid
when you were in hiding before the war
you are talking about things i haven't done yet in the past tense
it is driving me crazy
are you sure you have the right person
i am sure
Come on do i look like the mother of the future
i mean am i tough
Organized
i can not even balance my checkbook
Look i did not ask for this honor and i do not want it
any of it
Your son gave me a message to give to you
Made me memorize it
Thank you for your courage through the dark years
i can not help you with what you face except to say the future is not set
you must be stronger than you imagine you can be
you must survive or i will never exist
that is all
it is a good field dressing
you like it
it is my first
Get some sleep
it will be light soon
okay
Talk to me some more
about what
Tell me about where you are from
all right
you stay down by day
but at night you can move around
you still have to be careful because the H Ks use infrared
but they are not too bright
John taught us ways to dust them
that is when the infiltrators started to appear

Well you know how your mother is
if she'd known she probably would've redecorated your entire bedroom
what is that smell
um that is an old writer's trick
Schiller believed that his body sabotaged the attention of his mind while he was writing
so he engaged his body with a simple stimulant apples to free his mind
so far all it is done for me is make me hungry for apple pie  la mode
so what have you been working on recently
my interview with James Sullivan
Senator Sullivan
Mm hmm
that is impressive
that is a big story
you know i have been meaning to ask you
Random House has been asking me who I'd like to write the introduction to Volume two of my Collected Essays

okay

Crap
oh shit
Mom
can you come here quick
no i saw it on Donahue
this woman said a UFO landed and took away her husband
a UFO
and the UFO's name was probably Jennifer or Sophia
yeah but she saw something you know and i think there are things in this world that are mysterious and unexplainable
yeah like remember when they had one calorie Tab
i was always wondering why the need for that one calorie at all
oh there you are
Ellie made the lunch

there is really nothing Minnie about me
oh do not be silly
i do not even like Christmas
oh Ellie
Ellie can help Kate with her Christmas tree
Welcome to the Minnies
now moving on to other Minnie matters
it was
it was awful
it was awful
Mmm
i guess that that world it um it just felt small to me
and uh and sometimes i felt like i was going crazy
but since my mom was so good at decorating and doing those creative things around the house
i suggested that she do something with her talent
like uh like decorate professionally
Start her own business
you are kidding
no it would be fun
Ellie this is the Minnies' busiest season
you know that
we have the Halloween festival for the kids
we have Thanksgiving a benefit for the older people and then we have to decorate all the Christmas trees in the town square

a book club
Mm hmm
i hate what Jane Austen does in this book too

the way she makes Jane the sweet and domestic one the good one
she makes her second fiddle to Elizabeth the one who is the outspoken and smart one
they do it at the college too women professors
they say oh you keep house
that is terribly interesting
yeah but i do not see
there is another book that does that
little Women
yes the writer's sister um she puts her in opposition to the other one that has babies
but what
Meg

Your mother's in a great deal of pain

Still beating
Loud and clear

Midterms
i can see why people would think that i did not care
but i just did not know what to do
my mom would have a couple of bad days and then she'd be fine

it is fine
i am sorry
Just a second

Even in the summertime you can hear
Maybe it is the air conditioners crickets or the bees
Hmm

Trick or treaters

Trick or treat
Trick or treat
Dad

Well you missed all the trick or treaters
they were so cute
Remember when Brian dressed up like a dice
and he tipped over and you would not help him up because you were so busy laughing at his little legs scrambling around in the air like a bug
Did you find your dad
his secretary said he had a late class
oh
that is too bad
you okay Ellie
uh huh
Great
Good
i love this movie
do you think about politics much
and if so what do you think about politics
you know how some of these meetings can go
some of the faculty
uh huh
you know one of the students had a little
oh
so he uh he just wanted me to call
okay
he thought you
yeah he thought you should not
he did not want you to worry
all right
Thank you Harold
it is just
yeah it is just another one of those meetings
Ellen
Ellen
Hmm
i was asking about your father
you haven't really mentioned him
was he not around that much
no he was around
um he was busy with his classes but but he managed to spend time at home
i looked at my American Express bill one January and went into ring failure
i was so opposed to name tags that once when a women slapped a gummed label over my left bosom that said hello my name is Erma
i leaned over and said now what shall we name the other one
what are you reading
Aunt Erma's Cope Book
how to Get from Monday to Friday in Twelve Days
Hey guys
Up here
shall i put it away
You'd better or else he will call the thought police
and they will come in in tweed jackets and pummel us with rolled up New York Times
Whoa
is this dissension in the ranks
should i do my reading from this tonight
no
no readings this Thanksgiving
Nobody even likes the readings
it is just gonna be us
and Jordan
Wait a minute
you are gonna buck 26 years of tradition
you are gonna take away Frost and Whitman and all those other exciting dead guys
are you feeling all right
Shut up
you are not going to believe who is downstairs with Harold
Oliver most poet laureate in our house
what is that book
oh it is mine
Ellen could you put up like some hors d'oeuvres or something for them
are they staying
yeah
Hmm
uh huh
Great
Dad
yeah
it was just supposed to be Jordan and us just family
Well i mean
they have no place else to go
Oliver is down from Harvard for a book signing tour
he is all by himself
Come on
you know your mother loves Oliver Most's work
you promised
Well i can not very well disinvite them now can i
and we could all use a little holiday cheer around here now
could not we
Get up
okay
Thank you
oh Ellen
you did this
oh Ellie
you do not have to be concerned with things like that
there is plenty of time
i have to pay my father when i get back
i do not know if i feel good about it
would you like some wine
Well you know there is plenty of time
a writer writes something
he calls his friend
he says
i am finished writing a little something and it is not very good
in fact it is terrible
the worse part about it is it is the best thing i can do
and that was Steinbeck Grapes of Wrath
Your father tells me you write literary reviews from time to time
Mm hmm
that is right
that is interesting
Like father like daughter
Tell me have you ever had the opportunity to review any of my work
um
i want to say grace now
oh good
uh no George i want to say my own grace
of course
Thank you for the world so sweet
Thank you for the food we eat
Thank you for the birds that sing
Thank you God for everything
and thank you Ellie for making such a beautiful Thanksgiving dinner
Sure
Bravo
to Chef Boyardee
Shut up
that is terrible
Well to our great surprise and delight tonight has become a night to go down in our family's history books
we have the honor to have with us Oliver most who whose work means so much to me and who was the first to encourage me with Comeback Inn
he is agreed after dinner to read to us from his new book for which i
i am very grateful
Well George i am happy to oblige but you are gonna have to remind me
what in the hell is Comeback Inn
it sounds as if i have encouraged you to invest in some sort of uh roadside motel
Honey would you pass the vegetables around
yeah
you want some carrots sweetheart
that is my novel
my novel
yeah
Well Jesus George
i am sorry
i forgot
as Thurber says with 60 staring me in the face
i have developed inflammation of the sentence structure
a definite hardening of the paragraph everything looks beautiful
Up in my blue room
Fools rush in and not to bed
i am the rich of the real dead head
Sure am gonna love you one more time
little bit of whiskey little bit of my mind
Well you do not know the things i see in here
Hey did you see my dad tonight
he just kills me
you know he doesn't say one word to me about dinner and then he just goes off to his study
Like we are servants there to serve him or something
hello
another round
what are you Janice Joplin
Take it easy on the sauce okay
no
no
i have not been out in two months
i know
i deserve another drink
i know
i deserve another drink especially since it is been like that since the beginning
do you know he doesn't do anything
he really doesn't
he doesn't do anything
i do everything
i do
i do everything
i realize that
but i think in situations like this you have to be sympathetic with people
i mean everybody has to deal with bad stuff in their own way you know
what
Whenever you guys say that people deal with stuff in their own way it means that you do not deal with it at all
we deal with it
we make the meals and we clean up the messes and we listen while you guys talk about how you are gonna deal with stuff in your own way
Well what way is that Jordan
Hmm
what way is that
what way
See
no way
and what the fuck are you looking at
Hey hey
huh
what are you doing
what are you doing
no no no
oh i am sorry
i am being rude
what is the matter with you
Well you know what i think is rude
i think it is rude
Hey stop it
i am trying to talk when little Miss Delta Delta Delta over here Stop it
Stop it
is trying to pick up on my boyfriend
Stop it
Stop it
in front of my face
Why do not you just lay off of her
Your sister's losing her mind
do you think i look invisible
i am not losing my mind
i am not losing my mind
i am just tired Jordan
i am tired
i am tired
Ellen let's go
Being my mother is very tiring
oh come on
there is nobody more different than your mother than you
Come on
Let's go
that is the stupidest thing that you have ever said
okay
Great
that is the stupidest thing you have ever said
oh God
Ellie
yeah
you all right
yeah i just have a headache
what happened to Jordan
i heard Brian go upstairs
yeah yeah
he has to go to work tomorrow so he just took the train back
Hmm
you sure you are all right
how do you do this every day all day in this house and no one notices
Doesn't that drive you crazy
but this is my family Ellie
These are the people i love
Maybe it is time for you to start thinking about going back to New York
Maybe you should go back to the city to your work and your writing and all those things that you like to do
that is what is important sweetie
you know we can get somebody to help out around here
that is not
but you did a great job tonight
you should be proud of yourself
Night night sweetheart

Good night sir
Taxi
Hey do not i know you

Ellen Gulden

i remember Peeved Eves
Well it is nice to see you
yeah yeah
Nice to see you too
got to get to J F K in time for the last commuter shuttle
it is my daughter's birthday today
if you are going to J F K i can give you a lift
i moved to Seattle a couple of months ago to get away from all the cameras my ex wife and my ex kids
yeah you know i think i saw something about that on television
how horrible
you know what is strange
one minute you are in school and the next minute you look up Mm hmm and your life's all turned around and screwed up
yes i know
yeah
you try and you try to get ahead
Somewhere in it all you just
you lose yourself
and you never know when it is gonna come
Mm hmm
Comes out of nowhere
Bang
it is just
Your life is a disaster
yep
oh i just hope i can make it up to my wife and kids
you know that is all that counts
that is all that counts
yeah you are right
they are the ones who love you
that is what counts
i am reading Mom
and baby cows are calves
you are right
G a Tweedy here
Leave a message after the noise
Mr Tweedy it is Ellen
uh
Listen i waited for Sullivan outside of his hotel and uh
Well he never showed
Damn
here we go
they are several reasons why i asked you here today one of which
hi John
Peter
George
one of which is to ask you
why you were so hostile with me at Thanksgiving
i know this is not the best situation for any of us
but i am trying Ellen
i am trying to be patient
i have some questions that I'd like to discuss with you
i do not think i want to talk about the interview
i do
okay Ellen
how come Mom waited so long
Why did not she go to the doctor sooner
what are you talking about
was it because you did not want your world disrupted
because you needed her to keep your life running smoothly
Like you need me now
what the hell are you doing
because she can not do it all
Well do you have any idea what it takes to keep your life running so smoothly
Ellen have you lost your mind
Maybe
Keep your voice down
this is inappropriate
it is appropriate
everything at our house has changed but you do not know about it
because you are behaving as though life goes on as usual
Well life as we know it is done
this is real life
Fuck fiction
less is not more
you have taken sabbaticals for the great American novel
Why not one for Mom
Why won't you participate in the most important thing that has happened in your life
she needs you
Why is it always more important for you to hear what some writer has to say than me
and Brian
Hey
Hey what other tricks do you use besides your fucking apples to get your writing juices flowing Dad
Cheating on Mom is that one
i will hire a full time nurse
you are going back to New York
what other tricks
several people have mentioned a heated argument that you had with your father outside the campus cafe
it was shortly after Thanksgiving
do you recall the incident
uh huh
yeah i remember
it was a stressful time and there was a lot to do and it was hard
so there was no problem between you and your father
no
or your father and your mother
my mother and my father
of course not
it was a busy time
i mean i was a full fledged Minnie
i remember we were making the uh ornaments the craft ornaments with the feathers and the sequins for my mother's Christmas tree in the square
and uh i would climb up the ladder and she would tell me where to put them
it was a lot of fun
yeah it is really not that bad
yeah it is okay
you know i always used to try to get you to go see Santa
for years and years
and then when you were 8 years old you got in line and you went to the very front pulled his beard off
Pulled his beard off and yelled Fraud
Your dad was so proud of you
Well guess what
i am getting in the line
yes
oh now you want to
uh huh
Good girl
Go on
be good
Ellen Gulden

Answer the phone Dad
Ellen
Mom's in the hospital
the cancer has progressed much more quickly than we had expected
i am sorry but i think it is best to stop the chemotherapy
uh you know what
um i am not ready to stop the chemotherapy
i am afraid there is no more we can do
we all need now to focus on helping her through this next part
i am putting her on morphine
you will need to give her one tablet twice a day for the pain
they should not be chewed or crushed because they might become toxic
i am sorry
i will get you the prescription

Ellen
Please
would not it be a lot easier if we could just admit to our failures the things that we fucked up on
Ellen would you not use that word in the house please
Sorry
Used the F word
Failure is not allowed in the Gulden house
you know maybe maybe we should break tradition this year
and since i have got a hell of a good list of failures i will start

Come on
Come on
i do not think so either
I'd like to

Happy New Year
i failed my English class last semester
i am on academic probation and i got kicked off the tennis team
Happy New Year
Jesus Christ Brian

Mom i got a job at the Cambridge Racquet Club
oh
and i do not wanna go back to school
you got a job
that is great
is not it
Ten nine eight seven
you like it
yeah i love it
that is wonderful
that is what you should do then six five four three
Good God you only live once two one and we are into 1988
the holidays seemed to take a lot out of my mother
it was right after New Year's when her health really started to decline
and this guy in my class was going on and on about how selfish she was and how of course she would leave
so my professor who is a woman said
Anna Karenina would have left her husband for her lover
but would never have left her son
and had Tolstoy been a woman he would've understood that
what do you think of that
i haven't been reading Anna Karenina
no more whipping
that is enough
Just drain the cherries
you have two hours till Brian leaves
you know i wanna have his pie ready for him when he goes
i think the crust is probably ready too
you better check that
it should probably bake a little longer but i can
i can not read anything anyway
my eyesight's gone like an old lady
Let me see
uh i do not think
Let me see
Let me
Goddamn it
i hate this stupid chair
i hate it
i hate it
i wish i could just roll it down the street right through Evelyn Best's front window
she pet me like a cat at Christmas
Did you see that
do not do not do that
Just leave it
Get Get another pie plate
there is another one over in the left hand cubby
have time to make another
Left left hand cubby
no actually
i put them in here
and you know Mom there is handicap access everywhere
i am not handicapped
oh God i am not
what are you doing
i am not an invalid
Stop that
i am not
i am not
it is my house you know
you can not tell me what to do
i am still a mother
Still a mother here
Mom i know that
hello
Ellen i am going to be working late tonight
Sorry i did not make it home for supper
Mm hmm
i will get there as soon as i can
yeah i am sure you will Dad
who was that
it was your husband
Seems he is working late again
Well it is a tough job running that whole department
not that tough
Whatever you are doing stop and come here
Right now
yeah
what has happened
between you and your father
what do you mean
you have been so angry at him ever since you came home
i do not know
i mean there is some stuff that
i mean it doesn't have anything to do with you
Pretty soon he is all you will have you know
Please Mom stop
no
you stop
he is gonna need you
you are gonna need each other
my God you used to be so close
what
the two of you are so alike
Please do not say that
Why
because he is not perfect
because he is not the man you thought he was
no i
no i can not
i can not talk about this with you
Come back here
Come on
i want you to sit down here
i can not
i want
i want to talk to you
you sit there
now you listen to me because i am only going to say this once and i probably should not say it at all
there is nothing that you know about your father that i do not know
nothing
and understand better
okay
you make concessions when you are married a long time that you do not believe you will make when you are beginning
when you are young you say oh i will never tolerate this or that or the other thing
but time goes by darling
and when you have slept together a thousand nights and you have smelled like spit up from the babies when they are sick and you have seen your body droop and get soft and some nights you just think oh God i am not gonna put up with it another minute
but you wake up in the next morning and the kitchen smells like coffee and the kids have their hair brushed all by themselves and you look at your husband and no he is not the person you thought he was
but he is your life
and the kids and the house and everything that you do is built around him
and that is your life
that is your history too
and if you take him out that is like cutting his face out of all the pictures
it just makes a big hole and it ruins everything
you can be hard Ellen
and you can be very judgmental
and with those two things alone you are gonna make such a mess out of your life you would not believe and i wanna be able to tell you these things in ten years
and when i think how most of what you learned so far came from your dad
it just hurts my heart to think how little
no
no
i have gotten done
Mom do not um
yes yes
Just let's not talk about that
can we
i wanna talk
you let me talk
now look
Let me talk
you are dad won't let me talk because he says i will upset myself
and you won't let me talk
oh Mom please do not talk
Brian's the only one that let's me talk
he is never here
i wanna talk before i die
i do
i wanna be able to say the things
i wanna say the deep thoughts without you shushing me
okay
okay
what because what i say hurts you
oh Mom
Tired of being shushed
what do you wanna say
i already said everything i wanna say
Except i am sad
Why
i am sad that i won't be able to plan your wedding
so promise me that you won't have a ring bearer or a flower girl because those kids always just misbehave and then they distract from the bride
and do not invite too many people
Well you know i might not even get married so
Whatever
if i knew that you would be happy i would close my eyes now
i would
it is so much easier to be happy my love
it is so much easier to choose to love the things that you have
and you have so much instead of always yearning for what you are missing or what it is that you are imagining you are missing
it is so much more peaceful
Thank you
that is very nice
you are you are too kind
Stay that way
you know what it is
i found out today it takes six months
what time is it
i can not see the clock
what time is it
it is 11 35
uh uh
Did Harold call yet
Ellie i need you to go get your father and bring him home
where
can i get another beer
okay
yeah
Dad
Tsk
who is that
Tsk
you weren't supposed to see this
you should not have uh
i uh
i
he did not uh
i mean he did not even remember my book

no you have to go deeper than that

Four

uh huh
and then four inches apart so that the roots do not tangle and they will just look prettier
what are these plants
Daffodils
These are daffodils
yeahto the students of the Whitwell Middle School
i recently learned from a friend about your paper clip project
i was so moved by the story that i found myself in tears
you have embarked on a journey that begins in the brain but ends in the heart
Six million Jews will never again dance love sing or learn but the souls of six million Jews will be honored remembered and treasured because of your little school in Whitwell Tennessee and the tolerance and love that live there
my name is Linda Hooper
i have lived here in Whitwell Tennessee all my life and i have been the Principal of the middle school for nine years
a lot of people have said that our little town is an unlikely place for what happened
i guess i can understand that
Probably most people if they drove into Whitwell would not be terribly impressed
it is a very rural town about 24 miles northwest of Chattanooga
it is got just two traffic lights
several gas stations and a couple of restaurants
Whitwell used to be a coal mining community and then about 30 years ago we had a really bad accident and the coal mining industry just went bust
so now we are what is called a depressed community
but let me tell you something we are not depressed we are poor we are extremely poor
but let me tell you about our children
we have wonderful children
they are respectful they are thoughtful they are caring but they are pretty much homogenous
we are a community of 1600 people however we really have no diversity
there are no Jewish people no Catholics and in our school we have only five black kids and one Hispanic child
we are all alike
and when we come up to someone who is not like us we do not have a clue
so in 1998 we began an adventure
it was no great mission
it was a need our need
we were looking to do a project that would involve tolerance and diversity
so Miss Hooper sent me to a conference in Chattanooga and i went to this conference and went to many many classes to try to find a project that would fit our need
so he came back to me and he said
you know if we studied about the Holocaust think about all of the things we could learn
we could surely learn about evil
and we would definitely learn about a culture that was totally different from our own
and so i went and asked Sandra Roberts who is the 8th grade Language Arts teacher if she would like to help
when i heard about the project i was so excited
i could not say yes quick enough
we sat down and we decided that our goal was to teach children what happens when intolerance reigns and when prejudice goes unchecked
so that is what we set out to do to teach our children that not everybody is white and Protestant and doesn't live in a rural community where they are very protected and loved and cared for
that is all we wanted to do just a nice simple thing
the important thing is the lessons that you are going to learn from this project
how important it is to treat everybody exactly like you want to be treated
Let's talk a little bit about what is going to happen today
the first year which was in'98 i believe there was just the Holocaust project
the teachers did not know a lot but they were trying to teach the kids what they did know
they read books and they watched video clips saw pictures
and they just tried their best to do what they can
but i want to remind you before we start that what we are going to cover in this project is very very graphic
of course one of the first things that the kids had to learn and one of the hardest things for them to comprehend was that Hitler murdered 6 million Jewish people
the idea for the paper clips came when a student said
what is 6 million
i have never seen 6 million
Miss Hooper's like Well neither have l
lf you can find something to collect we will try it
so the students began doing some research on the lnternet and they discovered that the paper clip was invented in Norway
i never knew that
and they also learned that the Norwegians used the paper clip as a symbol during the Holocaust
Back in the 1940s Norwegians wore paper clips on their collar to represent the people who were in the Holocaust at that time
the Jews had to wear stars telling people that they were Jews so the Norwegians wore the paper clip to represent what the wrongdoing was
because if they spoke out about it they would probably get killed or put in a concentration camp
and they came and they said
can we write some letters to some people we know
and to some other schools and to some famous people and see if they will send us some paper clips
Miss Hooper said Sure
so we began sending letters out
we have some from Tom Hanks and from Bill Cosby and from former President Bush and former President Clinton and President Bush
Dear Students
Celebrities do not always read their fan mail
as they think it is time consuming
and though i too am guilty of not reading everything that crosses my desk
i was certainly glad that i read yours
i have a very difficult time explaining to any of my seven grandchildren
what the Holocaust was all about
i am a Jew
the whole depravity of what happened in the concentration camps
really struck home when i saw pictures
of the atrocities perpetrated on the Jewish people
those pictures are still very much alive in my memories
i am sending you one paper clip
it is my paper clip
ln the future i will remember your project
with every paper clip i come in contact with
as it will be a symbol of what you students are trying to accomplish
i am moved by your endeavors
Bless you
Tom Bosley
i mean if this is a middle school we are talking about 8th graders i guess
Propaganda has absolutely nothing to do with the truth
and the stimulation that they are getting from their teachers is really everyone there should be commended for what they have done
when i came in here i did not really know a lot about it so it just felt good to be a part of something big and learn more about the Holocaust
every year the incoming 8th graders pick up where last year's left off
one of the really motivating things for David and me is seeing the thoughtfulness each new group brings to the project
Terri Lynn sitting there all nice and still
Why did you want to be a part of this
because i know that your afternoons are very full with cheerleading and other things that you do in your life and this is going to take a huge commitment
i wanted to do this because i think that this would help everybody stop and make sure that they know somebody before they start thinking and saying and i know that i do that and i think this group would really help me
Very good
when i started this project the person i was is not the person i am now
it is what you do with that charisma
i was a new teacher still trying to further her career and figure out my teaching styles and what worked best for me not necessarily what worked best for the children
i think you get so engrossed in what can you do to further your career and it becomes about you
Rumors
we all know what they are
we all probably have been subject to one or two in our life
does that make a difference in they way people think about you and think about me
oh yeah it does
when the project first began i was very prejudiced in many areas and was very quick to judge all races
i was the typical Southern person quick to judge and quick to stereotype
as a teacher i guess I'd listened to what everyone had said about kids that age and pretty much had stereotyped children you know in my classes
i would not take input from them
i would tell them what i wanted them to know and that was it
you are going to come up with some really cool posters
These children really wanted to understand the magnitude of the Holocaust
that is why the second group in the Fall of 1999 added the Paper Clip project to their weekly meetings
and with letters and paper clips coming in it seemed to be catching on
we first got a shipment of 100 000 paper clips
they were very excited and they thought they were off to a booming start
we received that in one large shipment from a gentleman in California a jewelry designer
and he called and he was all excited so for a couple of weeks there we were real excited
oh we got 100 000 this is going very quickly
8 830
and then we got into a huge lull where we would go weeks and receive two letters
and it is really hard to keep your optimism up your enthusiasm up and to keep up the enthusiasm of 27 kids
and we were just fiddling with some numbers trying to determine how long it was going to take us to get to 6 million at the current rate
and it was gonna take us 10 years and we just both shook our heads
we knew we did not have that much in us
Sandy and i sat and looked at each other and we said Well if we can collect
1 5 million for the children that were killed that you know
we will probably be doing pretty good
Towards the end of 1999 i guess the project could have gone either way
but no one was ready to give up on it just yet
Fortunately that is when Peter and Dagmar Schroeder came in
Alcohol how is it called
oh moonshining
Moonshining
yeah
oh gosh
how do you describe Peter and Dagmar Schroeder
it is only a beginning now
they contacted us in October of' 99
and the letter read their friend who was a 94 year old Holocaust survivor named Lena Gitter had found our project on the lnternet and she said this is your assignment
we both are journalists and we are here in the United States for 20 years
we are White House correspondents
yes Whitwell High
and on the side we try to get a feel for this country
ls this where they have the football game
yeah there
Go Tigers Go Tigers
as journalists you always have this negative stuff you write about
and then if you are getting older like us then it is the danger that you get cynical
and that you do not believe in good stuff anymore
ln the beginning there was not much of paper clips
they just have started to collect them
we saw then OK we have to help the kids and that we can do that
and the Germans should be involved
and we were talking to some people at the school and we asked can we come over
can we visit you
so and they said Sure
Maybe it was not only an experience for us it was an experience for the children too
because the children obviously had no idea what Germans looked like
they asked their teacher how do Germans look like
are they different from us
and then we came over and later they told us you look quite normal
we lost our professionality right away when we saw the kids
how can you be be professional when strange kids of 13 or 14 or 15 years old you have never seen in your life hug you and greet you like an old friend
you can not
little Tiger
you are number one
Give me five
could you do that
that is a little bit hard
they came they saw they wrote
they went back to Washington
they sent Dita Smith with theiWashington Post l to our school
i did a little research on the town and the area and realized that Dayton Tennessee is only about 30 or 40 miles to the north where the famous Monkey Trial took place otherwise known as the Scopes Trial where a teacher was tried for teaching Darwinian theories rather than Christian theory of Creationism
the other historical fact that i discovered when i was in Whitwell was that the Ku Klux Klan was founded only about 100 miles away in Pulaski
Maybe when i got to Whitwell i was a little bit prejudiced myself
i expected a town that was close minded very Christian very fundamentalist but i realized that that in itself was my prejudice not their prejudice
after i went to Whitwell i wrote my story and it appeared on Passover Day
from NBC News World Headquarters in New York this is NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw
the Holocaust
the cold calculated extermination of millions of Jews
a great evil that must never be forgotten
from a corner of Tennessee tonight perhaps this generation is teaching us
Well it really started getting big whenever like theiWashington iPost came down and then NBC came and then people just started the paper clips just started coming in by the millions
1 1 390
before theiWashington Post l came we probably had 150 000 paper clips
Thirty
Thirty one
Thirty two
over a period of six weeks we ended up with 24 million paper clips
and we counted them all
the grannies counted them
the aunts counted them
it is heavy so be careful
Everybody was counting
we checked in over 24 million paper clips and about 25 000 pieces of mail
at first when it went from maybe a tub or so which our regular mail carrier would take in his car every day it got to the point where we had hampers full and he could not load those hampers with the rest of his mail
so we had to call the middle school and inform them
Something's going on over here
lnstead of us delivering your mail you have to come to us to pick it up
got something for you here from Germany this suitcase right here
that came in this morning
Looks old too
yeah it does looks vintage doesn't it
i see a paper clip hanging out the back
there it is right there
that is wonderful i can not wait to get in that
Thanks
i appreciate it
Alright man we will see you later
have a good day
you too
OK
it is sorted in two different crates
Alabama through Montana and then Nebraska through Wyoming
Foreign mail is all held in a separate crate
they take every letter out
they empty the paper clips out
Once you get it sorted then you sort it again by individual states
and then they will grab a bundle go pull the log where they hand record every address
and they love the stamps
they will scrape the stamps off the envelopes and keep them because they come from Spain and Germany and New Zealand and England
every piece of paper regardless of size is kept
it is put in a plastic sleeve and stored in a notebook
we are averaging filling up a three inch binder every two days
there was a time when we were just flooded with paper clips and i began i to think my word what have i unleashed here you know
it is like you are in a flood and you are trying to stop it and yet you do not want it to stop because coming with the flood are all these important lessons
it is in German
they are all addressed to Anne
this is Anne Frank
this is awesome
they have written little things to Anne Frank
Somebody is interested enough in what we are doing to take this kind of time
i think it is amazing enough that they even know about it
you know
there are people in Chattanooga Tennessee who do not know where Whitwell Tennessee is
that is absolutely true
that is true
most people are good you know like Anne Frank said in her diary
you know people at heart are good
and when they see something like this happening that is good they want to be a part of it
you know the majority of people want to see things get better and they want to see children in a good light instead of in a bad light
this class in Germany has gotten a suitcase and they have packed it with messages
Basically they are all kind of asking for forgiveness from Anne Frank
now i think everybody in here has either seen or readiThe iDiary of Anne Frank
the gist of most of the messages is what this translation says
Dear Anne
you were brave and courageous
i think it is not good what Hitler did to the Jews
Regardless of who we are or what we are people are people
i believe people from the North and the West
i believe when they look at children in the South they think Dumb little redneck children
they are stereotyped and that is what we are trying to teach in this project
you can not stereotype anyone because you yourself are stereotyped
i am stereotyped because i live in the South
and you know i look at people that live in the North and i have a bad habit of doing it i stereotype them
and that is what we are trying to do is break those stereotypes
Listen to this letter
Shalom
i read on the lnternet about your assignment
and was very moved by the idea of collecting 6 million paper clips
in the memory of the 6 million
i look forward to seeing pictures of the completed project
the attached paper clip is in memory of a friend of my grandfather whose name is forgotten and grave unknown
i think that it is beautiful that they do not know his name and they do not know where his grave is and but i think it is good that they are sending a paper clip in remembrance of him
Reading the letters it is like you get to know people that are not here anymore
and i am thinking about all the people one by one that they each had families and they each were brothers or sisters and they were daughters and sons
i think for our children it was like an ice water bath when the letters began to come
as one of the kids said to me
do you realize that there are people in this world who never knew their grandparents
i do not think it had ever occurred to them that there were people in this world who had nobody to care about them and who did not have families
Dear Students
i am a daughter of two Holocaust survivors
i am so proud of what you are doing
in memory of all who perished during the Holocaust
my parents Kalmon and Louisa Gluck survived many horrors
during their internment under the Nazi regime
many members of both my mother's and father's families died at the camps
i have enclosed 14 paper clips for four grandparents a brother
seven aunts and uncles and two cousins
i wish you the best of luck on your wonderful project
Sincerely Mrs Sheila Gluck Levine
i grew up a child who had no grandparents when others had them
all i wanted was people
i wanted them and i never had them
ln front of me i have a prayer book that my father took through the camps with him
it was given to him by a man who was being gassed and the man asked him if he survived the camps that he should take it with him
and this is something that has survived since my father was liberated in 1945 and has been in our family
when my father passed away everyone got to feel where my father held this prayer book and how tightly it must have been held
i thank you so much for giving another way to say
i remember him i remember my mother
the times in the camps and i also remember those we lost
Thank you
Comes along the Spring of 2001 the Greater Five Towns Holocaust Survivor Group in New York called us and it seems that somehow they'd heard about the project
and they wanted to know if they could come to Whitwell and share their survivor stories with our children
and the evening before they spoke to the children at the school they were invited to the first United Methodist Church for the whole town to meet them
they do not know what Whitwell is and you know they are coming from this huge urban area and they are a little self conscious or nervous about it
you do not need to be nervous here
we are just home folk
and we are just glad to have them here
my name is Joe
i am a survivor
i was in Auschwitz for three years
i have got a number the number is 1 24 105
and i am glad that i can come and talk to you nice people
Thank you
i want to remind our members here that our guests should be the first ones to go through the line tonight and let's have a moment of blessing together
our Father we thank you especially for our guests this evening
we ask your special special blessings on this food
Good evening
Wherever hatred and prejudice will it will find a wedge and a way into our lives
but because of what these young people are doing we are understanding that there is another way and that is the way of love and we can reach out and embrace all people
first thing i want to say i wish the whole world was like you are
i was born in Poland
my name is Bernard lgielski
when the first survivor came i think is when it really hit home what we were teaching
we as Jews were singled out put in a ghetto had to wear a star
and they spoke and gave us a real life face to a story
i said when i stood in Auschwitz and i have seen that big chimney smoking day and night
and we did not really understand until that point that what we were teaching you know was not just book learning
it was this had actually happened and this person lived through it
and instead of being afraid shielding your children prepare prepare them for the real world
yes there are not nice things out there but if they will be prepared they will be able to do the right thing
Thank you
Future generations will have to learn about the Holocaust from the textbooks
we are the eye witnesses that can to a certain degree tell you what took place
i was born in a small town in Poland
the one who stood out for me was Sam
he was like a grandfather a great grandfather
he just when he he'd look at you and he'd just make you feel all warm and loving inside toward him
i was with my brother
my brother was three years older than i am
but i had no idea
when they first arrived to Auschwitz
Sam and his brother and his mother and his little brother met up with the Doctor Mengele
he was the one who chose left or right
and he sent his mother and little brother left and he sent Sam and his brother right
and so Sam did not know what had happened
and after they had went through the showers
Sam found a guard and asked him
and i asked him i said Please tell me
we arrived last night
and i arrived with my mother and my brother
where are they
what happened to them
and that man shows me smoke coming out from a chimney
i did not understand what that means
until i found out that that chimney's from a crematorium
i was thinking what it would have been like if that was me in his place and my family and my brothers and my mom and i was just thinking how horrible that would have been
and i will never know what he went through
and i only pray to God that my brother should not have been sent to such a place because he would not survive
to actually see someone who had been through the things that i read about that was really hard
but i just as a mother i kept trying to imagine what that would be like to have my kids taken away from me like that or i mean just not to know where they were
i think that struck me about as hard as anything
i will tell you one thing
everyone survivor got a story
there is not enough paper in the whole world and not enough pens to write down what these survivors went through
Thank you
this is a loving community
and i look at it as i mean there is no place in the world that this would have been any more appropriate to start because this Holocaust project is a project about love and tolerance and what better place to start than Whitwell Tennessee
Please stand for the National Anthem
i pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all
this is our monument of shoes
it commemorates the Jews that are in some of the death camps
the morning after the survivors spoke at the first United Methodist Church they came to our school because they wanted to see first hand what the children were doing with this project and have a special time with these students
it is important to me to tell these stories because there are people in the world which are denying that it ever took place
ln order to annihilate us and erase any trace of whatever happened at least that was their intentions we were put on a dead march and usually we marched during the night mostly so we would not be visible to the general public
most of us did not make it
the Americans they showed themselves on the horizon and i ran out of camp and i was hiding so i spent the night over there and i would not dare go out and i waited until the next day
i had to risk it and i went out
the Americans were there
and i was a free person to do what i
but i am still here
that is the main thing
i want you all to know i came here to the United States in 1948 and i have been the happiest ever
i want you to know happiness makes me cry more than anything else
i never have thought about it this way before but after i heard his speech and how emotional he got it really touched me
i just can not imagine just one day being at home and the next day being shipped off to a concentration camp and being tortured like that
it just makes no sense why people in the world let that happen
it made me realize the next time i say the Pledge of Allegiance
i am going to think of how glad i am that it is a free country and i had the right to do what i feel and say what i say and i just being much more respectful to it
when i was finished i was they embraced me and hugged me and kissed me
they could not and they never heard these so some of them cried even
because they never heard stories like this here and they were never in contact with people that experienced it
to me they are my heroes because they have been through everything
i am going to take what they have told me and pass it down with my kids to their grandchildren and so on and to my friends and my family where they will always remember that this horrible thing happened and hopefully they can prevent it from ever happening again
they are learning from what we are teaching and they are teaching others
and that is the whole point of this project to teach their children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren
Growing up in the South growing up in rural Tennessee as i have
i have been exposed to a lot of racial remarks
you know my dad is the greatest man on earth
and i have no doubt of that
but he has a bias and he can make racial slurs and it is not anything against him
Going into college i had an African American roommate and loved him like a brother and still do
but it was nothing for me to even sometimes in his presence say racial slurs or and i look back now and l
i hope that it did not i guess
i hope it did not hurt him
this is one of your favorites is not it Cody
it is your favorite too
yeah it is and it was one of my favorites when i was little
and now this project i see things like that
Hit the ball said Danny
Hit a homerun said the dinosaur
it makes me you know very aware
and i make sure with two small sons that i do not say it
i do not want them to grow up and say that and say Well my father said this because that would
that would be the worst thing they could say
Good night
See you boys in the morning OK
Say your prayers before you go to sleep
by the time the survivors visited us we had more than four times the number of paper clips that we originally set out to collect
there was not a place in this school not even the broom closet that was not just flooded with paper clips
and we were at dinner one night with the Schroeders and conversation was just flowing and Linda just in between bites said
you know what i really wish we could have
i wish that we could have an authentic German railcar of the period to house our paper clips as a permanent memorial
and conversation just stopped
and we all kind of looked at each other and thought oh a railcar
oh we have to have a railcar
and the Schroeders were like this is the idea
we will find a railcar
we promise you we will find a railcar
i think when the decision was made to get the railcar and the Schroeders jumped in and volunteered to find one
i really do not think they knew what they were getting into
oh my God we wrote to everyone and his brother and asked him
do you know where a cattle car like this is
and everyone and his brother wrote us back
there are no such things
and then we decided to look for it ourselves
and we went on a detective tour
we drove 3 000 miles criss cross through Germany and went to every railyard we can imagine
and kaboom we found one
this car has a long history
it was built in 191 7 then in 1933 Nazism came and then it transported victims to concentration camps and then it went on another journey and the journey was from north of Berlin from the railroad museum to the German port of Cuxhaven
Well the Schroeders called us one day at school and said that they were successful in finding a car
and they said it would be a short time that they would ship the car from Germany to the United States to the port of Baltimore
Come on in we have got chairs
at 10 00 a m on November the 9th we hope to dedicate this railcar
when we got to a certain point in establishing this memorial we realized we needed lots and lots of help so we said OK we are going to have a community meeting
Right now we have on this property 27 plus million paper clips
we have got to have help
we have got to have a parking committee
we have to have a landscaping committee
it is got to look pretty around it now
we also have to figure out how to get the paper clips in there
you know you are talking about 22 metric tons you know
i have a hard time visualizing my fat self much less 22 metric tons
OK
now we will type these committees up
we will send all of you darlings a copy so do not you leave here until we get your address
lf you want to see where it is going come out here and i will show you
we had children from all the previous groups show up and they brought their parents with them and they saw that other people in the community came people they knew would be working to get this thing going
this community is going to have a piece of living history
like no other communities have
no large urban areas nobody else has a piece of history like we are going to have here
the car will sit approximately halfway between this point
sometimes when i think about this project
i think who is really in charge of this project cannot be closer than 20 feet to that wall
People who are interested in this project will call me up and say what is your plan
Well i have never had a plan
what do we know about building a memorial
what do i know about getting a railcar from Germany
i think that there is a far greater power than the people at Whitwell Middle School in charge of this project
and if not you tell me how we got this far
i said God created the world in less than seven days and someone said yes and he did not have Linda Hooper helping him
you have certain feelings when you see a car like this and you can not help but remember what happened in this car
our work is done i think
we brought the car over and that is it
you think so
i do not think so
i hope so
i do not think so
it will stay with us forever
that is possible
we thought we have seen this cattle car now numerous times
we know this cattle car
it can not do anything to us
then you realize what this car actually means
this car transported people to concentration camps
they put in 80 90 1 10 people
they suffocated in these cattle cars and one quarter of every victim of all the victims were children
now it is here in Baltimore and then it goes down to Chattanooga and to Whitwell but this will be the end of this car's journey
this car will not transport people anymore
this car will be a symbol
Symbols make us think
Symbols can change the world
and sometimes symbols are all we have to help us maintain our resolve even on our darkest and our most tragic days
the sun came up on Monday morn
the world was all in flames
it is all a mortal man can do
to make it right again
Swing and turn Jubilee
Live and learn Jubilee
the time has come to travel on
i made my way alone
Souls will mend at journey's end
this road will take me home
Swing and turn Jubilee
Live and learn Jubilee
Swing and turn Jubilee
Live and learn Jubilee
when i first saw the car it moved me almost to tears
that is the reason i went up and laid my hands on the car to start with
to sort of you know in my mind go over what is happened with this car and what it is meant to history and what it means to me personally
and then when it came here and i got to look inside it it just you know it killed me
it is unbelievable the thoughts that go through your head
i was one of the first to actually stand in the railcar
the floor was sort of rotten and you had to watch where you stepped
but just the thought of 100 people fitting in that small area is just it is heartbreaking
and Miss Hooper got up there with me and she just burst into tears
when people began to climb into the railcar
i just i could not handle that because to me it had a life of its own and i have never been in that car yet that i do not hear those voices and feel that pain
it survived in the face of overwhelming odds and now it is come home
Cassie and i were standing in the car today and we kind of had our hands on the car
and she said what would it tell us if it could talk
i said Cassie it would tell us you are paying homage to people
who suffered simply because of the way they believed and because of hatred and ignorance
this is all about not only mourning their loss but celebrating their life
what i did think that day is
from now on you will not be an instrument of pain
Your history as a death car is erased and now you are a car of new life and you are going to stand here and you are going to say
' Thereiis l good in this world'
from now until November 9th it will be a work in progress
it is hard for me to understand the enormity of this project of how many people know about it you know how far this project has reached
behind each side there will be 5  million paper clips
and i look at these people that are right here today and they are as excited about this as i am
we are doing it on a volunteer basis and just for the town and for the people
the whole community is involved in it and what little bit we can contribute why i am glad to do so
the idea for the butterfly came when Miss Hooper told me that a young person from Poland had written a poem and he lived in a ghetto
and he said in the poem i may never live to see another butterfly
Butterflies are a symbol of freedom and they are a symbol of this project
when you think about all the people that died
i am honoring those people with these butterflies more or less honoring them with wings so they can fly
Once we received all of the paper clips or the paper clips slowed to a very manageable amount we were well over 29 million paper clips
so when it came time to load the railcar with the paper clips the children were extremely selective
we will just start here
Alison 4500
they wanted to be sure that gifts from as many people as possible would go into the memorial
so they took paper clips from lots of different donations
we decided that we should put a total of 1 1 million paper clips into the car
that is good six million to represent the Jewish people who were murdered and five million representing the homosexuals the gypsies and the Jehovah's Witnesses and all the other people known to have been killed by Hitler's regime
this project had been the focus of my life for four years
i was Miss Roberts the Paper Clip Lady
but i can look at this child or this child and if that one child's life was changed then it was worth it
i think when you look at these paper clips the purpose of it is to remember those lives that were exterminated during the Holocaust
it just overwhelms you
what if those people had not been exterminated
who was destroyed there
was it another wonderful teacher
was it an artist
and i think of all the grandchildren that never came to be all the children that never came to be
what a wonderful way to remember the 6 million souls that perished
in Nazi death camps during World War ll
this especially touches me because 51 years ago
about two weeks after the war in Europe ended
i flew in as part of a rescue team
to bring food medicine medical assistance to the then recently liberated Mauthausen death camp near Lintz Austria
as we went by the medical center i believe that this young lady saw the mezuzah i was wearing
she was very emaciated
i would say she was probably 20 years old my age at the time but i do remember to this day her very very large beautiful brown eyes who looked probably more beautiful because her face was so thin and she said to me in Yiddish which means'Are you Jewish' which i am and she took my hands clasped them and kissed them
as weak as she was holding my hand
i felt that it became weaker and then we had to move on
and then it was time to leave
and i went by the medical building and i asked how the young lady was
that is when they told me her name was Malka and they said
she died shortly after you left
and i had not mentioned this to anyone even my wife and my children did not know that story
i had great difficulty
i actually broke down and cried and i do not cry easily but that was the first time since it happened that i let it out of me
the letter was so much of a closure for me
because Malka has found a resting place a final resting place not in Austria not in Germany not in Poland but Appalachia Tennessee
and i can not get over that
it is giving her a resting place among young people who love her and have compassion for her
and you could not ask for a better resting place than that
and this one represents Malka the lady at Mauthausen
and we are going to treat these paper clips like the children have said one of them said to me Ms Hooper when you touch these
can you feel the souls
Well yes you can feel the souls because most of them came with a letter that told you about the soul that paper clip represented
and you know if we accomplish nothing else we have helped these people find a resting place for something that was important to them
so she had never displayed never done any sculpture before
they are great
they are great
oh my God
my God
it is good
it is really good
it is really good
now that i have had these kids and spent all these hours with them
i see that they have a lot of input to give and that i was very very quick to judge
i listen to what they say and i value their input
it is a gift to me
it is a gift to my children
because it is made me a better dad better father better teacher better man
Good morning
i am so grateful to live in the United States of America
i have such joy for all the love and the work that has gone into this project and i have such pride that i live in a community where a group of very ordinary people could bring to reality such an extraordinary event
my heart is absolutely filled and overflowing with joy and pride
i love this community and i love these children in this school
there are so many people here today that deserve a hug
to each one of you we say thank you for giving your time and your talents
i also would like to recognize David Smith and Sandra Roberts
Get up guys
i have learned more from this project than i ever could have taught
it has very slowly become not about me
and our Holocaust students
Stand up
it is about what will the students gain from this what will they learn and what will they take from this into their future lives
you will come at one time in your life and believe me this point will come
you come to a point where you think everything goes wrong nothing nobody loves you you are lost or you might be a failure and then please come back to your memorial
this is what you did and accomplished
Come to this place and it will uplift you and i hope then you will try again
and i am pretty sure that you will succeed again
Whitwell is a place that brings out the best of all of us
Thank you for that and we love you
when the living say this prayer they remember the dead
ln remembering the dead
we remember the values that they have taught us
the students from the Davis Academy in Atlanta Georgia will now lead us in the Kaddish
we will not forget you
do not let the memory disappear
do not let the memory disappear
the job of collecting paper clips is over but the job of educating others will never be over
and i think our job now is to give tours of the railcar and to branch off into other schools and teach our lessons of the Holocaust
they would stand at roll call between 5 and 6 hours to count how many people were there
when we have field trips and the teachers say what do we need to do and i say nothing
you might want to take your group out to the railcar and walk them out there
and i say you are not a teacher today you are just an observer
These children will teach
and they teach
how many people was actually here during the Holocaust
80 to 100 people
the Norwegians wore paper clips like we are doing now
on their collars
my dear friends from Whitwell words can only inadequately describe
what your extraordinary project means to me
a Holocaust survivor and teacher
i witnessed what intolerance and indifference can lead to
ln a short while i will be 95 years of age
i am thankful that late in life
i can see and hear that the teaching of tolerance
is still alive and well and bears fruit
when i heard about your project i cried
i cried because you are the testament that a new age has dawned
the age of responsibility
and the age of kindness of the heart
you are living proof that each and every one of us
can make a difference and do his part to shape a better world
when you ask the young and innocent they will do the right thing
with tears in my eyes i bow my head before you
Shalom
Lena L Gitter
i just can not wait until i get to college and they ask me if you have ever had a life changing moment
the first thing that is going to come out of my mouth is going to be the Whitwell Middle School Holocaust project
i just cannot wait until that moment happens
ln the future when i do come back and see it knowing that i was here to do this it will be like not just a memory but kind of in your heart to know that you have changed the way people think about other people
to think that us people from Whitwell Tennessee if we have made such a big difference think what the rest of the world could do if they tried
not only did we educate other people about the Holocaust but we educated ourselves
we will never look at a paper clip the same way againthe hands
or the horrible claws of the monster touched the body of Melissa
and then
Hey what are you writing
my new best seller
Ah

Sweetie you risk too much

i know you are taking a risk but we have no choice if we want to escape from here
Go far away and forget all about this
to escape we need money and to get that we need them
i just hope it works
so Sylvia having fun
yes very much it is wonderful here
you are lucky to live in such a place
nothing to do but lie in the sun breathe the clean air lulled by the waves
you are right it is wonderful
but you are staying near the sea are not you
yes but in a cheap hotel
and only for ten days holiday
it is a horrible room with no view of the sea
Listen Sylvia i have got an idea
Why do not you move in here
an excellent idea really
the three of us could amuse each other
do you like Bob
yes i find him very friendly
that is all
Tell me i am not the jealous type
you can talk to me as a friend
but he is your husband
that is not a problem
i like him to have fun
and sometimes i might even join in
what do you mean
Sylvia
yes Bob
Move in here
i want you
i think i love you
Forget that nonsense about your hotel
Come
Come and live here
i can not
you are crazy
yes he is crazy
that is why i love him
and you will too
now stop worrying we can talk about it later
Let's go and get your things Alright but i will do it
i will be back in half an hour
you see
it is easy to convince them
i knew it would be
now smile
she is very stupid
i wonder what you are doing
Ah' why'
i am going to spend the weekend with friends who know very rich people
who supposedly have a wonderful house on a small island
over yonder
i believe there are wonderful views
but you know it could be dangerous
oh
Even deadly
do you think so
i am not joking
first of all your great couple are scumbags
you have strange ideas
you do not know her friends
you do not know who they are
and then on an island
you do not know this island's reputation
this is crazy
on an island anything could happen to you
Rape sadistic crimes
oh yes islands are very dangerous
Honolulu Puerto Rico the Bahamas Hawaii
yes but the island of Dr Moreau
the island of Fu Manchu and the island of Count Zaroff
i do not know these people and i would never be invited fur the weekend
i want you
i need you
every touch is driving me crazy
Your skin so soft so sensual
Your lips so enticing
Come do not leave me alone
Sylvia
Come here
that is enough it is my turn now
Dirty bitch
Come Sylvia
what a pity i wish we could stay here
oh yeah
Come on we have to get dressed
they are waiting for us Come on let's go
Go girls let's go
this house scares me
do not be silly
she is beautiful is not she Radar
oh yes quite charming
a real jewel for a collector like me
yes Sylvia it is a pleasure for us to know someone so lovely
Right Rador
a huge pleasure
you are sweet and tender
how old are you my child
who cares
she is here she is a looker
what more do you need
Forgive me Mr Nubar i did not mean to offend you
you haven't
are you two finished
Listen here
you do not talk to the Count like that
he just wanted to know more about our guest
you know we love such details you bet i know
Please Bob do not be so rude
Bob is a man with strong passions
had his education been as strong he'd be perfect
Shut it
i do not bear grudges
and to prove it
here is the best piece of meat
Keep it i do not want it
Control yourself
i am sorry he is not been himself these last days
so i see
Maybe you should leave
Your illness might prove dangerous
i will be fine now
Poor Bob he struggles with the pleasures of the flesh
that is it i am off
i want no part of your vile orgies
Shame he is usually such a sweet boy
yes he is very sweet
do you like our favorite meat Sylvia
do not ask the sweet girl to lie this meat is rather tough
not up to our usual standard
but next time
oh sorry you won't be here
Why
it could be
Am i upsetting you
on the contrary
it is just that you will have already left by the time we start cooking
oh yes that is a fact
Already left indeed
it is so lovely here
yes it is
Spectacular
but i prefer the beauty of the human body
i did not hear you come in
i thought you might need something to wear in bed
Thanks
but where is Moira
is she asleep already
yes
she was very tired
she is quite delicate
is that a problem
yes because i really like her
You'd like to play with her
yes we already have
i will do my best to help you forget Moira
i will be back once Rador is asleep
oh yeah right there oh
Bitch
oh yeah
oh yes
more
oh yeah yeah
Sylvia what are you doing
Leave her be my dear
she is curious like all kids
you know it is no easy task to cut off a human head it is hard work
Come my dear
Come and help us
a fine trophy for my little collection
but it is monstrous
how could you
we will keep the rest of her body
she is magnificent
her flesh will be so tender
Moist
her breasts are superb
they are my favorite pieces
you eat human flesh
Ah of course
you also by the way
the meat that you enjoyed was human flesh
and it tasted good to you
you are completely insane
that is disgusting
Come my child do not upset yourself
Reject nothing that gives pleasure
do not be so conventional
Admit you enjoyed the meal
she is dim but she is certainly juicy
i think we are going to have fun my dear
another festive meal
it will soon be dawn
Why prolong my torture
i know what you want
you want to kill me
Put my head next to those those other poor innocents
that would be ton easy
and far too cheap for us
we are artists
you have no conception of the nobility of certain emotions
i Countess Zaroff am incapable of killing in cold blood
i love the hunt
the game of life and death
i always give my prey a chance to escape
at dawn we shall let you loose
Exactly ten minutes later my sweet
i will hunt you down with my bow
if we have not caught you when the church cluck strikes 9
you will be free
and i myself will take you back to dry land
These are the rules of the game
or else
or else you become a lender and succulent roast for our table
the birds are already singing
it is dawn
Let it begin
Bastards
Did it go well
Very well
we will get 2 million for her
no
Countess
Countess
Why
i will call the police
i will call the police do you hear
no i do not think you will call the police
you are involved in this affair too
Why
i have waited for this moment so long my love
for me you will be the best meal of my life
Sylvia Sylvia
Sylvia wake up Sylvia
Sylvia are you all right
are not you hurt Sylvia

Why

Growls
Bye see you
Knocks hi
Nice moves
what are you
i am not gonna tell anybody
but just a hint
if you want to keep a secret do not rehearse where you work unless you know you are the only one with a set of keys
Thanks i will try to remember that
you know er
Think i could pry you away
Maybe grab a drink
not real thirsty
Cool
Cool
Er next time
i could eat
Well i got the perfect place
Growing up my mom used to tell me stories about Chicago the lights energy the people
she dreamed of coming here and being a dancer
that is where you got the moves from
yep
she studied to be one
Chose to be a mom instead
so she passed the dream down to me
is she still in Glenwood
no no
she passed away
i am sorry
she got pretty sick when i was about 10 and it took a lot out of us especially my dad
after Mom he just spent all his time in the garage
he said it kept his mind off missing her
and then one night three years ago
i was coming back to the garage after a recital
Joel was in Indy picking up equipment and he'd asked me to stay with Dad
but some dancer friends wanted to go out to dinner
Later when i did get to the garage i found him on the floor
He'd had a heart attack
i always wonder if I'd just got there 10 minutes earlier
you can not do that to yourself
after that i put school on hold to stay and help Joel out with the shop
since losing Dad it is just been the two of us
that had to be hard
you know all of it
yeah
Sighs
so what is in there
this
this is the best sweet and sour shrimp in Chicago
Really
Want some
Sure
yeah that is Lincoln Park where all the kids hang out with the students and what not
then you got downtown where the bankers are
that is pretty much Chicago
Well
Thank you for a wonderful dinner
Anytime
i do not remember seeing that on the menu
yeah well that is the Chef's Special
Good night
Good night
Hey
hi
how is it going
Good
so i had a good time last night
me too
you have got to be kidding me
Carmen's running late
Doesn't Dana go on first anyway
do you see Dana
no because she called in sick
and i have a line
i can spin till Carmen gets here
i have three birthday parties and a room full of VlPs
no offence Russ but they did not come to hear you spin
you could let Lauryn dance
what
Brenda i have seen her dance OK she is good
Why do not you just give her a shot
Look Lauryn you are a sweet kid but you are obviously no dancer
Why did you tell her that
what you are gonna hide out back here
what you saw me doing was fooling around
i do not dance like Ruby's girls
so do your thing
Trust me when you get on stage nobody's gonna care
Well i care
you moved to Chicago to be a dancer
i moved here to go to school
OK
i am sorry
Brenda Look price doesn't matter as long as you get her here
yes a cab

Beginner you got that right
Well that just proves how good you were tonight
Cheers
Cheers
you wanna get out of here
Russ Really
you grew up around a garage
Lauryn yeah i know my way around a car
I'd like to see you as a grease monkey
oh yeah
That'd be Joel's dream come true keeping me in that shop
Well he is just a protective brother
a little too protective
he doesn't want me to get my hopes up so he means well i guess
this is really impressive
it is my entire life right here
that yours too
Mm hm
yeah i gotta admit something that is been bothering me for a while
what is that
i lied
when i said i liked corn that was a blatant lie
i actually hate corn
Wow
i feel betrayed like i do not even know you any more
Play me something you wrote
what now
no
no it is
Quit stalling Music Man
OK
OK
this one i will play you is
it is not finished yet
and er you know do not judge it

Jazzy dance tune

on the sax that is you too
Mm hm
you should play more

Thanks
so that is pretty much it

Why not
Cos i haven't got around to it
i think someone's eager to change the subject
yeah
yeah
this your thing
Going though all the girls at the club
Mm hm all of them
that is what i thought
first Carmen and then who else
you know somebody needs to shut you up
oh really
Mm hm
what is wrong
i think i had too much to drink
Well then you er should not drive
i am sorry i do not
i do not think i am ready for that yet
that is not what i was talking about
ALANA D
Break it down
Phone rings
Sighs heavily
Hey
got your email
yeah i was gonna call you
i got a job
at a garage
no at a club called Ruby's
OK what is with the silence
had to let Marty go
it is no biggie just a little downsizing
' so how is the school'
it is good
i sent you some stuff i found in the attic i thought you might want
'Some of Mom's things'
Thanks
i gotta go
i booked some studio time and my class is starting so i should
yeah
yeah sorry
Take care
Lauryn i have three regulars outside asking when they will see you dance again
i told them tonight
can you be ready
yeah
you haven't earned the right to be on that stage
Excuse me
yeah you are a dime a dozen
Just another girl from Bumbalow trying to make it big
Guess what this is the real world and people come to see something special
not that stuff you do
Bullshit Carmen
i have trained my whole life
Please
the tradition takes years to perfect
you do not just roll in and own it
Lauryn ten minutes and you are up
what is going on
Break a leg
Really
i mean it
Ladies and gentlemen let's give a warm Ruby's welcome to the newest addition to the family
Lauryn
Cheering Unkle Jam
Love Ya
Like you said girl's got moves
so er this school you auditioned for did they say anything you know like why you did not get in
Sort of i guess
can i be honest with you
i think whoever made that decision is nuts
OK the director of the dance department did not like my routine
he said he thought it was not sensual or feminine enough or something like that
Let's wrestle him into Ruby's one night and prove him wrong
i do not think he is looking for Ruby's kind of dancers
this guy can not have final say in your life
Well no offence but he is a world renowned choreographer so i think he knows a little bit more about dance than me and you
Well i know what i see and i see that you could be as sexy as Carmen if you wanted to be
oh really
you know what Russ
my life's goal is not to be as sexy as Carmen
Hey
i am sorry that came out wrong
oh you think
yeah
this is not about Carmen this is about you
you can mix it up better than any of those girls at Ruby's and trust me i have seen'em all
and you have the potential to go so much further
that is all i was trying to say
what
Come on
Ow
you know you are kind of cute when you are mad
i am not talking to you
i am just saying
Shut up
Mom
Hey
Hey
Your routine felt a little off tonight
something on your mind
Just some stuff from back home i guess
my favourite teacher once told me dance is a window to the soul
it doesn't let you hide
but if you always fight what you feel you will never tap into what could make you not just a good dancer but a great one
yeah
Lock up when you leave OK
OK
KEKE PALMER
Bottoms Up
Get off the wall do not matter what they think
from your fingertips to your toes
you know you are hot so let everybody know
Gotta take it low Bottoms up bottoms up
yeah keep it movin' man make it poppin' man
i am on the move gotta catch me when you can
might see my face on the movie screen
Hypnotise you frame by frame scene by scene
Get your head up do your thang
Get off the wall do not matter what they think
Knocking
Coming
is something wrong
no not at all
you just look amazing
Come on in
you are a closet romantic
Well i have been called worse
shall we
Wait
Let me
Thank you
you are welcome
may i offer you some wine
yes please
Thank you
Sizzling
oh no
i gotta check the oven
i will be right back
how about a take out
i do not know it is like as long as the shop is alive a little piece of my parents is too
so it would kill me if Joel ever closed it
you two sound close
we have had our moments
so i wanted to thank you for the other night
for what
you were right
i can not let somebody i have met once decide what i want
so i did some research and the School of Music and Dance usually accepts 20 applicants in a school year
but this year only 18 qualified
so they are holding a second round of auditions for the next semester to find their remaining two dancers
you are gonna re audition
i think so
in three weeks the problem was the record company got in my business trying to tell me how to do it you know
i thought i knew better so so i walked away
Just like that
Just like that
i backed out of the deal and fell in with the wrong crowd and er and er you know
Eventually i ended up at Ruby's and i straightened myself out
See here is the thing
See everybody who walks away from a dream has a reason
i think it is brave to take another shot
sometimes i just feel like i am doing it all wrong
Well you are not
Listen to me JAMELlA
Beware of the Dog
you know how much you want him
you are trying to be cool about it you are trying to be big about it
you are constantly just denying
you are like a moth to a flame can hardly wait but listen
Cause i know what i am saying
Cheers and applause
Joel stop
Wait
could you put some clothes on
what are you doing here
i came to congratulate you on getting into the school only they have never heard of a Lauryn Kirk
you call this chasing your dreams
is this all the hard work you have been doing
i did not get in
i did not know how to tell you
but if you'd stuck around you'd see how difficult the routines are
i saw enough
Why do not you listen for a change
i am on the verge of losing the shop and i drove six hours for this
what do you mean
i have to sell or the bank'll foreclose
i can not make the payments
what
Equipment leases everything
Why did not you tell me
Why would you care
you are a big city girl now you are a dancer
Why have you always had a problem with me dancing
you think the world revolves around you you always have
how dare you
i put my life on hold for three years Joel
and you put Dad on hold that night
you should've been there Lauryn
Hey you OK
Maybe he was upset because you were so bad
Ease off Carmen
she was killing it
he drives hours to get here then has her embarrass the family name
Hey hey stop stop
Lauryn i am sick of your shit
Enough
you happy Carmen
God girl
Lauryn
Lauryn wait
she is just trying to get in your head
she can get in line cos there is enough going on in there already
Hey come on
i know that this was a lot but he knows now
you do not have to lie any more
what if he is right
all my life my family gave up so much for me
what if i am selfish
what are you going to do you just going to quit dancing
Gonna quit living your life
Joel's the only family i have
i should not be here chasing some stupid dream
i should be home helping him
i am sorry i have to go
who do you think you are fooling
i know you are going home because you are scared of that audition
what
if this was about your brother you'd have told him before tonight
what are you talking about
i know that you are running because you are scared and that is it
i am sorry if it shocks you that I'd help my family out in a time of crisis but that is how we do things where i come from
Lauryn come on
Lauryn you are making a big mistake
Lauryn
what are you doing here
i found two new wholesalers we can use
that should catch us up half way
Wait just slow down for a second
are you back here to work
i am not gonna let you sell
we can catch up
Look i said some things i did not mean
i know
i am sorry
OK

CLASSlC
so they Say
Subtitles by LeapinLarWelcome
you have just entered the painting
you could think time has stopped but it hasn't
Everyone's at his place and holding his breath
in the castle over there the Toupins are living
Currently it is going good for them
they think they are in paradise
Below in the shadow at the root of the blue tree the lovers embrace
See them
they believe in their love
but they have to hide because Ramo is a Toupin and my friend Claire is a Pafini
like me
i await her
i have got pins and needles in my legs already
i almost forgot to tell you about the Reufs
they are even worse
they do not believe in anything
oh yes
here everybody sees the world in their own way
Well i must leave you
i also have a part this tale
over here
you see him
he is escaping
he is there
he is going towards the lake
Bastard
what do we do
we won't see him in this thicket
Leave him
we will find another one
Did they catch him
no they are coming back without him
it is not easy they are doodles
how is their name again
the Reufs
oh yes the Reufs
they disgust me
how did the painter let it happen
they were his first sketches
he should have erased them
Just they do not come near the castle
our young Toupins must have fun too
is not it beautiful
you see all those lights
what happened to you
oh clever
what are we gonna do now
the stairs are on the other side
those colors so wonderful
this color looks great on you dear
you are not so bad either
Look
over there
that Pafini
she got no self respect
Surely they won't let her come up
Please i implore you
i am almost completed
Go away
do not understand
the Toupins are finished
yes but
Get lost
Ah the Pafinis
they always try to enter the castle
the garden is big enough
they have got all the space they need
i hope they will finally understand it tonight
Did you hear them
Hatred always the hatred
how far will they go
i am afraid
they won't dare hurt you
i do not fear for myself
i fear our love won't last any longer in this cold shadow
we must hide all the time
Day and night
i can barely see your face
i see yours Claire
Tell me
i have never seen my own face
it is beautiful elegantly simple
Your eyes are like blue almonds marvellously drawn
Your cheeks are golden like the sky
Your mouth is like this flower rosy with a touch of crimson
it is colored
of course
Ramo hold me tight please
Lie to me again
Tell me we could
love each other freely
they are not lies
i feel that the painter will come back
Even if he did not
I'd look for him at the end of the world
and he will finish the painting
Lola's right we can not stay here
i will see you at the lake tonight
Come with us
i wana know how they prepare
and the Pafinis do not like me
Claire
i will tell you
Go with them now
i love you
there he is
Look
Hush
my friends my dear friends
you have chosen me to proudly wear our colors
and maybe also to voice out loud what everyone is thinking
the painter will never come back
Finally someone brave must say it
we must recognize this fact
such was his decision
and if he has made of us the Toupins the only perfectly drawn beings of his works it is because such was his intention
and naturally that means it falls to us now to put the castle in order
the Pafini have no business here
we must chase them away once and for all time
you are no doubt right our castle is not infinite
can we find place for all the sketches from the painting
they must go
in the Forest
in the Forest
Exactly
who could blame us
me
who is that
Young Ramo
the one whowith that girl
how exactly are the Toupins superior to the Pafinis
is not it obvious
the painter wanted it that way young man
what do you know
are you speaking for him
Listen
we do not know why the painter disappeared
but he can come back any day and finish his work
Shut up
he talks nonsense
you are proud of your looks
me i feel ashamed everytime i hear you talk
Feel superior because you wear glittering costumes
Better than a rough sketch
or a barely outlined girl
my friends my friends
our young Ramo tries to defend his liaison with a young Pafini
we understand it is typical for his age
but to understand doesn't mean accept everything
Blissful idealism is outdated
Equality freedom the castle for everyone
for the Pafinis
Why not for the Reufs
Let go off me
do not you see he only wants power
do not be duped
the Painter will be back
yes yes he will be back he will back
no my friends believe me
do not be ashamed of being the better ones to be the most beautiful
my dear little hearts you are the light of this castle
Vive the Great Chandelier
Look
a Reuf
what horror
he slipped into the castle
Stop
are you mad
this boy is dangerous
do not you think Mr Grey
we can take care of it Great Chandelier
do you hear them
i do not like this song
they are getting each other worked up like the devils
if only you knew how they treated me
do not go with them
it is unfair
i also wanna have fun
the only dancing we are gonna do is to try and dodge their blows
you know what he told me
that my lips were colored
i adore him
i even almost believed him
you are lucky
but if he loves you why does he lie to you
they are beautiful white lies
Life is so sad here
Let's keep quite
it is the Reufs they are after
they slip everywhere
it is hard to see them
they risk nothing
Listen to them they all want to be Toupins
me too i admit
not me
i am happy
because you are not in love
when you love you are not alone in the wolrd
there is him and me
there is our love
he wants to live large to be accepted by everyone
it is true i have never had a lover
but I'd go find my lover elsewhere
Elsewhere
and where'd you go petite Lola
there is no elsewhere
there is the castle the garden nothing else
Except the damned forest
the Forest we know nothing about it
no one's been in there
what are you doing
i will meet him
he is waiting
where you are going
Let me pass
she will meet her lover
Come on it is none of your business
Lola is right
Let her go
she will betray us
her Ramo is a Toupin
no he is not like the others
he will be worried
Relax
Wait a little bit
they will let me pass
Gom
oh no
what have they done to you
the monsters
Poor poor idiot
no
no
Ramo
is it you
i can not help you
i am waiting for someone
i did not ask for anything
where is Claire
the Pafinis did not want to let her go
Everybody is against us
Let's go get her
what is this Reuf doing here
he is also hiding
there they are
yes i see them
where are you going
this is not the right way
the current is taking us
Current
this lake has no current
what are you doing
we are going towards the
the Forest
the Flowers of Death
oh no
it is horrible
they will devour them
it makes my blood freeze
so Silouet
the Toupins pursued them to the Forest
and then
Did they escape
at the entrance the giant flowers ate them
there were three of them
Lola a Reuf and
and the young Toupin no
it is not true
Why are you lying
we passed
i can not believe it
they did not eat us
do you see now
our people talk nonsense
Why did i enter your pirogue
how do we find Claire
it is not my fault
i did what i could
are you ok
nothing broken
Leave me alone
and him must not come closer
he won't hurt you
do not touch it
Ok calm down
Claire is over there with those maniacs
and i am here with this brat and this weeping Reuf
if only the Painter could see this
we just have to go find him
if you want my opinion he doesn't care about us
Why not
i have been thinking about it for sometimes
we can always tell him
he will finish the Pasfinis
and the Reufs
Naturally
Hmm
he will have a little more work that is all
where is he
do not you know it
this forest is not so scary
Why not continue
which direction
it is so dark
I'd go over there
or there
you are not helping
Enough
we turn our back on the castle and go straight ahead
Hey
can not you see me
i am
he is caught in the vines again
he never completes a sentence
Maybe because he is a Reuf
it is annoying
i understand him
you must have trouble
yes i know
i am slowing you down eh
i just can not stop getting all tangled up
Aie
Watch the head
Well
Just leave me here
Leave me
oh all right
Stay here is you like
and if you see him tell him that
Hey
do not you think that
he is right
we went this way three times already
we are lost
Nonsense
it is true i tell you
Stay together
it is funny i feel so lightLike a feather
Look
Lola
Lola
Wait for us i do not see you anymore
Lola
i can not hear her
i am herehanging
you see her
yes way down there
she is
Ramo
yes i see you
all right
all right
do not move
we are coming
what is up
to your positions
what is up
Get in line
who is there
Get that girl
Girl
there
in the tree
Plume
i need more rope
oh no you came down
i was afraid all alone
do not blame me
Hang on
Damn spy
the Greens sent you huh
the Greens
i am from another painting just above yours
the rope broke
a painting
what rubbish
Well i see that i bothered you
my apologies
she is mocking us
it is true i swear
you are in a painting
a painting of war
War is a serious matter kid
you will see tomorrow when we execute you that your blood is not water colour
you are lying
but
Captain
the Greens are ready to fight
they did not waste time
Magenta Solfrino
Keep an eye her
we never saw you before
Nobody believes me
Try me
she is a liar
you are in a painting of a battle
and i really wanna get out
Drummer Magenta prepare to sound the charge
the charge
i have got enough of this war
my place is not here
you sure we can get out of here
Sure i got in uncuff me
Maybe she is right Solfrino
do not listen
what are you doing
you won't get out of here
where were you
and where is he from
it is Magenta
he helped me he is a brave boy
he is with us
what have i done
Go ahead
do not be shy i am used to it
Plume is very fragile
Forgive me Plume
True it is not very solid your nose
Well i wonder what we do here
Totally abandoned
Maybe he is gone far away
and if he is here listening to us right now
Let him show himself then
do not talk about someone who is not even here
he is grumpy
no life is so beautiful
Only high quality paint everywhere
Harmony tolerance
down here is the great void
Lola
yes
when you meet him what will you ask him
Ramo thinks he hasn't finished painting us
i will ask him why he painted a battle
he should've painted the sea
i have always dreamt of going to the seaside
and you what will you ask him
me
i do not know yet
there are so many things I'd like to understand
Why are we sometimes happy or unhappy
Claire
what is with him
he is in love
oh yeah
and the painter will fix that too
Grand Chandelier
when she came out of the forest she smiled like an angel
i think our young Ramo is not dead
the Flowers of Death did not like their taste
Odd
Unless
you think something protects them
Love mr
Grey
Love
yes love
you know what you need to do
Your wishes are my commands Grand Chandelier
they are so fragile
who spoke
Did you hear
no
Somebody spoke
from the curtain over there
Ssshhh
Call me Garance
and who are you
Go ahead Lola
Erwell
i am sure you will believe us
we fell out of our painting and we are looking for the painter
Odd that he left you like that
he used to finish his works to the least detail
my dress for example
but you are naked
oh yes it is true
what was i thinking
i think we woke up Orange de Mars
Did you come to play with me
we are looking for the painter
and you do not know what he looks like
Tall or short
if you met him you would not even know it because you do not know him at all
and you young man you know him
Young man
i am a Harlequin
and i know the painter
he is not far away
behind you on the easel
it is him
it is the painter
no unfortunately
it is just a self portrait
are you happy now
you woke everyone up
where do you think you are
we are in the painter's studio
Excuse us if we have bothered you
he abandoned you eh
i am not surprised
he is arrogant and contemptuous
and you you chase after him
like a bunch of idiots
Why are you saying that
are you upset with us
i am always upset
i can not help it
do not expect me to ever be happy
i just can not
True when he painted me he was in a good mood
and so were i consequently
and then i do not know what happened to him
or rather i know it well
you do not know what she has let us suffer
Look at her
Madame is still in love
you will notice the way she looks at me
Hold on
i know full well you are not the painter
Painters can not see themselves
i do not look like him
not true you are his true image
we have to find him
i hate him
Meaning i hate myself in a way it it really painful to have feelings that are not your own
i just want to be myself that is all
it is not too much to ask
oh you are so pretty
he must have been pleased
Heu i am not sure
you forgot
Come here Lola
me i could never forget him
he was please with me too you know
he loved me
he did not say it but i could feel it
one day he soaked his brush in his coffee and drank from the flake of castor oil
he did not even realize it
i was not afraid
his look was sweet
first he outlined me with vigorous strokes
then he chose the colors of my eyes my skin my hair without neglecting the least detail of my body
then he adorned me with fine lace lingerie
and to finish an admirable dress
the painter sure had style i tell you
what happened to your dress
i thought he was done
but then one day he picked up his paintbrushes and removed one after the other all my clothes
oh
L l
and you said nothing
no
it was a pleasant sensation
you are very beautiful this way
oh yes
you think
I'd like to meet him
where did he go
you should know
Maybe he returned to Venice
Venice was a real passion for him
Venice is a woman
Venice is a city
a dream
Men love women Lola
but they love their dreams even better
and how do we get there
Easy
oh no
Lola
where are you going
Wait for us
Plume
are you there
yes as you can see
no
i see nothing
the paint paint
the painting
who could have done this
him of course
the painter
he can destroy us
at least this means he really exists
Lola has gone to find him
Quick we must warn them
Oops
i am breathless
you dance like that all day
yes
Tomorrow we start again
every day the same
it is not funny but that is the carnival
you are not from here
Hey
what are you doing
you are not the painter
what
and that what is that
Dead paint
Dead paint
Wait until i
and then he is much more handsome
Impudent child
you know nothing
everyone wears a mask here
it is required
Really
i did not know
you do not know much at all
Take it off then
Hey
no
Wait
do not leave
Look at this crowd
we will never find them
Nonsense
they must be warned
Maybe he already erased them
what is so bad with this painting
Your work
i could have finished it but she vanished
a real beauty
but i could not make her stay
you like paintings
it is unfinished
i will make a fair price
i can make it better
Usually i do not paint from memory but you will soon see it will be done quickly
i am not so bad with colors actually
it is capturing motions that gives me trouble
this girl where is she
Gone
Vanished i told you
so do not you want it
oh well too bad
i am giving up painting
People just won't stop moving
Ramo
Well mr
Grey how is she behaving
she cries she calls for him
her cries are painful to hear Grand Chandelier
of course Mr Grey
of course
they say love is blind though it can hear
Ramo will soon re appear
Prepare our little ceremony
Lola
Follow me
the painter's over there
do not go there
it is dangerous
what
i can not hear you
Follow that gondola
where are you
here we are miss
there is your painter
oh no
Look there are at least 350
they come here every evening for the sunset
no
i do not believe you
he could not have done that
it is true
there were dozens of them ripped open burnt
Cut up
it is not possible
how beautiful
the sun descending into the sea green on red water
a sunset it is tasteless
he should stop painting rubbish
it is not rubbish
it is called feelings
when he is sad he paints sadness
and when he is in love he paints Garance
Even if it is not her he is in love with he still paints Garance
then he cuts her up in pieces
i have no desire to meet him
you won't meet him so soon
Why
the painter is not here
we are in his painting
he can not be in and out of his painting at once
what about them
Forgers who paint what he painted
i do not get it
Let me tell you something
we do not need him
Hmm where did i put it
oh
my dress
Look at that
you have been sitting on my idea
what is it
Paint
so what
oh yes
you think we could
we need some more
a little practice and then
Say will it pain you to complete your sentences
Bah
you have got some nerve
here are our friends again
who gave you permission to enter my home
Get out
what is this horror
Yellow
Plenty of it on my dress
you should fix that
it is awful
Ah that is clever
there we go
Magnificent
you think
you can paint
it is funny i have never tried it before
yes it is not so bad
you are still upset
i am it is in my nature
Even though I'd like to help you
Teach us how to paint
you got his bad mood maybe his talent also
to complete his work
it won't displease me
i need more colours
Orange red ochres
on the table are a few
Indigo on top of the piano
Veronese
in the drawer
you first Plume
no
i can wait
him first
oh
what will i do with this doodle
Doodle
he is my friend
what was he like your friend
he was very kind
to paint kindness
how will you do it
Hewas a little plump
yes but not like that
no flabbiness
yes that is it
Delicate sensitive
a good guy you know
what am i doing here
Plume
Dear old pal you have come back
Silouet have you got news
Why all those noises
the Toupins are cooking up something
they caught all the Reufs and make them work
These Reufs are incompetent
they are doing it on purpose
Get out all you
we need able bodies
Pafinis or Reufs all the same
Out
Faster
you too
we will stay under the trees to the right of the camp
you come with us Magenta
Wait
i have an idea
Come on
Hurry up
Go on ahead
we will join you later
there we go again
i will see if the way is clear
Wait here
and do not touch anything before i come back
Toupin
Looking for Claire
what happened
where are they
where is she
Come i will show you
i understand
Count on me
do not forget anyone
Ramo
is it you
oh my poor love
where were you
Far far away
no more worry
everything will be all right now
Ramo
no
Stop
do not hurt him
Let go off him
you have no rightt
Come on advance
there they are
but it is Plume and Gom
no it is not them
yes look
Unbelievable
they are magnificent
it is not possible
are you sure it is them
Come closer
you have here everything you need
all the colors all the brushes
and most of all the freedom to paint yourselves
Take a pastel tone a lively tone or a bleaker tone
Look at me
i am sure you do not recognize me
it is true he has changed a lot
he speaks well now
i will show you
there
you need good strokes and dexterity
Follow the curves
like this
you see it is easy
yes but i do not want this color
do not like it
it is pretty
Gimme that
do it yourself then but
you said we could paint
Like that
Calm down
Enough for everyone
it is very beautiful
Mommy i want purple
Why is there no purple
Let go off me
Let go
there you are finally
Look at them
what a mess
a rotten mess
Sorry
we did what we could
there you are
do not disturb us
what is the program
how are you dear friend
he loves mysteries
i hope we will have fun
i am here
they are so young
here are our young pigeons reunited as they desired
are not they cute
but what am i seeing
they do not look happy
Look how pale they are
they say nothing anymore
so young man
where are your fine speeches
has the painter returned
Did you meet him
will he according to your wishes
what has he said already
Ah yes
Abolish differences
to abolish differences
you could not ask more
we shall not distinguish you from each other anymore
Executioner black execution
Look at those colors
it is wonderful
who are they
Toupins
Let's go and see
it is absolutely magnificent
Fresher more Parisian
do not talk to them
i forbid you
a lot of colors are available
my dear you are gorgeous
Change yourself
Your colors are glistening
we have paintbrushes colors
Change the Great Chandelier too
Bring up the colors
he is running away
yes yes of course
there are other paintings
we can go from one to another without difficulty
Well almost
there are some differences in colors
some paintings are greener some redder
do not make a drama out of it
so Lola
how do you find me
but your dress
you can not stay that way
we can even abandon ourselves to frenzied farandoles
Exactly
Just ask Lola
Heh Lola
no
you
Come on Miro
Quiet
Relax he won't bite
he can not see clearly anymore
Say i know you you left your painting
yes
are you angry
and i am not alone you know
but be assured they won't bother you
they are busy painting
the Pafinis the Reufs
Painting
but who taught you to paint
Your self portrait
oh no not him
he came out too
no no
he is sleeping again
in our painting people thought you abandoned them
Abandoned
what are you saying
i did not abandon them
i gave them the basic essentials
a simple drawing can be more beautiful than an elaborate painting
so they completed themselves eh
Well it is all right then
it is all very good
but you
you are not like the others
Why did you come here
you still paint
yes but only landscapes
it is less tiring
what do you think
i like it
the clouds seem to be dancing
can i take a walk in your garden
you can go anywhere you want
there is no barrier
you can even go to the sea
over that way on the other side of the dunes
but you did not answer my question
what did you want
nothing
i just wanted to meet you that is all
and now
and now what
I'd love to know who painted you

Secretive about his past speaks many languages pretends not to understand anything

yes
i think stupid college professor is just a front
i think he is a stupid international terrorist
Face facts Mary
Dick Solomon fits the classic profile of a serial killer
a serial killer
Moody high forehead
Lives in an old lady's attic
Only one piece of the puzzle missing your head in a box
Hey cutie

i saw you turn a man into a monkey
Actually it was a chimpanzee
and it never happened
that is it
no more covers
no more lies
i do not know who you are
i do not know what you are

Good bye Dick
Mary wait

Mary
i
Dick Solomon am an alien
from outer space
groans coughs
where am i
and what is going on
you lied so much you passed out
Mary it is true
i am the High Commander of an exploratory mission that came to Earth 6 years ago to study mankind
does your family know about this
we are not a family
we are a unit
Tommy is the information officer
Sally is the security officer
and Harry has an enormous transmitter in his head
oh that is impossible
Except for the Harry part
Open your mind
Think about everything you do not know about me
and then think about everything you do know
Think about how every single time something happens it is like i am learning it for the first time
like a child
Mary think about our entire 6 year relationship knowing that i am an alien
you are an alien
yes
Why did not i see this before
because you are only human
door opens
panting
Don
what is with the police tape surrounding your house
i am not in the mood for company
i am a coward
all right
now you listen to me Donald Leslie Orville
Ever since i have know you you have gone out there every day and done your job even though you are scared to death
there is only one word for that kind of coward
Brave
i never thought of that
Well think again
and you know what
now that you have been honest with yourself you have the power to be the man you have always wanted to be the man you deserve to be
the man
i fell in love with
i feel like i can go back out in the world and start again
i can always tape my soaps
Thank you Sally
my pleasure
now that is my boy
screams
what
uh did i poke you
no it is just cold against my skin
so check it out Doobie
i got two of everything
for the twins
i once dated twins
it was so confusing especially when they dress alike
Twins dress alike
Well these did
they were the Minnesota Twins
Woman
hello
oh
it is 7 00
that must be Samantha
she is the posh one
but i think she might be the most naughty
screams
screams
Sam
it is you
you are early
Well maybe a little bit
is that a problem
no
not at all
here
Let me show you around
this is the living room
this is the kitchen
and this is the bathroom
here ya go
Sam yelps
Why dontcha go in there
oh great
now i have to go to the bathroom
Dick
when you came to Earth was i your first
uh no
i was
but you were a very distant second
Aw
i can not believe i am
if i told my mother i was dating an alien it would kill her
Dick
Let's call her
no
no no no no
Mary no
oh i am sorry
it is a secret
i am just so excited
i have so many questions
Well go ahead
Did you build the pyramids
Only the one in Las Vegas
what about Easter Island
Easter Island was a practical joke that got out of hand
laughs
i can not believe my boyfriend's an alien
Dick on your planet how do you do it
Well it is it is similar to Earth
Typically you launch a protoplasm capsule into your partner's receptor port and then wait for a an impact summary
Take me spaceman
i am screwed
Sam's here early and her sister Samantha's due any minute
so you are gonna go outside and distract Samantha when she gets here
how can i do that
Well shiny objects usually work for me
laughs door opens
gasps
shrieks
Samantha
you are here too
Too
to eat in the kitchen where people always eat
not in the bathroom
where they hide
Stay calm
Harry is something wrong
no i am havin' a great time
and so are you
now why do not you just sit here and count to 100
no reason
Harry where are you going
to check on the ham
it is in the bathroom
it is an old family recipe
Sam quick you gotta get outta here
Harry i did not see anybody
that is because you missed her
now come on
i want you to go in the bathroom and sneak Sam out okay
i think the other one might be hotter anyway
Harry
yes
what is goin' on
Well nothing
Let's go eat
is not the ham in the bathroom
yeah that is right
knocking
who is that
it is the ham
knocking
it must be ready
Harry i know somebody's in there
Look
i got a confession to make
i made two dates tonight
you did
Who'd you make the other date with
oh i can not tell ya
it is too sick
hello
i wish you two all the luck in the world
Great
now i lost Sam and Samantha
they took the ham
i have listened to what you have had to say
i have processed it
i am not gonna change my mind
i am gonna kill Albright
but you can not
do not worry
i will use the second most pain free manner
i can think of
Sally she loves that we are aliens
and she loves the secret
she thinks it is sexy
Dick as Security Officer
i have to take care of all security breaches
any human who knows our true identity must die
now those are the rules and i am stickin' with'em
okay
Fine
you are right
okay that is very mature
Big news Don
there is something you should know about Sally
Tommy Harry and me
okay fine fine
i won't kill her
but this conversation is not over mister
Thank you
Sally i really took your advice to heart
so i went down to the station and i made some changes
you volunteered for the anti gang unit
i am opening a muffin shop
what
Don that is ridiculous
you were meant to be a cop
Only in your dreams
Whenever i was at work i was scared
but whenever i am around muffins not so much
Dick get in here and tell Don what you were gonna tell him
so it turns out that Sam and Samantha were the same person
Why are the crazy ones always attracted to me
i still can not believe Don traded in his badge for an apron and a whisk
i am just really worried he is giving up his calling
now that Mary knows about us we should invite her up here to muse with us about the earth
oh this day just keeps getting better and better
you know i will tell you something interesting about sounding like space signal
Incoming message from the Big Giant Head
the Big Giant Head sends congratulations on a job well done
Nice
and notice of your mission's imminent cancellation
Cancellation
an inter alien complaint has been lodged by Liam Neesom
as you know the use of a weapon against another alien is a mission violation
he was gonna turn us into chimps
he did it first
it doesn't matter who started it
the Big Giant Head is telling you
the mission is over
over
no
yes and that is final
you must leave by Saturday at midnight when your earth bodies will expire
Transmission ending in 3 2 1 sneezes
what happened
we have to go home
Closed Captioned by J R Media Services Inc
Burbank CA25 000
it is 6 am the temperature 66 F and we are getting some very worrying cables from Southeast Asia
Confirming that the Great Oriental Bank has had to close it is doors today following a crashing bankruptcy which left behind a jumble of victims among the savers who trusted this bank reputedly so strong in the international scene
WAlTING FOR THE MESSlAH their life time savings
they have been mentioned savers also from our country Argentina apparently also envolved in this dramatic situation which has plunged the markets in Southest Asia
into a state of great confusion
they will work some days and some days they will be laid off
how many will be jobless
Well in this case
i mean we can not predict a number
the Tokio exchange the domino effect the Euro the Yen all that shit just fucked us
Enthusiastic honest
what could you criticize about those close to you
nothing
you know who i mean by those close to you
yes
Mother father friends girlfriend
what skills did you develop in previous job
Skills the will to work
Your main defects
i am not good at sports
sometimes i am a little arrogant and i have a slight difficulty to express my thoughts
it is as if
i got false starts
Significant events in your life
Your worries a color your favourite season of the year and your expectations on this job
could you repeat the sequence
Just tell me the color
Blue
Blue
i also like blue
Doesn't score many points
Red is better
and the rest of the score
how did i do it
it was in China the domino effect
they gave me these bonds
they are worth nothing now but are guaranteed by the
Chinese state
it is over
it is over
i got fired
Business is not thriving
Dad lost it all when the bank closed but we pretend nothing's changed
Simon continues the cook Ramn does the dishes and i wait
Dad dad
yes
the savings certificate was it a lot
no not much
but it was everything
all we had
what are we going to do
not tell mother
that is all we can do
when the kidney doesn't work it is replaced by something like a filter
this is the arm a tiny hole is punched here and a nozzle brings out the dirty blood
this is the machine here the filth is stopped
another nozzle returns our cleansed blood
Just two tiny holes in the arm
Like making coffee
Exactly but the other way round
Mum is this temporary or for ever
Sarah this way
the doctors belive my mother is going to die
they do not get it
Obviously they never had a Jewish mother
she can not just go with all the things she is got to do
Buy my clothes the Tupperware meetings talk on the phone with her parents remembering everything anyway a lot of things
Mum can not go
what happened mum
do not Ariel
Your purse
Listen Ariel
Listen was dad inside that purse
was Estela inside that purse
no
Poor Estela
then there was nothing important in that purse
besides the money is safe
Come let's go shopping
Mum
this is my neighborhood
it is called Once
a very active noisy place where we the Jewish live surrounded by cloths and safety pylons
Bar Mitzba is a turning point in the life of a Jewish boy
it happens only once in a lifetime and it is the entry into the adult's world
into the world of responsabilities feeling part of this chain
Assume our role as a new link in the history of our people
it is a moment of celebration joy but when the party is over and there are only the dirty dishes and the leftovers that is the time for reflecting and the understanding the reaches of the commitment
that is why the record we keep of that moment will enable us to remember this pact in the future
I'ts the images of the people we love those we do not wich will remain in here for ever
this is not a Bar Mitzva
this is a wedding
do not worry Moshe
Basically it is the same system
here i have other samples
this is Feldman Dubcovsky
at the Ben Gurion club
it was a great party
Alright
Cotton is not it
no this is Shmate
Shmate
Original Yiddish
Typical adjective denoting bad quality in clothing
Congratulations
Please protect her in eternity under the wings of your deity
may her soul be an inseparable part of chain of life
may God allow her to rest in peace
may God bring peace to them and to all the bereaved of the Israeli congregation

Bye Elsa remember what i said
the night shift has some advantages
it makes you think
you do not have a mate talking about impossible sexual battles
you work in peace
the thing is staying awake
is that clear
in the morning when the janitors arrive and wet the floors then you can leave
we use initials here much faster that way
for example tell me your name
Ariel Goldstein
no not Goldstein
the initials
a G
anything wrong
you look worried
no it is only

Everything's there
Almost everything

Perichn
Christmas

Strange business
Gee

Pain

Interesting
i will try and find it
it is www world circumsized com
it is got a page in Spanish as well

Post production good evening Ariel

Yiddish
a language spoken by Jews all over the world
Ah Yiddish
you are also Jewish
no
but i am gay
we have a lot in common
Did she say gay or goy
anyway we got nothing in common
that is a myth
People think they cut a whole chunk off
but it is just a piece of skin good for nothing just like the appendix
and what do they do to women
nothing
they got nothing surplus
the foreskin is a good subject
it never falls
Thanks See you tomorrow
now she leaves walks goes away
she takes her scarf off her clothes and she goes to sleep
Plug it in
Like it
it is very bright
Higher Ramn higher
one two three testing
do you hear me Ramn
Ramn can you hear
it is like the Wailing Wall
but right here close by
when we reopen each bring his wish
i have already asked something
if you wish i will keep a space for you
i have seen naked women
i have seen Estela and my cousin
but together
i mean they can not get too far right
i have tried to imaglne how could it be
it is technically Impossible
Absurd
how
It'd be easier with a dick
are you sure
Practical simple everything's ready
i remember when i first went to bed with a boy
i saw him naked with a silly thing hanging and i thought
it will never work
however it did
so
so what
Did you enjoy it
you never told me
yes it was wonderful
i was worried about not getting pregnant about not making noise because mum was sleeping next door and about catching any disease
i was all the time thinkin where had i left my underwear
in the end it was like a gym lesson
do not worry
Your dad
now what
he is coming for Christmas
he is promised that for 10 years
Why would you believe him now
because i miss him
Let him come then
do not worry he won't flinch at having a gay daughter
yes but i am not gay
i am just with the person i love who happens to be a woman like me
and it makes no difference
Today you can be with me tomorrow with a blender then with a Pekingese or
yes with a man with a dick this size
what the fuck do you want Annie
i am not whoever i go to bed with the person i love or what i chose to do with my pussy
i will not turn into a militant of my clitoris
i do not know what you are looking for
it looks as if my love is not enough
it is not easy to sleep during the day
will you give me a hand
i will get some coffee
no coffee will make you impotent
Impotence heartburn lots of ailments
Let's go to eat
to eat
it is not a stain
it is a tear that never could come out
and you
i have no restrained tears
that
that is my third eye
it can not see well
it is crooked
and your dad
he died when i was five
that is not true he is very much alive
he will come to see me for Christmas as usual
you look alike we look alike
my mother died really died
after the funeral we got together at the restaurant eating eggs crying the telephone rang and someone named Santamara called
he asked for Sarah my mother and i said
the lady is not in
Luckily he did call back and we got together
Santamara it would be interesting to know him
I'd like to tell his story
a man with a very special job return identities
i do not think it is so poetic for him
Sticking his hands in trash cans can not be too nice
would not you like to work with me
Obviously she is in love
Why would she choose me
what do i have to do with the world she like so much
a TV star
the Streets of Santamara
i prefer the Identities of Santamara
i like the other one better the streets
yes it is more urban
what is her name
Laura
do not feel ashamed
how is it going
sometimes i think it is my imagination
sometimes i think she is waiting for me
i mean gestures provocation
the moment to leap
but i think i would not dare
you have to make them laugh
that is all
i am courting a beauty now
a woman my age
you met her in the street
no this is a fine lady
she has a home a job
a fine woman
and this woman
Elsa is she alone

Once upon a time there lived a gudgeon
his mother and father were clever so he grew up a very clever gudgeon
he started to think and he realized whenever he looked everywhere he was checkmated
Big fishes all around him and he is the smallest
any fish can swallow him but he can not swallow anyone
and he can not understand why to swallow anyone
the life all round is amazing and beautiful
so amazing that sometimes it is unbelieavable
Thanks god
it seems i am alive he told to himself and decided to dig a hole
so much fear he had suffered when he heard
Beware son
to live a life is not like to lick a spoon
Keep your eyes open
the Gudgeon was satisfied that he had beated the crafty designs of the enemies and survived
and he had a most alluring dream
the gudgeon took a deep breath and decided by the day he will sit in his hole and at night when everyone's asleep he will swim
and suddenly he wanted to strut around the whole river
Thank God
it seems i am alive
Ah what is gonna happen tomorrow
the Gudgeon never married and never had kids
although his father had a big family
the Gudgeon explained this in his own way
at that time you could easily live a life
the pikes were kinder and perches were not hungry for us fries
but now when fish in the rivers become extinct even gudgeons are in demand
no time to think about a family just to keep yourself alive
this little gudgeon was very patient
but here he grew bold and shouted to his offender
when will at last gudgeons recieve enough feed
because this way we can degenerate to a smelt
now if everybody was living like this wise gudgeon it would be so peaceful in the river
and the wise gudgeon now clearly realized that you need to spend your life so that noone ever notices you
this way he lived 100 years and more
no friends no relatives
he visited nobody nobody visited him
the gudgeon was pondering though he was wise and he thought
Thank god i am dying a natural death
like my mother and father
and he had a very last dream
this is for your senseless wise life said the pike
and long time these words were ringing in gudgeon's ears
what pleasures did he have
Did he comfort anyone
Did he give a good advice to anyone
Did he tell a kind word to anyone
who will remember his existence subs by Eus found at karagargaso gather around as i run it down and unraveI my pedigree
my father was a junkie
do not you never do this shit you hear me
this is bad shit
yeah OK
do not you never be Iike me aII right
do not do it
what you want for Christmas
i do not know
you do not know
Boy you better know what you want
else how do you expect to get what you want if you do not know what you want
I'II be right back
Daddy do not go
no man do not
Come on i am sorry boy
you know you are my main Iittle nigger
you go you go
Get out of here man
Give to the poor
Let's go come on
Hey
Merry God damn Christmas kid
you been a good boy huh
Murderer
do not teach my boy that fairy tale elf shit
Did you see
i am sorry
the money
my father when i saw him die Iike that saw him find his grave in the snow
i only had one thought
it was not going to happen to me
TeII me do you know the difference between a black man and a nigger
most niggers do not
next please
Good morning
have a seat
so teII me Officer Winston what is the difference between a black man and a nigger
who the fuck do you think you are talking to
Right
Thanks for coming in
so Officer Stevens teII me do you know the difference between a black man and a nigger
the nigger's the one that would even answer that question
most undercover cops do not know what they are doing because it is a day gig
i am Iooking for somebody who wiII go under and stay under six months a year five years
what does he have to do
Buy drugs seII drugs set up the people that i want to bust
no
he is a snitch
he is a drug dealer
he is a criminal he is a scumbag
but most importantly he is a scumbag for the right side
You'II be on Ioan to the DEA and you'II report directly to me
i have stayed away from this kind of stuff aII my Iife drugs and stuff
i have never even had a drink
i never have and i never wiIl
because your father was kiIled robbing a Iiquor store when you were ten years old
i am God
i know everything
Why did you join the force
because i wanted to be of some use to make a difference somehow
have you ever seen your psychologicaI profile
you score almost exactly Iike a criminal
Look at this
Resents authority
Rigid moraI code
but with no underlying system of values
Insufficiently developed sense of self
Look at aII the rage
Iook at aII the repressed violence
i am teIling you undercover aII your faults wiII become virtues
You'II be a star there John
You'II do a Iot more good there than in uniform
you wiII be of use
you wiII make a difference
those guys after work they went home to their wife and kids
then one day on the street they forgot where they were and now they are dead
but you'II never go home so you won't forget
because there is only one rule in this game John do not blow your cover
i did not want the assignment
i sat there the whole interview thinking that if i took it it would be the biggest mistake of my Iife
and i was right
i am Iooking for a room
so you see
that is what is wrong there is just no imagination these days
Hey bassino
that is Belinda Chacon and if you want my opinion you'II stay away from that bitch
if you want to get anywhere in drug enforcement do not bother with street dealers
you take one of them out there is ten more to take their place
Go after the big guys try to knock out the big networks
Felix Barbosa
he is Iike a middle IeveI executive
he supplies the guys who supply the guys who supply the street
he gets his stuff from the importer
Anton GaIlegos
GaIlegos is the number one importer in the West Coast
Forty percent of aII the drugs in Los Angeles go directly through this guy
Very cute
he is able to do this Iargely because his uncle
Hector Guzman is an influentiaI Latin American politician a self promoting duplicitous greasebaIl according to our friends at the State Department
he helps GaIlegos get the product into the country
are we going after him
uh weIl no not directly
he is too big
but if we can naiI the nephew maybe it'II smear the uncle hurt him back home politicaIly
that would be very good for you and me
that would get us friends in high places
but we want the uncle
we want Guzman
John Iisten
WiII you stay with me
one step at a time
you go for Barbosa and then GaIlegos nice and orderly
the beauty of that is it protects your ass
HoIlywood
the great thing about Iife on the street is you know how it is going to be
it is always the same
it is always getting worse
Eddie in his red caddy and his nice clothes that his mama must have bought him he supplied the street dealers
he was a crazy good natured desperate asshole with a Iife expectancy of about a half an hour
but people said he got his dope by way of Felix Barbosa so i had to get to him and through him while he was stiII around
Yo baby boy
what the fuck i teII you about being around here
they told me i had to
no that is sad sad but too fucking Iate
Hasta Ia vista motherfucker
that is cold shit man
Ashes to ashes dust to dust

Iowered IQ dyslexia God only knows what else
Maybe it goes to school but it can not Iearn

Delicioso
Felix Barbosa was a skinny fourteen year old
here he was at Iast
Anton GaIlegos a creep in a black cape
and now i began to wonder
Barbosa's death had gotten us here
Did i Iet David kiII him
Did i want him to
Felix owed me 1 800 000
when you kiIled him you bought his debt
now you owe it to me
you get to keep thirty percent same as he did
you have three days
how wiII we do that
David
i ought to kiII you
Everybody says i ought to kiII you
the only reason i Iet you Iive is if i can get something from you
we wiII start with this
I'd done it
I'd gotten to GaIlegos the number two man on Jerry's pyramid
where have you been man
i met with GaIlegos today
we can take him down tomorrow
Get in
you are coming in now
i am coming in where
you know what the fuck i am talking about
Your assignment is terminated
you violated a direct order to stay away from that bust
as a result a police informant is dead
that is not my fault
two officers were injured and a vice cop was murdered
i did not blow my cover
do not get smart with me you son of a bitch
you want to bring GaIlegos to trial
i got him
who gives a shit how i did it
Give me your gun
what the fuck's wrong with you
if i have to I'II put you in custody
now give me your fucking gun
you are protecting him right
you are protecting GaIlegos
this motherfucker
what is he the new Noriega
he helps you fight communists you Iet him bring in drugs to seII it to niggers and spics and you use me to do that shit
you violated orders
do not make a conspiracy of it
Just give me the gun
Talk to me man
what are you doing
TeII me what the fuck's going on
it is not me
it is the State Department
do not give me that shit
Remember the uncle Hector Guzman
WeIl things have changed
we Iike him now
we want him to run for president down there someday
Jerry i sold drugs
i watched people die and i did not do nothing
i kiIled people
you Iied to me
they Iied to me John
how naive can you get
are you so stupid you can not see that
you think i Iike this
John i am sorry huh
it is aII buIlshit
you know that
i know that
what the fuck am i going to do now
Hey they are bringing me to Washington
Come along
We'II have a budget
i did not get into this for that
Neither did i but that is aII there is
the spoils of war
you might as weII enjoy it
then i have been wasting my time with you
i can get more clout and money on the street than i can get foIlowing your ass to Washington
this whole fucking time
i am a cop pretending to be a drug dealer
i ain't nothing but a drug dealer pretending to be a cop
i ain't going to pretend no more Jerry
i quit
it is not that simple
you do not think so
you watch me
i quit
it is not that simple John
my first drink Jer
Shit ain't bad
so the whole game had been a joke a joke on me
i was a fool
I'd been turned out Iike a two doIlar ho
Used abused but with no towel and no kiss
never have never wiIl
you know the jungle creed say that the strongest feed on any prey it can and i was branded beast at every feast before i ever became a man
are you fucked up
we have been everywhere you told us Iooking for this money
we only got 1 1 miIlion of what
what do we owe GaIlegos
a miIlion eight
he is Iying
Barbosa barely owed him a mil
he is going to kiII you guys
Sit them down
Come show me
Come
AII right
it is not one eight
it is a miIlion one
now that is more than what he owed you
that is aII we are paying
Big brass baIls but if i say it is a miIlion eight then it is a miIlion eight so you owe me another seven hundred thousand doIlars which is already Iate so we add it with the interest and there are those Iittle penalties
so Iet's say a miIlion
is that OK
OK
that is fine
is that going to be OKwith you
because if it is not we wiII talk about it
it is fair
Things that get in the way of coIlecting my money
he was not going to Iet us Iive anyway huh
Let's go Iet's go
i am coming
you thought I'd Iet you Iive Iet you get away
i got you twice
where is it
no se
Even if we'd given him another miIlion he'd have kiIled us
i could teII by the Iook in his eyes and the smirk on his face so i got GaIlegos after aIl
despite Carver and despite the State Department
i got him
John Q HuIl the dealer not RusseII Stevens the cop
it was Iike Jerry had said aII my faults were becoming virtues and now that i had whacked GaIlegos there was no turning back
Motherfucker
we are in business David
it is aII right
there could be something Iike 100 miIlion bucks
if we take it half of Latin America's going to come after us
that is the idea David
you do not work for GaIlegos you work for Guzman right
this is what you are going to do
TeII him we got his money and we talk to him and nobody else
Entendes
i see
oh you flinching now huh
what
Hector Guzman goes fishing with George fucking Bush
he is going to give us money for synthetic drugs

what if i do not feeI good about it
can i show you something
she never made the plane
you son of a bitch
she is up on multiple counts of violating various state and federaI bank Iaws
if you badmouth us
I'II see that she gets convicted on aII of them and that the judge runs the terms consecutively
if you play baIl she walks
what do i have to say exactly
AII you have to do is speak highly of the operation and the DEA and aII the agents in it particularly me
i want it in writing
i want it signed by you and the prosecutor and my attorney approves every single word
Mr Stevens so what have you actuaIly accomplished with this vast expenditure of time money and violence
Madam chairman my assignment was to bring down Anton GaIlegos the chief supplier of cocaine to the West Coast
i did that
Mr Stevens whom do we have to thank for aII this
besides yourself or course
i had very Iittle to do with it
the true credit belongs to the agency in particular my superior officer Gerald Carver and his superiors
they designed the operation they gave me the inteIligence Iatitude and strategy to carry it out
if it was not for Mr Carver and his superiors
i would not have been able to do what i did
you consider the operation a success
Almost
Tape
what the heIl's he doing
what you are about to see is a videotape of Hector Guzman a diplomat to this country a very powerfuI and important Latin American politician and a friend of our president's
you got a problem Jerry
i do not know anything about it
DeaI with it
here you can see him meeting with drug dealers including myself
Iate Iast month in Los Angeles
for years Mr Guzman has been a conduit for his nephew Anton GaIlegos a major drug importer
this is slanderous and irresponsible
i want that tape seized now
i want that tape
i am sorry
Copies have already been distributed to the press
Let's go
Let's have some order here
Mr Stevens one question
Mr Guzman has been mentioned as a possible presidentiaI candidate for his own country
do you intend for these revelations to damage his politicaI career
i do not know anything about politics
what are your motives
Please Iet us through
you motherfucker
we had a deal
the deaI was he would not criticize the agency and he did not criticize the agency so back off
Go get the car Gopher
you and Jason took a heII of a Iot of money out of that van before you gave it to Guzman
how much was that exactly
Jerry what is the difference between a black man and a nigger
what
the nigger's the one that would even think about teIling you
you aII right
Put it down
Go wait with Betty
we took eleven miIlion in drug profits out of the van
the money doesn't know where it comes from but i do
if i keep it i am a criminal
if i give it to the government i am a fool
if i try and do some good with it maybe it just makes things worse
Either way I'II probably just wind up getting myself in more trouble
it is an impossible choice but in a way we aII have to make it
what would you doi am counting on you Aleksander
i will call you when it is done
Se dig for
Visa
hi
hello
you are looking at the work of an emerging terrorist organization the Beograd Faction
Yesterday at five o'clock they hit the Indonesian Embassy in Copenagen
it was their fourth major attack recently
and their first overtly political act
if that is in fact what it is
Looking at their files they haven't claimed any ideology
they have made no demands
something doesn't add up
Langley is desperate for intel on this group
to that end they placed an undercover agent within the organization
his name is Thomas Raimes
he specializes in prolonged deep cover work
he is been in place for months posing as an expert in forging counterfeiting
two weeks ago he warned of an attack
he never followed up with the details
he is missed meetings with his handler and hasn't notified headquarters
which means he was either caught or killed
in one of his last communications he was able to identify the leader a man named Milos Kradic
Echelon intercepts suggest Kradic has a meet tomorrow at a location in Amsterdam
Dixon Vaughn you will run surveillance
if Kradic shows up neutralize him and take him into custody
Sydney coordinate with Jack when he gets in
you will run the operations from here
Until then find out what other motives they could've had for hitting that embassy
OK that is it
Thank you
phone rings
hello
woman Nadia
Sophia
is that you
it is so good to hear your voice
Yours too
i am so surprised you are calling
it is been
a long time
yes
i am flying to Los Angeles
i was hoping we might catch up
I'd love to
Why do not i meet you at the airport
that would be wonderful
i arrive in the morning
OK
i will see you then
Sydney how long since you heard from Sophia
Nadia Like ten years
Sydney Why did she come now
i do not know
she did not say
are you sure you are OK with this
oh she can stay as long as she wants
Thanks
where else am i gonna hear embarrassing stories about you as a kid
are you OK
yeah i am fine
you do not seem very excited
i know
i am it is just
last time i saw her i was in jail
i do not want to be a disappointment to her
who knows if she will even recognize me
Sophia
i am sorry
i am so sorry
what happened
i did not have anywhere to go
it is so good to see you
over the last few weeks
i had the feeling that i was being watched
i kept seeing the same faces everywhere i went
then last night i came home early from work and they were in my house
as soon as i walked in they attacked me
what did they want
i do not know
Did they take anything
i honestly do not know
when i regained consciousness my house was ransacked and they were gone
i could not stay there
i am sorry i came here like this
it is OK
you did the right thing
we should let her get some sleep
yes
i am sorry we had to meet under these circumstances
you are family to Nadia which means you are family to me
i will see to it you are well taken care of
you have nothing to worry about from now on
Thank you
that woman took care of Nadia when i could not
i owe her
as soon as i get back i will reach our connections in Portugal
Whatever i can do
you need a ride
no thank you
OK
i will meet you there
that should take the edge off
it is less painful than the last few times
Glad to hear it
i have increased the dosage of lipoic acid
Sorry to say you may experience some increased side effects
it is not a cure but it should keep it at bay for a while
i have been looking into studies from the Institute of Radiology in Prague
Based on treatment in Chernobyl
it is apples and oranges Jack
we are not talking about alpha particles and beta particles gamma and neutron rays
the radiation you were exposed to when you walked into that reactor
well it is a different fruit altogether
then we will keep looking
20 years i have known you
you are not one iota less stubborn
how is Sydney
she is doing well
i remember when she was just starting school
where do the years go
Jack i have watched countless people die
had to look into my patients' eyes when i tell them what they have is terminal
you know that stuff about laughter being the best medicine it is a load of bunk
i assume you have a point
a clean conscience that is a treatment i can stand behind
we know how this is going to end
we can filter your blood till the cows come home but there is no changing the outcome
Clear your conscience Jack
that would take another lifetime at least
i am not suggesting you write your memoirs
although i am sure they would make a hell of a read
Start small
Talk to your daughter
she is better off not knowing
Jack these secrets you are keeping they are not yours to keep
we have been waiting over an hour
Think Kradic's gonna show
i hope so
do you have history with the target
i knew the undercover agent Raimes
from Langley
we were in the corps together
Force recon
Toughest guy in our platoon
Didrt think the bullet was made that could take him down
we do not know that he is dead
he could have been captured
if Raimes were alive he would've made contact
OK there is Kradic
there is another guy there
Brown jacket
you see him
it is Raimes
Vaughn do you think he is gone rogue
Sophia you have grown into a beautiful woman
so different from the girl i once knew
you were so angry then
i know it is hard to believe at least it is for me but i have a home now
a family
i finally feel like i belong somewhere
Your father's a good man
i can tell
you should rest now
i will be by tonight to check on you
Nadia wait
it is St Marcos
the orphanage's namesake
my happiest times were there watching over you girls
i want you to have it
i can not
Please
it is my way of thanking you for taking care of me
Whoa
oh hey
hi
Sorry Mr Sloane
i was testing out a mod on a virtual imager and you looked a little freaky
there is a latent fingerprint in here
i want everything on the person it belongs to
and i want it kept between us
yeah sure
no problem
Thank you
Dad Dixon and Vaughn called in
they found Raimes
he is alive
he is traveling with Kradic
have our team shadow Raimes
the second he is alone question him
i want to know why he hasn't contacted Langley
i will let them know
Dad
Let me know when Dixon and Vaughn have secured Raimes
i will keep you posted
got the target
he just ordered a whiskey straight up
Dixon OK
Go for it
oh i am sorry i did not see you there
Cheers
we are in Amsterdam
this is the best place we can find
no if i chose to meet we'd be in a park or near a beautiful canal
where are you going
where are you going
last time i saw you like this was in a bar in Baghdad
Marcus
what are you doing here
Langley assumed you were compromised
what is going on
the embassy bombing
you warned of an attack in Denmark two weeks ago then nothing
Why did not you send a warning the bomb would go off
i will fill out a report later
i gotta get out there
Kradic is meeting an associate
then talk fast
we need answers
you do not understand
so explain it to us
Why haven't you checked in
Kradic is paranoid
if i radioed
there are other ways
i have to report in Thom
and right now we are looking at two scenarios
Either you blew your intel or you have gone over
which is it
you think i sold out
you tell us
i had the intel but if i warned Langley Kradic would've known we were onto him
so you decided to let 15 people die
i had my reasons
Dixon we are listening
he is after a new weapon developed by the Indonesians
it is a water contaminant
it can wipe out whole ecosystems
Kradic has a line on it
the bombing was crucial to acquiring the weapon
it was a handful of lives against a half a million
that is not your call to make
you werert there
Look if i am not back in a few minutes Kradic is gonna know something's wrong
yes 15 people died but if we do not recover that weapon it will be hundreds of thousands
so are you gonna let me walk out that door or what
Your call Marcus
Kradic knew the Indonesians developed a sample but he did not know where
so he bombed the embassy as cover for the intel theft
Protocol dictates that if a bomb goes off confidential intelligence is transferred to off site servers
the explosion triggered that
he must have been prepared to intercept the data
the location must have been in those files
he knows where it is and now he is putting together a team to steal it
Indonesian officials deny their intelligence was compromised
what else could they say
if they admit developing it they'd be violating treaties
we are talking in circles
the only option is to make Kradic lead us to the weapon
we can take him out before he gets to use it
Dixon what is your tactical assessment
Considering the situation i think our best bet is to keep Agent Raimes in the field
Agreed
you and Vaughn will shadow
Dixon Copy that
Go check on Raimes
Make sure he is OK
we will outfit you for comms
no
Kradic has surveillance detection
if i show up wired i will light up like a Christmas tree
we will modify the comms
Spread spectrum burst transmitters should be beyond him
it will take us a few minutes
i will brush past you with them
Fine i will meet you at the bar in ten minutes
Wait
this meet who is it
a hacker
Linus Halsey
Why
shouts in Danish
does he know this hacker face to face
you are thinking of switching him out
you stand a better chance with another man on the inside
Fine but you better hurry
he will be here in one hour
Hey
what the hell
where did you go
Let me tell you something
Whiskey on an empty stomach not good
is he pushing you around
he is waiting
you are like a little girl
Come on let's go
i will start with Langley see if they have a file on Halsey
if there is a photo we can run it through Interpol's biometric scan
Make it fast
we do not have much time
Mr Sloane sir
Mr
here is that background check you asked me to run
Sophia Vargas
you actually probably just wanna skip to the last page
Thank you Marshall
Sure
i found the hacker Halsey
he was an MlT graduate with a degree in nonlinear cryptoalgorithms and stochastic systems analysis because if they called it code breaking they could not charge 30 grand tuition
i am linked with Amsterdam's surveillance network
i am checking the database for hotel reservations
got him
Hotel Ruisseau
it is just a few blocks over from where they are
got eyes on Halsey
Dixon OK
when you have got him i will head inside
what is going on
Dixon coming your way
car horn
Wat doe je nou
i would've had him
i know
Sydney Hey
Good work on Hotel Ruisseau
they caught Halsey
Thanks
we aim to please
you are in a good mood
yeah i guess so
so things went well with Sophia
yeah
i have missed her so much
it is been a long time
i was so different back then
you would not have known me
i bet i would've
no
i was crazy wild
i do not know what she saw in me
she was always telling me i was her special one
for years after i left the orphanage that was the only thing i could hang on to
i knew someone somewhere believed in me
you are lucky to have a person like that
yeah
Why did you really come here
Tell me
i do not know what you mean
i know all about Jos Pedraza
i know the Argentine police found his body
i know they found a fingerprint
but they could not find a match
i did
he was hurting my girls
and i was the one who hired him to tend the grounds
i did not realize
Did he hurt Nadia
he tried
i did not give him the second chance
i know what i did was wrong but they were my children
yeah
i would've done the same thing
Still that doesn't answer my question
all i ever wanted was to protect Nadia
when she was brought to me as a baby she was in danger
i changed her last name to Santos so nobody could find her
the men who attacked me in Lisbon they werert after me
they were after Nadia
they wanted to know what name i had given her
and what did you tell them
nothing
Why did not you tell Nadia
when i saw her with her sister with you
she deserves the happiness she is found here
i could not bring back all that pain to her life
do not worry
now i can take care of her
how can you be sure
because i know who is after my child
you wanted to show me something
yeah hey Syd
Check this out
now this is one nanogram of Hydrosek which is one billionth of a gram in a 500ml beaker of water
According to my simulation the toxin actually feeds off the water
one gram of Hydrosek Lake Michigan turns into sludge
it is incredible really you know
in a Dr Evil sort of way
what would it take to manufacture this
Level four biohazard containment
and a massive cooling system which should narrow down possible locations
Give me a couple of hours
what is this
huh
uh
you know it is just a copy of some research i am doing for Mr Sloane
it is not
Dammit
what the hell are you thinking
i am sure you mean that in the most polite way
Using ClA resources to check up on Sophia
i was merely being cautious
i do not understand this but Nadia believes in you
Somehow you have earned her trust
every time you lie to her you break that bond
i want you to understand i am not telling you this out of concern for you only my sister
Nobody reads the paper anymore
there is too much tragedy in the world
beeping
Clean
Kradic have a seat
Your reputation precedes you Mr Halsey
you are too kind
Temperamental arrogant vindictive violent vain petty and deceitful
you are forgetting talented
brilliant and easy on the eye
there is that
you are supposed to be brilliant
they say you are the best hacker in the EU
that is the rep
but what went wrong on the Kroner job
Kroner job
what happened
Petty who the hell's that son of a bitch to call me petty
you know you can go f
oh God
nothing went wrong
then why does he hate you so much
i finished the job as agreed
Perfectly i may add
Listen to me you son of a bitch i am not going to let you hang my partner out to dry
that son of a bitch shorted me ten grand
Kroner stiffed him 10 000 euros
Kroner forgot to pay my 10 000 euros
that doesn't explain why he hates you
you still have three rings left
that is in one ear
what happened
after he stiffed me Vaughn he hacked his card to buy hookers i hacked into his credit card account charged it exactly 10 000 euros to several young ladies in the red light district then sent the bills to his wife
yes i did
we leave in an hour
Aleksander tell the team to meet us at Teuge airfield
you wanted to see me
i was thinking the embassy transmission that Kradic intercepted
the network tap he installed would've had to be physically placed on the premises
i do not follow
it would be risky to retrieve it afterwards so we can assume it stores the information
which means we might be able to access it remotely and download the same intel Kradic got off it
this is assuming the Indonesians haven't already located it and removed the tap
it is won'th a shot
i will get Marshall right on it
Decades of research went into the development of this little marvel and you yank it out with a letter opener
what are you talking about
you do not have the faintest
i implanted it to regulate the medication in your bloodstream
i explained the entire procedure to you
you did
i did
i have no memory of this
Well we talked about the fact that memory loss could be a side effect
i even implanted a second one in your calf
you do not remember that either do you
my position
my job this side effect is unacceptable
i can adjust the medication
but your condition is progressing quicker than i had anticipated
have you thought any more about what we discussed
about Sydney
Sydney has had to face so many things in her life too many for someone so young
and now given my condition i do not want to burden her
it is not fair
Honesty
that is fair
you won't always be around to protect her Jack
she has to know the truth before it is too late
you disagree with my decision
the embassy
i wasrt there
i was boxed in
so i made a call
Did some civilians die
yes
would i do it again
Absolutely
they are sacrifices we have to make
they are casualties in the business that we are in
you disappoint me Marcus
there was a time you understood that
that was a long time ago
Things are different
what happened
you get religion
i had that
no i got married
had kids
it changes a man
Hm
you mean it softens
i mean it deepens
Gives a man perspective
Maybe we need men who can make the hard call weigh the many against the few
i just know that every time i think of those 15 people at the embassy it weighs on me
how many kids you got
uh a daughter Robin and a son Steven
and the lucky lady
my wife was killed a few years ago
what you would call a casualty of the business we are in
Make sure that plane's ready to go
i hope it is warm where we are going
this weather's killing me
we are 15 minutes behind schedule
we will have to make it up in the air
Vaughn just checked in
Kradic's men just arrived at Teuge airfield
Marshall was able to run a probe at the Indonesian embassy
Turns out my father was right
we got a source on Hydrosek
it is in a manufacturing plant in Peru
Kradic beat us to it
he must have had a team in place
Four hours ago there was a fire in one of the research labs
our theory is Kradic's men caused the accident to steal the Hydrosek
which fits their MO using disaster to achieve their operational objectives
Well the big question is since they have it where do they plan to use it
it is likely Kradic will set up a rendezvous with the heist team
our best course of action would still be to keep Dixon in play
that is it
something else Jack
i know we agreed to keep this between ourselves but the time has arrived
Personal considerations have been weighing on me Arvin
we need to tell them the truth
yes i know
you are right
i am afraid that Nadia's already in danger
Fully fueled and ready to take us over the border
Get the gear
Let's move
i am in place
man Go ahead
beeping
Kradic has six team members
they are en route to the plane
man Agent Dixon is still embedded
Securely
whispers
Hey
what is going on
Outrigger
i am in position
i have a better question
which one of you two is Agent Dixon
Milos come on
Put the gun down
Take it easy
Enough
Aleksander intercepted a transmission
Transmission
you are just being paranoid
i know one of you is an agent
do you have a weapon
Come on
Let's talk this thing through
we are not doing anything till i find out the truth
i sensed something was wrong
no no
you are wrong
you know my reputation
you checked out the Kroner job
i should have trusted my instincts
now see this is insane
i am not an agent
Take it easy
who do you work for
ClA
Mossad
Man what are you talking about
Milos nobody here is an agent
OK
then you leave me little choice
i will have to kill both of you
which one of you would like to die first
Nobody's got to die
we are all on the same side here
Everybody just needs to calm down
Lower your guns
OK
Kill both of them
Enough
Outrigger do not shoot Kradic
we need him to lead us to the Hydrosek
Let me finish this
Get on your knees
this is how you deal with traitors
what you got to say now Agent Dixon
Dixon so Dixon any last words
Hey
Casualty of the business i am in
he is giving us an out
he is sacrificing himself to save the mission
Shoot him
Vaughn do it
we have business to do
we need to get out of here before this guy's backup shows
you are welcome
Let's go
this is Vaughn code alpha five zero niner Charlie request authorization for a code four medevac
we have an agent down
Vaughn just reported in
Raimes has been medevacked
he is critical but stable
they say the shot did not hit any vital organs
Dixon saved his life
he just boarded the plane with Kradic
here is the tail number
i will put in a call to Eurocontrol see if we can track it
i think i might be able to triangulate Dixors signal using one of NSA's comm sats
Excuse me do you have a minute
what is this about
Sloane Please come in
there is something you have the right to know
it concerns your mother's sister
Katya
Elena
she was one of the KGB's foremost assassins responsible for the murders of diplomats and politicians throughout Eastern Europe
in the course of her work she earned a reputation for being the cruelest of the Derevko women
Why are you telling us this now
Almost 30 years ago Elena disappeared
it was rumored that she had a falling out with Irina
Elena severed all ties with the KGB as well as her family
both the ClA and KGB tried to find her but to no avail
Even Irina could not locate her
but you found something
i received a message about a year ago
it led me to one of Elena's safe houses in Warsaw
inside we found this
it is me in college
this is my old apartment in Argentina
my grad school transcripts
Nadia i was nine here
Jack Given what is here we assume she is been surveilling you for at least a decade
we can also assume that she is responsible for the attack on Sophia
Why
what does she want from us
Sloane i do not know
we are doing everything we can to find out
Jack we have pored over all the recovered files
it is me
the plane is in the air
do we know where they are headed
i will contact you once i have their final destination
i will be waiting
i won't let you down
Elena
Sydney do you have any idea where Elena is
Sloane at this point
she could be anywhere

BRUTALlTY IN STONE
Nuremberg Rally grounds
Only the most feeble mind sees revolution only in terms of destruction
we have seen the contrary

Motifs on the Rally grounds
Hitler's speech met with wild applause
the Reich Symphony Orchestra closed the rally with the 4th movement of Brahms' C minor symphony
Alfred Rosenberg then spoke the closing words
Sieg
Heil
from the memories of the Auschwitz commandant
Rudolf Hss
in early 1942 the first transports arrived from upper Silesia
they were all to be destroyed
at first the went calmly into the rooms in which they were to be disinfected until some became suspicious and spoke of suffocation and death
then a kind of panic ensued
the ones standing outside were quickly herded into the chambers and the doors were bolted shut
in the next transport the restless ones were rooted out and not let out of sight
if disorder was noticed the agitators were quietly led behind the building and shot with a small calibre weapon
many women hid their infants in the piles of clothes
the Special Unit squads watched particularly closely and prevailed on the women until they took the children with them
the burning was done at night to avoid stopping the next transport
the timetable of each transport which was decided at the Reich transport ministry had to be strictly adhered to in order to avoid congestion on the relevant train lines

Construction ceased during the war

Sketches made by Hitler
Images of the future
Reshaping German cities
Round table with Hitler 8 June 1942
Transcript
the people of continental Europe must adopt Germanic thinking
to promote this the city of Berlin should be re named'Germania'
this will create a major impression
the name'Germania' for the Reich capital city in its new form fosters a feeling of unity between all Germanic peoples and the capital
the renaming of Berlin poses no technical problems as demonstrated by the renaming of Lodz as Litzmannstadt
Fhrer's order from 20 August 1943
i need 1 million dwellings for bombed out citizens
i envisage a living area of about 3 by 4 metres
the construction materials are unimportant to me
i can imagine mud huts or holes in the ground simply covered with planks
Houses should be detached built on allotments echoing towns and villages
Hidden under trees on city outskirts close to caves or air raid shelters and so forth
from the BDM songbook
we maidens sing published by the Reich Youth Authority
Song of the Gueux
now brave sword serve your lord keep your word cast to earth the lion fierce that will us pierce and the bloodthirsty hordes
may that breed's blood spray
Approach cowardly knaves over debris and corpses

Sathya
Make her say i love you to you

when Ravana took Sita away we call him a demon
when Sri Krishna took Rukmani we call him God
one is a villain and another is a hero
what would you want to become
Hero or villain
no
Listen to me
Brother you have 11 more days foryour marriage
Make Sathya say i love you to you
Only afterthat you must marry her
Only then you are a Hero
what are you doing with him
the game has just begun
you marriage is just 10 days away
or else i would've scald you
Mother
Look she is arrogant and doesn't listen to me
it is wrong
Sathya is not Sita in custody
she is my queen
she will eat what she likes wears what she wants and will live her life as she likes
all these days you did everything for me my happiness
from today onwards do everything for my Sathya
no more gun shots in this house
Sathya is like a rose
you will die if she is unhappy
Take this tiger away
Sathya hates it
i am scared that you might win the bet
i do not understand your concept
this is my concept
Ride on tiger's back
Tolly 2 Bolly

Fall in love even when the world is against you
Tolly 2 Bolly

it is a sweet game of lips
Actually game of waist curves
Silent game of marriage
a game of heart that never changes
Tolly 2 Bolly
Even if there is no sun
Even if there are no rains it is a game where two souls are engulfed by love
Even if it night hasn't fallen
Even if moon hasn't appeared
it is a game of bed where we cover each other in love
Shit

Let's show their horoscopes to a good astrologer

Why do not you do it instead of me
i will do it sir i will get the best astrologer in the state
Greetings Guruji

not a real marriage
a dummy marriage
Fummy marriage
Why are you so surprised
was not Gandhari married to a donkey
Recently we read about Aishwarya Rai married to a neem tree
lf she is married to another man the flaw will be removed
then get her married to your son at the fixed time
it may appear strange but there is no other way
Trust me
nothing son we were just discussing
we are not planning anything behind your back
Fo you believe this
i believe it brother
but it must be done secretly without a soul knowing about it
Find a trustworthy man and marry herto him
who can be trustworthy than you

Brother

i will talk to her
what
you said dummy marriage to them will you tell the truth to me
our marriage is real

can you get two into one suit
for what mate
Fun
you feel lonely in here
Looks like TV to me
what are you thinking
Seven across
Turncoats for the opera
Andy
Warning order
Eight man patrol you command Ray will be 2 i c
you will be cutting a communications line
no move for three days
Briefing at 0800 tomorrow
okay boss
it is not too clever staying up here
i do not want to lose you in some bone incident
OK let's get on with it
as you know your task is against Scud
Ground
Northwest of Baghdad
Your area of concern will be this northern main supply route
the Scuds landing in Israel are causing the alliance problems
two nights ago the Israeli air force was in the air waiting to attack targets inside Iraq
if Israeljoins in the war the alliance with the Arab states will crumble which of course is what Iraq wants
but if the Scud attacks on Israel do not stop within two weeks
Israel willjoin the war
we are not concerned about the fixed silos
Air strikes are taking care of those
the mobile launchers are a different matter
they are almost impossible to locate but they have one weakness
to programme in their targets they need assistance from Baghdad
this information is fed through fibre optic cables buried along the MSRs between Baghdad and the border towns
Cut those cables and they can not fly
Mission in two parts
one locate and destroy the fibre optic cable along the northern MSR two destroy mobile Scud
Repeat
one locate and destroy the fibre optic cable along the northern MSR two destroy mobile Scud
any questions
this terrain's crap
it is like a billiard table
how the hell are we going to find a hide in that
Maps
one in a million
Air navigation otherwise jack shit
if we get better they are yours
Shit
Wind your neck in Chris
this is what it is all about mate
Getting on with what you have got
so how are we getting in
there is no point taking vehicles
We'lljust stick out like a bulldog's bo ilo cks
Looks like a heli drop off
Give Harry and his crew a warning order
if we are going to find the cable we have to hit the MSR at its narrowest
that will be at a bend
Everybody cuts corners what about here
should not be any military activity whatsoever
Just be aware of the airfield in the southwest
no population
Looks good to me
Weather
much like a spring day in the UK
are the cables above ground or buried in pipes
do not know yet
we are waiting for more intelligence
will we need to use plastic explosives or do we give them a tap with a hammer
a boy in D Squadron used to lay fibre optics for a telecom company
i will see if he knows the score
Once we cut the lines someone will renew them
Exactly
if you can take them out it will slow down the repair time
Great
we will be operating here around 178K from the Syrian border
it is more than twice that far to Saudi
we will infill by heli
our drop off point being around 20K south of the MSR
from there move north to the MSR and find a hide in the area of this bend
Once in position find a cable and place the charges on staggered timings along a 3 4K length
if we get into any shit we call AWACS on the TACBEs
Get some air support while we wait for the heli pick up
if that doesn't happen tab to Syria
OK
what do you want TACBEs for
to order pizza
i need eight
Eight
you work in pairs do not you
OK four
Four TACBEs
they are to call in air support you understand
yeah
they are not for any other purpose
Right
what is this
that is a shiny thing
but i want one
you do not know what it does
as much link as we can carry for the Minimis and 5 56 for the 203s
what is your score with the 203 bombs and claymores
are you out of your skulls
the Regiment hasn't been together since World War Il
we are not scaled up for this
we are skint
whose is all this
it is a and D Squadrons'
we are operational in three days
so are they
you do not even have a job yet
Why bring us out if you haven't got any kit
Ray find some claymores and 203 bombs and take Chris with you
Cyril have a word with the other squadrons
See if you can get some gear
Ha
Dearest Jilly
if you are reading this i am dead
do not mope around
Get the insurance money and have a good time
PS do not forget 500 pounds is for the next squadron piss up
PPS i love you
are those the TACBEs
yeah
there is only one between two
have you tested the 319
no i will test it tomorrow
we have got our call sign Bravo two Zero
Sounds good to me
i like the easy to remember ones
Doesn't get any easier does it
no
what is that shiny thing
it is a SatNav
Put it on the list mate
Mark can have it
yeah
Well seeing as you have got no brew left i am off
Dearest Kate
my dearest dearest shiny thing
this is a letter i have never wanted to write
or you to read
here we check zeroed the Minimis and 203s
Weapons are just a tool
so long as they go bang and hit what you are aiming at that will do
Nice to have known you wankers
and you dickheads
the kit's divided equally so if anything goes wrong any two of us can carry out the task with some success
we only took the essentials but even that added up to 209lbs each the weight of a 15 stone man
how does it fee l
Bloody hell
how far have we got to tab with this
Right gents
Listen up
Sort out your kit and bag it up
next of kin one bag
Squadron another
Remember to label which is which
do not want your parents knowing you wear stockings and suspenders every chance you get do we
last Supper's around six
we might be getting some fresh in especially for you
Why do not we stuff them all in bin liners and take them with us
we are not a bunch of new age trave ile rs
it is always a question of style with you
you are what you wear
and what you carry
everything goes into the bergens except for the NBC kit which in deference to Chris we will carry in these designer sandbags
Right anything we have forgotten
Aye
Cover story
there is a high chance of dipping out on this one
the obvious one is pilot rescue
we are a search team looking for downed pilots
and our own heli went down
Sounds good
you want a piccie
yeah might as well
Watch it watch it
you got the shiny thing
no Chris
Leave that
Let the loadies do that the lazy bastards
i am going for a piss
for my parents for Jilly for Kate when she is 15 and one for you
Tossers

Scud
Get a fix on those positions
Chris
Get the rest of them in
it was over a two hour hike to the MSR the main supply route
the danger of finding a hide out in pitch black is that at first light you could find yourself in a housing estate
the MSR was not a road like the M1 but a white strip of sunbaked sand
i saw the junction boxes straight away
that gave us the landline
but we had a problem
Give us a hand mate
it is going to be a squirty one
there is a battery of S60s right on our doorstep
we will have to move
now
no we will wait till dark
Good news is i have located a landline
any joy Baz
no
no problem
Lost comms plan comes into effect as of noon
the heli will meet us tonight with a new one

of course we have captured the other members of your group
what i need to know now Andy
are you the same group that was discovered three days ago
i am trying to help you Andy
i do not understand
i am trying to help but you are confusing me
i do not know jack shit
have you eaten recently
no
so Andy
what was your unit doing in this part of the world
Israeli British doesn't matter much to me
for now
however both countries would not send men who know jack shit into their enemy's territory
you are special forces Andy
i understand that you are still doing your duty and you must understand that i have to do mine
so what was your task Andy
Please do not insult me
i do not even
i do not even know where i am
the officers just order us about they do not tell us anything
i hate the army
they did not tell me i would have to do things like this
i mean i do not even know why we are at war
do you know who the White Socks are Andy
no
they are our secret police and their methods are far more brutal than ours
so i will ask you again
what is your unit and what were you doing in northern Iraq
if you answer me truthfully i will see what i can do to protect you
there is nothing more i can do to help you
Whoever your God is you will need him now
this is fucking outrageous

you are not helping us at all Andy
Tell me the plans of the Israelis Andy
i have told you i am not an Israeli

Ding
Andy

how
because i have a foreskin

a foreskin
Jews are circumcised it is part of their religion
Let me show you
See
Foreskin
i pulled as hard as i could which was difficult due to the cold
so Andy
now you will tell me huh
what is your mission and what else are the British planning to do
we might be captured but we still had a job to do
the Regiment needed time to carry out damage limitation
they had to assume the worst
that we'd been captured and told the Iraqis everything
0ther operations would have to be cancelled or changed
Queen and Country that is bullshit
shall we start again Andy
no
so Andy
Tell us
i am a member of a search and rescue team
and what do you do Andy
we rescue downed pilots
i am a medic
Medic
and what was your mission on this occasion
i do not know
the officer knew
they operate on a need to know basis
they do not tell us anything just to get on the heli
the helicopter
Good Andy
now you will eat
then we will talk some more
Thank you
and my friend
yes yes
but first you will sign a paper for the Red Cross
so they know you are all right
i can not
the army will punish me if you ever send me home
i tried to find God
i begged him to help us and said as much of the Lord's Prayer as i could remember
nothing happened
Manchester United win very good team

T O S C a Tosca
you and your friends will not last much longer
we have others in the hospital you know that Andy
Look you are the senior rank here huh
no one knows you are alive
we can let you die and no one would know
Your government they do not care about you
to them you are just a tool to be used
Andy if you will not tell me who you are and what you are doing we will simply let the others die
Think about it Andy
GUARDS
you bad boy Dinger
Bad boy
this was not a film where the actor sticks out his chest and shouts
never
this was real We'd all fulfilled our obligations to operational security
it was now time to fulfil our obligations to each other very bad boy
this is disgusting
Why did you do that
the window was open so i threw it out
i opened the window because those fags are killing me
Sorry
i see shit and have to react
what is this
Jam
do not even think about it
do not
Jam again
i am closing the window
Clash Sex Pistols Showaddywaddy
that is not mine
Sorry your whole tape co ile ction is contaminated
Unbelievable
COP
a what
Close Observation Platoon
every infantry unit has one
we closely observe what is going on
in this case it was the MSR
MS R the Main Supply Route
we had to report on movements there
it was just a patrol put together for the job
Tell me what happened
a shepherd walked into our position so we had to get out
so you headed north
yeah for Syria
it was the only way out
how did you get in
a helicopter
Show me
what i told them was a good story and almost true
i simply left out words like Scud and the Regiment
i had nothing to lose
Chances were we were dead anyway
it was now a question of waiting to see if they believed me
here
they let me be for the next few days just working on Dinger and Stan
they wanted to confirm my story
i would soon find out if it had worked out or not
i was not afraid i was depressed
i thought of Jilly and Kate not even knowing if i was alive or dead
if they were going to do it let's just crack on and make it quick
Ray's bloody dead
God knows where Stan is
no bloody comms no decent maps no bloody backup
they can not even get the weather right
and all my sweets are green
Green for Christ's sake
i hate bloody green
Back in Rhodesia there is a tree ca ile d morula tree
the next few days were relatively happy
all we could do was talk about families life and each other
here was Dinger on God
i do not believe in the old bastard
0n his family
we had the most God awful row the night before we left
Still hurts when i think about it
0n me
Henry vill that is who you are
31 and already you have got three wives
what is your excuse
Adoption mate
never knew my mother
that explains everything does it
Your taste in music
Your appalling clothes
Why did you join the army
what
Why did you join the army
to keep out of trouble
you thought if you joined there'd be no more trouble
Best thing i ever did
never been in trouble since
what the bloody hell do you call this
he is crazy like a fool
what about Daddy Cool
Daddy Daddy Cool
Daddy Daddy Cool
he is crazy like a fool
what about Daddy Cool
Hands Andy
Andy
do you like Michael Jackson
yeah i do
Did you know i sing in a group here in the city
Play every Saturday night
Play the Meridien Hotel
no i do not believe you
Why
do not you like my voice
Daddy Daddy Cool
will you show me London after the war
yeah sure
Andy i love you
do you love me
yes Jeral i love you
Hands Andy
i am pissed off sucking up to that little wanker for your fags
i will never divulge what you two get up to
i licked shit off my hands for them
Ah quit honking
i am saving one for the firing squad
can not be long now
do you really think it is going to be like Breaker Morant
Dawn sky chaplain last fag instead of bend over bang straight into the bin liner
we weren't shot
not that week not the following
Apart from the chance of being blown apart by the bombs falling on the city we slowly began to believe that we might just get out in one piece
Reports in from Syria inform us that a British soldier crossed the border in the area where you were captured
they say in Damascus that he is SAS
are they treating you well
oh
for you
Well done Chris
Well done
but they are all green
Stan
Dinger
you are going home
not Andy
not Andy
not Andy
do not worry we will get you out of here
i will call Jilly mate
here catch
this was the worst time for me
Why had they kept me behind except to shoot me
Dying did not worry me but I'd taken it for granted that we were going to go together
i kept seeing my own funeral in Hereford with Dinger smoking all the way through the service
when a colonel had said what a good soldier I'd been
Dinger would have shouted
Wanker
then they would've drunk the 500 pounds of booze
i paid for the last piss up
and then i got to thinking about Kate and by first light she'd made me feel more composed
NEWSREADER
the Iraqi soldiers seemed to deserve pity rather than anger
200 000 of them gave themselves up
all they want to do is go home to their families
they are war weary and have no spirit left for the battle
the road north from Kuwait to the Iraqi port of Basra showed the cruel reality
the highway littered with the burnt out smashed remains of vehicles the Iraqis stole in Kuwait
Saddam promised them glory but they have lost it instead
as far as i am concerned it is over
Saddam Hussein had better know it is over
if Saddam makes the mistake of starting it again then he is going to have a lot more trouble than he has in Iraq right now

i got shot mate
in my foot
next thing they handcuffed me to a bed and left me to rot
Mark
can you see it
what
my foot mate
how can i miss it
it is the size of a marrow
one thing that is bugged me ever since we landed in Saudi
yeah
the piece of breeze block
yeah
the one in my bergen
yeah
Did you have anything to do with it
here
it is my sweet
what colour is it mate
it was green but i guess you can not have everything
Back in the UK we had an outrageous piss up
then the psychiatrist turned up to test us
looking for post traumatic stress disorder
it turned out they were more strung out than we were
War is barbaric but if you think this is the bit where i say
i want to spend the rest of my days hugging trees do not hold your breath
hi
hi
we are soldiers
it is my profession and i am proud of it
Nobody said you had to be crap at it
as for the men who tortured us they had a job to do as well
it is just that some of them enjoyed it a bit too much
if i met any of them in the street tomorrow
and thought i could get away with it
I'd slot themNO TRESPASSlNG
in the main hall in Nakano Shrine beneath the seventh tatami mat from the inner right side is the clan's hidden meeting room
i see
so that is what it is
that is my boy
Your father only talks about you
i wonder what kind of things Father was saying to Mother
if you wish to kill me resent me hate me
Brother
no matter what darkness may await me if it means killing you i will meet it head on
i will obtain that power no matter what
i obtained power and hatred and now i am here
Itachi
this is where you will die
by my hands
the End
now
as you wished i will recreate
your death
a jutsu which like Amaterasu cannot be evaded
what kind of jutsu is it
i get it
that is what Sasuke's Fire Style Jutsu was for earlier
what do you mean
the target of that Fire Style attack was never Itachi to begin with
so what does that mean
he purposely released his Fire Style attack into the sky causing a sudden warmth in the atmosphere and he created an ascending air current
Ascending air current
to form cumulonimbus
in other words thunder clouds
so what does that mean
instead of using his own chakra he intends to take advantage of the massive energy in the atmosphere to create a Lightning Style Jutsu
what kind
in any case it will be on a totally different scale than what anyone can create using change in Chakra Nature alone
i see
Sasuke purposely lured Itachi outside so he could also use the heat created by Amaterasu
this jutsu brings down thunder from the heavens
i merely direct its power toward you
Just as i thought
which is why it cannot be evaded
Why not
a bolt of lightning is 1 1000th of a second
it is faster than sound
the name of this jutsu is Kirin
what is that
Sasuke has tamed lightning
Come
Vanish with the roar of thunder
such power
Did Itachi die
it is over
it is over
is this the death you wanted to recreate
Damn you
that is
without this i would have been dead
what is that
you really have gotten stronger
Sasuke
this time
i shall show you my final trump card
the Susano'o
i shall show you my final trump card
the Susano'o
Susano'o
Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu
when these two powers awakened one more jutsu took root in my eyes
Sasuke is that it for your jutsu
if you are hiding another power do not hold back
the real battle is only beginning
the sky is clearing
it seems that last jutsu is limited to one shot
what is that
what is the matter
have you used up your chakra and run out of options
what
i can give it to you
i can lend you power
Damn it
you need me do not you Sasuke
i thought you were going to get revenge on Itachi
now release my power
then your wish
Judging by the feel of it
this is Orochimaru's Eight Headed Serpent Jutsu
what is that
it is because Sasuke tried to squeeze out more power despite having no chakra
Orochimaru's chakra that he'd absorbed and suppressed has shoved its way to the surface
Finally it comes out
is that
a gross fellow as always puking out stuff from his mouth
Persistent vermin like his namesake
this is it
this is what i have been waiting for
Thanks to you Sasuke's repressing chakra is gone
Now's my chance to take over the child's body
and
you think i can be beaten with that level of attack
now then Sasuke
what will you do next
this sword
it can not be
the Totsuka Blade
Itachi
you had it hidden in your possession
what is that sword anyway
the Totsuka Blade also known as the Sakegari Blade is a sword of sealing
it is said to trap and seal away those it pierces in a genjutsu world of drunken stupor for all eternity
the blade itself is imbued with a Sealing Jutsu and is a variant of the Snake Sword
Orochimaru has long searched for it
Itachi's power really is immense
this is it Sasuke
what is with Itachi's jutsu
that Susano'o jutsu it seems to be awfully risky
but
Sasuke's even lost his Sharingan and he is been stripped of Orochimaru
do not you think Itachi's won this one already
now your eyes are mine
i think i will take my time to retrieve them
Wha
what is this
something seems wrong
Damn it
that jutsu he called Susano'o
Its shield is repelling every attack
there is no mistake about it
that is also a spirit weapon
it is called the Yata Mirror and is said to deflect all things
Combined with the Totsuka Blade for attacks he is invincible
they are my eyes
mine
Itachi went down
no way
Itachi is
Itachi is dead
it is Sasuke's victory
something doesn't feel right
about what
Itachi's strength was greater than this
his moves weren't normal
Even you said something was weird
that is true
he was not able to counter attacks that he should have countered
he coughed up blood several times during the fight
Maybe Itachi had sustained serious damage even before the battle
was it caused by excessive use of his Sharingan
no
there is no way we can tell
Damn it
what is this guy
all he is doing is trying to stall us
Why can not i hit him with my Rasengan
no
that is not it
i did hit him yet
Damn it
we can not waste anymore time
i have to get past here
i have to get to Sasuke
next time on Naruto Shippuden
the Mystery of Tobi
Make sure to tune in next time
Tune in againSpace Ghost

can not
there is not any power
we are caught aII right but good
JAN
i wonder where we are
Search me
I'II take a Iook
Out slaves
as far as i can figure Blip Jan and Jace disappeared in Area 2
which is the same area a ship fuII of colonists disappeared in yesterday
Come on Blip
We'd better do some investigating
i wonder what these Iizard creeps are going to do with us
Look
over there
there is your answer
JAN
what is happening Jace
what is in those cages
JACE
People
These Iizard creeps are space slavers
JAN
Space slavers
i have heard of them
they hijack ships and seII the passengers into slavery
Space Ghost's been trying to break that up for a Iong time
yeah
WeIl in this case the sooner the better
SPACE GHOST
okay Blip this is where the twins disappeared
We'd better go on inviso power just in case
now Iet's see if we can find who is got the twins
i was right
Take a Iook below us Blip
that is a weird Iooking ship
Let's taiI them
one of the cargo ships is coming in to pick up more slaves
Bring them in through entrance 0 3
SPACE GHOST
this must be their secret base
We'd better move in fast before the doors close
so this is where that slave ring operates
if they have got Jan and Jace Iet's hope they haven't been shipped out yet
we are in Iuck
there they are
Come on Blip
BLlP GlBBERlNG
Psst
Jan
Jace
Space Ghost
Shh

i am unlocking your door

Hey he jammed their helmets over their eyes
Hold it
i have got a cleanup job for you

Creeps Iike you should be in a cage
i do not want you to feeI Ieft out
JACE
we got them covered Space Ghost
SPACE GHOST
Good
Hold them while i release their prisoners
that is one shipload of prisoners that'II be glad to get back home
and that should about wrap up the slavery ring
what about the Iizard creeps
they are safe enough
those cages ought to hold them untiI the galactic patroI picks them up
Hey where is Blip
BLlP GlBBERlNG
JACE AND JAN LAUGHlNG
SPACE GHOST
we missed one
JACE
but it Iooks Iike Blip did not

AII he said was Telus and then he went out Iike a Iight again
Telus
Hmm

It'II be hours before he can talk
i think we'd better have a Iook at this Telus planet
you three stay aboard i am going to Iook around
Right Space Ghost
i have got a feeling we are being watched
GlBBERlNG
Jan's right
there is something weird about this place
Hey
the more i struggle the more i get stuck
now if i can hit the heat ray

Better put him in cold storage with the freeze force
now to get out of here before more of them show up
GROWLlNG
GRUNTlNG

METALLUS

Space Ghost a caII on the danger alert channel
Space Ghost
it is MetaIlus the metaI monster
SPACE GHOST
what do you want
first coordinate your scanner on range 904
I'II play along
Go ahead Jan
do as he says
you will find that range 904 coincides with dead planet Beta
now watch
JACE
what are those
METALLUS
my controlled destroyers and that is dead planet Beta a perfect subject for my demonstration
Watch
Correction that was dead planet Beta
it no longer exists
Make your point MetaIlus
what is on your twisted tin mind
Look Space Ghost this is my super missile
Unless my price is met it will blast off directly at Earth itself within the hour
and your price
you will surrender to me immediately
Space Ghost you would not Iet that armor plated polecat teII you what to do
i have no choice
Release of that missile would be the Earth's doom
a wise decision Space Ghost
you will start at once unarmed and without your power bands
my directional beam will bring you to me
i never thought Space Ghost would surrender to MetaIlus
we have got to help him
but how
no one has ever Iocated MetaIlus' secret headquarters
JACE
Look
it is Blip
he must have stowed away on the Phantom Cruiser
Space Gho Hold it
Activate receiver four
JAN
that is the homing device channel
Right
Remember the homing device i attached to Blip's coIlar
so we could always find him
Hey
this could Iead us to MetaIlus' hidden headquarters
JAN
i hope we can get Space Ghost's power bands to him
JACE
so he can blast MetaIlus' power mad plans of conquest galaxy high
ROBOT
DirectionaI beam now making contact with Space Ghost's ship master
METALLUS
Good good
Bring him in
ROBOT
yes master
JAN
i have Iost Space Ghost on the scanner
how about the homing signal
StiII clear and true
METALLUS
since you refuse to work with me Space Ghost you must die
ROBOT
Master master object approaching secret position a X 8
METALLUS
Quickly
Amplify the interior audio scope
ROBOT

METALLUS
Death ray robots destroy him
I'II hit my force field
Nice shooting feIlas ha ha ha but you tickle
now try some of my energy bolts
METALLUS
Ready for me Space Ghost
Right MetaIlus
it is time to settle this business of ruling the galaxy man to man
METALLUS
Exactly
can you handle my mini meteors
the question is can you
a secret panel
METALLUS O VER SPEAKER
you will never defeat Metallus Space Ghost
Even now my super missile is on its way to destroy Earth
Jan Jace Blip
Get back to the Phantom Cruiser
i am on my way
there it is
I'II hold it back with my magnetic ray
no effect
Maybe i can deflect it with my force ray
no Iuck
and there is no time Ieft we are approaching Earth
if my heat force doesn't stop the missile Earth is finished
that was close
a few more seconds and it would have been the end of Earth
i know
Let's hope we can always defeat these power mad tyrants
what was that
MetaIlus' headquarters
i activated his destruct mechanism before i Ieft

Jo
Come in
Morning
Morning
Happy birthday
Wishing you health and success
and
a family soon
Thanks dad
do you know honey
on the day that a woman turns 30
she is extra pretty
Really
yes
but there are baggies under my eyes
Your dad proposed on your mom's 30th birthday too
Really
Dad
Let's see
you look great
how pretty
you made it through another year any birthday wishes
nothing significant
Mom
how did dad propose
Did Albert propose
no
i was just curious about how dad proposed
Your dad
Did it the old fashioned way with a ring
he had to work overtime as a tailor
he had to work his fingers till they are full of blisters
in order to buy the ring
Dad's a bit of a romantic
the ring should not be looked upon lightly
there is a hefty price that comes with it
i do not want you to suffer Jo
it is been a while sir
it has
i remember you you came to look at the rings with your girlfriend a few months ago
are they still here
would you like to take a look at them
i will think about it
Let me take it out for you
Suits you well
something else also caught my eyes
Really
we have always been of one mind
the rings in the heart shaped box
Bingo you are smart
i wonder how much it costs
is that even a concern
i am not sure if it is too measly for you
Better be expensive then
you are nuts
Sir
this ring doesn't really suit the lady here
the style's outdated and the diamond's impure
one should not buy rings like you do clothes
but necklace does suit her well
how stylish just look at it like a bowl
Please come in to look at some other rings if you will
Let me show you some of our newest styles
Outdated
Exactly i have never heard that rings are not supposed to be casually worn
some ancient Chinese sage said it think it is Mencius
more like your mom
how about this set here
Happy birthday
for you
Thank you
you look wonderful today
i am thirty after all
what is wrong
i do not know just leave me alone
if you do not take your medications Lok
you won't be able to see your classmates
C'mon be good his name's Lok
Like you he is got leukemia
Still haven't found a bone marrow match for him
he would not take any pills threw them all out
and now his legs are starting to regress
what a lovely kid yet bearing so much pain
be good Lok
Tell me where are your medications
i threw them out
Look we will go look for them in the room
Hey big guy
Hey kiddo you are a bigger monster than i am what is your name

Sounds like fun
Let's see
it is called phantom rider out to get the bad guys
but i can never beat this game
Hold your temper kid
i promise to beat it for you
i will hold you to it
you bet
Let me make you a rainbow box
Done
now you can put all your grieves and heartache in here
and hand it over to God let him handle them
a magic box huh
those in power are not doing so well nowadays
Why not make a few dozen for them to put their grieves into
and let god handle them
what want to talk back
Your honey here is been beaten by me before
Rainbow box
Bull
Patients these days are so difficult
i am such a wuss always let them grouch

you have to think through it thoroughly
and i have done just that
i Albert Lau

and your forever pleasant smiles
i have had leukemia

hello
my desolate soul finally stopped weeping
Hoping for the exuberant rainbow after the rain
Softly whispers our covenant my anxious steps
i give you my daughter
Take good care of her
i will
Love is patient love is kind
it does not envy it does not boast
it is not proud it is not rude
it is not self seeking
it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrong
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth
it always protects always trusts
Always hopes always perseveres
Love never fails
i Albert Lau
by God's ordinance
Take thee Sammi Cheng
Joanna Tse to be my wedded wife
i Joanna Tse
by God's ordinance
Take thee Albert Lau to be my wedded husband
for better or for worse
for richer for poorer
in sickness and in health
to love and to cherish
Till death do us apart
and there to i pledge thee
my faith
my anxious steps was finally able to stop walking
Lord you have prepared the table of my life
my covenant with you oh eternal covenant
Rainbow as proof everlasting
i will sing praises to celebrate the joys of life
all that is created will praise thy mercy
and the earth shall tell of thy grace
my beloved family and friends
all you single out there get ready
Go sisters
one two three
all that is created will praise thy mercy
and the earth shall tell of thy grace
all that is created will praise thy mercy
and the earth shall tell of thy grace
what games are we playing
the shoes game
everything here is paired up
would they get bored if there is only one pair of shoes
when do you think they will have kiddy shoes
one pair for you one pair for me
we can go everywhere what else can you complain about
i know
there are still lots that we haven't seen or done yet
Let's go
C'mon
so many gifts
i wonder if we can have them all in place before you leave for your studies in Australia
how did we ever go through so many books
you can not be a doctor without the hard work nor the exams
do not you know that saying
all the world is despicable except for scholars
the lack of knowledge is most apparent when it is called for
how many books do we have to go through until we can heal all the sicknesses in the world
the only thing i know is that you will be a better doctor
now i remember
it is because i had to finish this set of books that summer
that i had to give up art lessons
i wanted to be a painter when i was little
Really
Right here
because i had to read this book that year
i even missed dad's 50th birthday party
Strange huh
the books are still here
Dad's way passed 50 already
this one here
Luckily i did not finish it
Luckily
how come
it is because i haven't finished this book that day
that i came to you with the umbrella
Mount Ararat
there is a place i wanted to go when i was little
where
Mount Ararat in Turkey it is the birthplace of the first rainbow
we should go together some time
the rainbow there must be glorious
C'mon you can do it
this is extreme training
C'mon quick
i am not waiting for you
my legs are going to fall off wait up
you still have to run c'mon
Wait for me
Harder
Wait
C'mon
Hey you duped me into peddling uphill
Quick here c'mon
and you get to peddle downhill
C'mon you can do it
how else would i get down
Come quick
Fried chicken niblets taste real yummy
Come quickly into my tummy

not yet wait one more second
it is not done yet putting that on so soon
Smells nice get ready
okay c'mon
as temporary as the shooting star
but i believe love is everlasting
what are you up to
i am drawing a picture of the angel
what kind of angel let me see
i am not going to let you
how come
oh c'mon
Reputable paintings should not be shown casually
i want to see
no
Let me see that reputable painting of yours
no
Get out of here
okay i am not going to look at it
who was that hanging on the agonizing cross
the most divine love shown through his pierced hands
Alas
his hands bleeding out the unconditional love
Running through to eternity
one can only hope to give it all on the altar
Mr Albert Lau letter for you
Thank you my pleasure
do not read it
so
is anything from the Australian medical school
no
how is your reputable painting
it is work in progress
Get it done quick i want to see
the shampoo is in the third drawer
Looks really bad
Who'd draw something that bad

Thanks
Come here for a second
Look into the mirror
what is up
there are growing patches of dark circles under your eyes
there are not
Your skin's pale your hair's brittle

i do not know
Stick your tongue out further out
Your tongue's thickly coated
it is like you have got white out on it
it is brighter over here come and let me take a look
is it curable doc
yes it is
Eat healthy go to bed early plus exercise
this way you will be all energized if not invincible
how can i sleep well
Feeding a family is not an easy task
Plus the economy is not exactly blooming these days
you have got the mad cow disease and chicken epidemic
Gets worse by the day
do not stress here for you
this box's called the
the all season loving box
Load it with your grievance
Take each day at a time worry about tomorrow when you get there
okay
Bye
Thanks
Bye Bye
i am been longing to ask you this
who taught you how to make that box
when i was in chemo
the old couple in the bed next to me taught me
i will show you later
Nah i am not that dumb
Hey who is dumb now
i am going to take the trash out
you are silly
Good morning
i have been feeling quite sorry that
we have to spend our honeymoon at home due to my conditions
I'd be happy just to be with you
i thought through this already i am not going anywhere
you will have to face it one way or the other
it really doesn't matter if it works or not
the point is that you Dr Tse had done all you can
with that said you should find closure
if it is God's will that you leave
then go do the things you ought to do leave no regrets
Look at you you are like a big cat
if you knew you can get the results on the net
would you have gone through the trash
you are silly
Told you you can do it
two years
we are talking about two whole years
it is only two years it will be over in no time
i will be right here waiting
okay
the box is so pretty
Thanks

yeah please have a cup of tea
Thanks
it is the kind my hubby love most
Hubby
yeah my husband
Very aromatic
oh c'mon not this again

he is fit enough for it
no way
it is still beyond salvation
it is always like that
Hong Kong's going to crack if you guys carry on like this

what is with the change
Go go go
okay
Come over here last few steps
C'mon that is right
last two steps
yeah that is it
C'mon
one last step
you made it
someone once said the rainbow is a circle
half arching on earth the other in heaven
when we have completed our mission and leave this world
we will reach the other end of the rainbow
to be with our beloved
from then on till eternity
Show you some hot chick huh
is not she that nice doctor
yeah she is my wife
you think she is pretty
not feeling cheerful today Dr Tse
how many books do you reckon we have to read
Until we can heal all the patients in the world
Healing the outside is big but healing what is inside is gigantic
Healing what is inside
and it starts with healing what is inside you
Life's like a puzzle
besides getting into action you have got to know who is doing it with you
do not ever give up
you do have full confidence in your hubby
Hey Fan
not bad here how do you know this place
Sailed pass it a few days ago
it is nice so i thought i should bring you here
you are the one who told me not to get stuck in office meetings all the time
have to come and breath the fresh air and feel the sun
Remember this fishing line
it is been in my office for two years
yeah you scratch your back with it all the time
there are so many boats out there people bustling about
you think they know what they are after
Did Joanna call
we do not call each other
we send MMS now
we are on a match to see who calls first
what
but she does appear to be really happy
do not you miss her
Definitely
you ought to be more selfish if you want to keep her at your side
Going to Australia is the dream of her life
when you truly love them
you will want the best for someone
and hope that she is happy
i do not understand
you are so dull
i do not know how your wife puts up with you
i was filing for divorce a while back
Hey all couples
it is alright now
i went to her mother's place with this bouquet that made her day
she is all cheery rosy again so it is fine now
that is good
Thank you Dr Lau
it is only a bouquet
not the bouquet i was referring to the box
Thanks
the president called me yesterday
he asked me when i can go back and help
when would you say i can go back
Ask the hump head wrasses
Well go when we have a few
that will be real soon an hour or so
Looks like we have a catch
Bring me the net
it is so heavy
Cool must be a huge one
it is always this exciting for a first catch
C'mon
i do not understand
how can this be
i was fine really fine
Tell me why
Why
Talk to me why
Why
do not worry he is fine
Thank you so much
you are welcome
Bye bye
Excuse me doctor this is
for me
Yup
Thank you Judy
Hey can not stand not calling me anymore
Why are you so mad Dr Lau
have you forgot about the mission from God
i have rehearsed these words for three whole days
and was going to give them to you when you come back
but now that you are here
i can not seem to utter a word
Why do not you take a look at yourself
i am going to punish you now
Come with me to this place Mount Ararat Mount Ararat
C'mon
Let's go

Help yourself but you won't find it because i have hid it
if we ever have kids what do you say
their names should be
the chance of having matching bone marrow
is one in a ten thousand
Even a hundred thousand
there is still a chance in one hundred thousandth you thinking about giving up
you said he will work it out
we will live everyday in joy and happiness
Let him handle tomorrow he will have plans for it
you are right
he will keep an eye on it
what is wrong
it is too close i can not see properly
you are so beautiful
Like an angel
i know

and if it is a girl we will call her Shan

Hey Fan
hi Sit down please
Heavy snow last night

Good news is that among the bone marrow donors
there are three that match with our young patients
and the good news is that one of them is Lok
Very good
what is even better
there is none for you in Hong Kong
but i have received an email yesterday from Taiwan
Saying that there is a donor whose bone marrow matches yours completely
you have got a prefect match
yeah
yeah
a bottle of mineral water is called for to celebrate this
Thank you Fan
by the way you are a doctor yourself
his is a relapse so if we operate on him again
i am a doctor too
i have had relapses i know
i do not mean that what i mean is
those canned slow cooked soup is really good

Hey have some
if God is piecing the puzzle together for me
Guess what this picture will be
i think it is got to be
Awesome and meaningful
i can see it
See what
on the picture i see
a storm raging about
but after it has calmed down a huge bend of rainbow appeared in the sky
the trees blossomed with flowers and
a beautiful devoted
Unfailing unchanging guardian angel
do not ever give up
Give me your hand
Whether or not the operation will succeed
we have already won this battle
Happy birthday
it is the first time i ever make a cake
Looks quite good from a distance
Make a wish

Taste kind of weird
but i like this taste

Did you know
that you are really good
you really are great
you can even manage a patient such as me
i think you
are the greatest doctor in the world
the best
i am not sure why
i think he is got plans for you
there has to be a purpose
okay
but you will have to persevere
i will be at the rainbows' end in heaven
Cheering for you
my desolate soul
Finally stopped weeping
Hoping for the exuberant rainbow after the rain
Whisper the covenant between us
i Joanna Tse
in God's ordinance
Take thee Albert Lau to be my wedded husband

Lord you have prepared the table of my life
my covenant with you oh eternal covenant
Rainbow as proof everlasting
i will sing praises to celebrate the joys of life
all that is created will praise thy mercy

Timofei
lvan Badmaevich
Pardon me

my uncle
my father's brother
how do you like the cigars
H i
H i
Come on in
Please meet U ncle Vanya
who is that
H is uncle
what is he doing here
Came to visit his nephew
the uncle is going to live here too
no do not go away
i do not know what to do with them
when i was a man
i could not allow myself to dress like that
you know U lumji
i suffered so much consulted countless doctors
and they all tried to dissuade me
but i regret nothing
i really recommend you do it
of course it is not cheap
but it is worth it
you will find the money for the operation i hope
he needs the support from all of us at this time
when i look at these smooth arms of mine without a single hair
i bless the Lord
yes i bought this gorgeous nail polish
Try it
and never regret the loss of that small unpleasant detail
the operation is always done under full sedation
hello you are on
Talk to us
i can not hear you
Talk to us
may i speak
Go ahead finally i have reached you
l'm Vasya from the Moscow Region
Yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday
i want you to play a song for her and i want to say
Masha i love you so much
do not be angry i just could not reach you on the phone
it just so happens by chance it seems
l've figured out what eternity means
can you film my deer in a commercial
that is a great idea
this is a present for your deer
l've put on your gown okay
do i have an option
Good morning
H i
lt's delicious
Buddhism teaches us the pleasure of simple things
Like salted tea with butter
U lumji's grandma taught him to cast away evil spirits by stirring tea exactly 22 times
little U lumji spent every summer with his grandma
he and his friend would herd sheep
Once they made a fire by a lake and suddenly wanted never to be apart
Perhaps we have all lived through this kind of summer when walking on earth felt like flying
U lumji never forgot that summer
what is going on
lt's my parents l'm not here
lf you do not open up l'il turn you all in to the cops
i can see you guys
what do we do now
do not open the door
U lumji we have come for you
l've the right to live however and with whomever i want
l'm going to call the police
l'il call the fire brigade and the rescue squad
lt's better to open
Why l'm an adult
Gotta brothel happening here
you better talk with them
no do not do it
they are your family
i will talk to them myself
l'm gonna get you later
she has nothing to do with it
she is that anchorwoman
no
that is a man
Call me
Good bye
Enough enough
U lumji we came after you
do not talk to your father like that
Come on
H urry
and this is for me
you should get an iron door sometime soon
i liked his mother
and his uncle
not much
at what age did you start your sexual life
do not remember
Your first sexual partner
do not remember
he is absolutely normal
you never get anything good for free
Maybe they are telling the truth
Should've greased her palm
i n the old days there were real healers
not anymore
you are wrong
i know a doctor
i took my boss to him once
where did you bring me
do you know who comes here
who
a certain you know who
Wait
where you going
Your uncle really decided that you wanted to become a woman
do you know what the famous Greek philosophers thought about it
and your friends do not know what they want
they should read this book as well
Help me
what would you like to change about yourself
what would you advise
Enlarged bust hair styled intimate area eliminates life problems
M imic corrections
and what is that
we give you a shot your facial muscles become atrophied
you won't be able to smile wrinkles smooth away
what else do you have
i can recommend bio stimulation of the abdomen and hip muscles
Very well
how is that
you like it
lt's okay
Getting used to it
yes
now i will be increasing the voltage
our ratings are falling
something should be changed
the hair color should be changed
and something must be done about the breasts
Enlarge them
Emphasize them
Reveal them
not sure
more purple colors
our viewers are housewives we need to be neutral
Maybe we simply need an anchorman
Maybe we should show more sex
Maybe we should dress her in Cacharel
something like that
you will get used to it
H i darling
what are your plans
None l'm at work
will be here till late
l'm also at work
do not wait for me
Go to bed
okay l've a lot of work too
Bye
Why are you spying on me
i guess i should do something perhaps
or l'il lose my grip on this ground
Afraid to vanish under my anchorwoman image
i learn from you how to betray all for sake of self
that is more important in this world which every moment robs us of ourselves
l'm at a loss here
ls this your friends' house
no i do not know who owns it
lt's supposed to be fun
i wish to fall in love
Girls come on
with no dirty stuff
whose house is this
my boyfriend's
he is 45 and l'm like a son to him
oh the senators have arrived
i n what sense
i n the straight sense

for quite a while
and he suits you as a guy
Well yes

i talked to the doctor
lt's worse than we thought
he is got a taste for guys
how is that
now you may forget about grandkiddies
a guy won't bear children from a guy
we have wasted all that money
we should take this business into our hands
Teach the rascal a lesson
Shaming our family our people shaming his own uncle
lf my boss finds out l'il get fired and l'il never get into real politics
i could have been a personal driver for you know who
what is wrong with you
do not feel good
for his successful campaign Airfreedom gave Timofei a video camera and 2 tickets to any place on the globe
i feel as if everyone around knows about us
you said you did not care
Trying to get used to it
Timofei offered to buy a third ticket for me but i chose to concentrate on my work
i must go l'm doing the night time edition
but maybe
Wait
by taking U lumji's amulet
i was not only taking the joy of his past but also a part of his future
hello
something happened
Your father has died

M ine too l'm coming with you

Excuse me
hello
Timofei did not remember how he got back home
he lay almost delirious when John called
he said he understands Timofei and that i should tell him that love which we'il discover on Earth is only an advertisement of the one in heaven
l'il tell him
Goodbye
you know Pushkin once wrote i loved you so and still i want to say my love for you still hasn't died away but let it not mar your unblemished soul l'il suffer not this sadness to befall'
Thanks
what is wrong with you
i see how happy you are and my heart is breaking about my nephew
i dreamt that he would become a real man like you and maybe a senator
but he what a shame is a fag
a fag you say
Great
We'il make him a senator
Let's drink to that
Soon after Timofei received a letter from U lumji
U lumji wrote that he is free and happy
i n the army just like in life you must see the good in the bad
at the end of the letter it said in capital letters
YO U i LO VE
2 YEARS LAT E R

Mm hmm
Prove it
Ooh
Impressive

Holy shit
what
what
Prior to Atlanta General
i worked here at Palm Glade for nine years
Well um back when it was Palm Glade before it was Well Core which you obviously already know
Mostly in the E R but also in pediatrics and case management critical care
Just got engaged
so you will be taking time off for your honeymoon
oh i suppose i will
we haven't even set a date for the wedding yet
that is not gonna be a problem is it
i think i have got everything i need
we will be in touch
we will be in touch
Well that doesn't sound so bad
are you kidding me
i mentioned i was engaged and he looked at me like i was toxic
Maybe we should not have said anything
Said anything
you know until we were sure
oh i am sorry
Until we were sure
no sure about the date not sure about being sure
because you are sure
oh i am totally sure
there ain't no backing out now mister
Good
otherwise this would've been really awkward
Surprise
Whoo
you are so sweet
what
Thank you
you are dead
Come here you
Congratulations
Thank you
you know you are too good for him right
oh believe me
Right here
which i second and third
Thank you you guys
i i am sorry
what about me
um what about you
we got you a cake
all you care about is stuffing your face anyway
that is true
Guys i really hate to do this
then do not
but we sort of have a body
okay
and i guess that means we sort of have to go
i am so sorry
uh i will see you later on tonight
yeah
okay
oh are not you forgetting something
oh
that is right
the piece of cake to go
yes
Love you
Love you
Mm thank you
first on the scene said the body was found by a couple of frat boys about 1 00 a M
no wallet no i D
no pants to put them in
Detectives said they'd just been thrown out of a launch party for a new rum drink at the Captain's Bridge
New rum drink
Cabrillo Velvet Cherry
they will leave their interviews on your desk
i am gonna go with that glass sticking out of her head
as cause of death
Won't know for sure until i examine her but I'd say she died of blunt force trauma
Looks like she was struck with a heavy glass bottle
Heavy glass bottle of Velvet Cherry Rum
Must've spilled all over the victim when the glass broke
and also why the sand stuck to her
Looks like the killer realized that and covered her up the rest of the way to hide the body whoever she is
Well if i was to have a guess as to who she is
I'd say she is that girl
the Glades 04x02 Shot Girls Original Air Date June 3 2013 sync correction by dcdah for www addic7ed com
the pizza pit
Really
you did tell him it is a celebration and we can go somewhere that doesn't have sawdust on the floor
i am just glad he will be there at all
he is been so damn moody since i got home
i want to throttle him
Everything's all right though right
i mean he is okay with us getting married
i guess
i mean he hasn't really said much
i am gonna fly him up to Atlanta with me have him help me pack up the apartment
it will give us a chance to talk
Well let me know if there is anything i can do
i will
okay
Love you
i love you
Bye
Bye
what
can you tell me about Miss Velvet Cherry here
Based on rigor and liver temp confirmation time of death between 10 00 P M and midnight
Prime time party time
that is probably why no one heard or said anything
Also confirmed cause of death as blunt force trauma to the head
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
which i trust you have dusted
Unfortunately it was just a mash up of indiscernible prints
but i did find something that was interesting
the victim wore a ring on her right hand
that is actually not that interesting
which she wore turned around so that the large stone and the intricate setting was facing palm side in
i used to wait tables over at Robbie's raw bar
you turn your ring like that so you do not snag it on anything when you are serving
Except she did snag it on something or someone
i found skin tissue on the ring
she fought with someone
so the killer is now sporting a pretty nasty scratch
i sent it to the lab to see if we can get some epithelial DNA
Good
Really
is that necessary
uh no
it is uh evidence
from from the crime scene
i thought it might be a good reminder of who we are working for
Puts a face to the victim
Just not a name
Actually it does
i contacted the Cabrillo Rum Distillery that hired the shot girls sent them a tumbler
the owner Jojo Cabrillo confirmed the victim's identity as Meghan Daniels
yes Meghan was beautiful
but there was so much more to her than just her looks and great body
so Meghan was not just the face of your latest rum concoction
Being a shot girl was just a means to an end for Meghan
there was not anything she could not do if she set her mind to it
it is why i cosigned a bank loan for her so she could go to grad school
oh
that was nice of you
not to mention sad
so much lost potential
no i mean sad that now you are on the hook for a loan that she will never use
you find her murder funny detective
no
um just makes me wonder
Wonder
what you are hiding by wearing sunglasses inside
huh
and given that my victim had DNA on the ring she was wearing the night she was attacked
I'd be hiding that too if i were you
and drinking heavily
i am drinking because i am sad
and the scratch i got at work
one of the hazards of working with shot girls and drunk men
some jackass got handsy with one of my girls so she triggered her security band and i had to step in
i am sorry
a security band
Sort of like a panic button
each of the girls wears one
was Meghan wearing one
of course
they all were
Why
Well we did not find it on her body
can i see the master control
huh
Mind if i take this
who is this
another one of your shot girls
Ashley Collins
we did a shoot with her when we were considering her for the face of Velvet Cherry
but you went with Meghan instead
so apart from getting a life sized cutout of yourself which frankly should be more than enough what else comes from being the face of Cabrillo Velvet Cherry Rum
Personal appearance fees modeling work royalties
it adds up
Adds up as in Ashley being pissed off she was passed over for Meghan
she knew it was nothing personal
a focus group just decided that Meghan would be a better fit for the Velvet Cherry brand
besides what could Ashley do about it
you mean other than kill the competition
Honestly there was not anything unusual about last night
i mean those events can get a little crazy
we are all pretty busy doing our own thing
Pushing Velvet Cherry selling shots
we are only really together when we are in the limo
Limo
we ride together so we can make a big entrance
so the limo's the last time you saw Meghan
Actually now that i think about it she was not in the limo
she came by herself a little bit later
that makes sense
Big star wants to make her own entrance
she was hardly the big star
Well all those life sized cutouts of her everywhere kind of say she was
and she was the face of Velvet Cherry Rum
you know which comes with all those appearance fees and uh modeling gigs and
it could've been any one of us
but it was not
it was Meghan
Nice rocking chair
uh family heirloom
it is my dad's
he had a stroke last year and he lives with me now
Sorry to hear it
although the money you would've made as the face of Velvet Cherry would've come in handy
my dad has a nice enough pension
we get by just fine
oh and for the record
i saw your proofs from your modeling shoot
you know in my opinion you were robbed
but i guess the focus group thought differently
what focus group
it was Pruitt Wolcott
he chose Meghan
who is Pruitt Wolcott
he is the distributor for Cabrillo Rum
he is married to Jojo Cabrillo
Jojo my other suspect
Well that is cozy or convenient
any guesses as to why he chose Meghan over you
i do not know
You'd have to ask him
Maybe because she was willing to do things i was not
next
that would be me actually
so your wife's a producer
Cabrillo Rum
Mm hmm
and you buy from her
Doesn't make it a conflict of interest
i own the biggest distribution company in the southeast detective
i buy from a lot of producers not just my wife
besides we keep the two businesses completely separate
Completely separate
you hand pick her shot girls
Jojo trusts my instincts
i know the customers and what they want
the customers want to sleep with a shot girl
like Meghan Daniels who you hand picked
i was not sleeping with Meghan detective
Really
i love my wife and i will never cheat on her
besides once i pick the shot girl that is it for me
i never see them again
so you weren't at the bar last night
you did not see Meghan
i was at the bar but only long enough to make sure they had enough rum
then i went home alone
so you had no contact with Meghan whatsoever
None whatsoever
so we good
if you say so
Great
i got to get to another meeting
so either your table's ready or that is Meghan's panic button
Ha
and you are lying to me
i did not take Meghan's panic button detective
and i certainly did not kill her
now i found it on the floor at the bar put it in my pocket
i just forgot i had it
Well that makes perfect sense
Why did not you tell me that back at the office instead of making me drag your ass all the way down here
oh wait
that is right
you are a liar and i do not believe you
Why would i kill her
i do not know
Usual reasons a rich older married man kills a smoking hot 22 year old because either she threatened to break it off with you or tell your wife
Except i was not sleeping with her
Why
because some cutout runner up said i was
do you know how many girls auditioned to be the face of Velvet Cherry
362
and do you know how many were convinced they lost because i was sleeping with Meghan
361
Well i could not please them all right
Bet that did not stop you from trying
Right
and i am guessing one of those 361 girls had the good sense not to want to see you naked
yeah
okay
Ashley Collins
and if this is coming from her
let me tell you something detective
she was insanely jealous of Meghan
okay
i can see why a good looking girl like Ashley might feel rejected as in you rejecting her for the face of Velvet Cherry
she definitely did not take it well
you know and that was the problem with Ashley
Shot girls need to be the life of the party not all righteous and sanctimonious
what is a smoking hot 22 year old beach bunny got to be righteous and sanctimonious about
she had like big time daddy issues
' cause her father was sick and she had to look after him
that is hardly a motive for murder but i can see how that might not make her shot girl material
Right
she just barely got along with the other girls especially Meghan
their fights and arguments were epic
Fights and arguments about what
no idea
i just assumed it was the same jealousy and back stabbing that'd been going on between those two for months
huh
Detective i pulled Ashley's financials like you asked
at first i could not find anything unusual
a lot of cash deposits to her ATM mostly weekends several hundred dollars at a time
Tip money
nothing unusual about that
Right
but then i cross checked Ashley's bank statements with Meghan's and this is where things get interesting
for the past six months
Ashley had been withdrawing 300 a day from her ATM the last week of the month Monday through Friday
that is 1 500 cash
and for the past six months and the last Friday of the month
Meghan was depositing 1 500 cash into her bank account
now that is either a weird coincidence
or Ashley was making secret payments to Meghan but did not want a record of it
Really
all three of you have nothing better to do than to stare at our half naked victim
Well i do not know about these two but i am investigating
as in you see what i am seeing
a stain of some type
Spatter maybe
it is not dark enough to be blood though
but it was at our crime scene so
so i will run a few tests to see if there is any DNA on it
and now that we know that Ashley was making payments to Meghan maybe we should look into Meghan's financials
i was not trying to hide the money detective
Meghan offered me a loan and that is how she wanted it paid back in cash
and is this really the best time
Well i am pretty sure some of my questions are gonna piss you off and you are naked so at least i know you won't be running off anywhere
what was the loan for
when my dad came to live with me
i had to buy one of those medical beds and fix up the bathroom with special bars and grips
it was not cheap
my dad's state pension and insurance was not enough to cover it so Meghan loaned me some money
Well that was nice of her
but maybe you should've just cut back on the hot rocks and Bjorn's magic fingers here
you know what
this is like the one thing i do for myself okay
if you have ever taken care of a sick parent you'd know what i mean
it is totally draining
my dad has his physical therapy today and i have been really stressed lately
oh yeah no
i have heard murder can be hell on the nerves
i also heard that you and Meghan pretty much hated each other
You'd been fighting for months
was it over that money she loaned you
Hey girls fight okay
it doesn't mean anything
Meghan and i are both competitive people
you have to be in our business
what
no it is just
Well it is kind of funny
someone referring to grinding up against drunken frat boys to get them to buy shots of cheap booze a business
Well good news is Meghan's dead so now you no longer have to pay off that debt
Look i told you what the money was for so are we done
I'd like to get back to my massage
Mm hmm
for now
oh but if i find out you are lying about that loan you know like it was not for medical supplies and has something to do with why you killed Meghan
i will be back
now you really got your work cut out for you
i tracked down the cab company that brought Meghan to the Captain's Bridge last night
like you asked
the taxi picked her up at the Wyndermere Grand Resorts but she doesn't have any credit card charges at the hotel's restaurant or bar
and she was not registered there as a guest but guess who was
Jojo's husband Pruitt
Exactly and not the first time either
Apparently it was a weekly thing
Sounds like an affair to me
Just got surveillance video from the bar that night
i am gonna run through it now
yeah
Let me know
Thanks
Jeff it is fine but a little notice would've been nice
Right
i heard you the first time
Just do not be too late
we have a 7 00 a M flight tomorrow
Love you too
Bye
uh change in our celebration dinner
i guess tonight is the only night his study group could get together and finish their project
oh
yeah
Well maybe it is
or maybe he is not that happy about us getting married and therefore nothing to celebrate
i do not know
i wish he would talk to me instead of avoid me
Well he is 15 and you are his mom
uh at least you will have a captive audience in Atlanta
in the meantime you know what this means do not you
it means that since we have the house to ourselves we can do anything we want for dinner
anything
anything
Bamboo Palace and a Duck Dynasty marathon
oh you read my mind
what are we waiting for
where were you
i called you like an hour ago
Having moo shu pork with Jase and Willie Robertson
what do you got
Lab results on the tissue we found on Meghan's ring
the DNA was a composite match with the swab taken from Jojo's shot glass and that is not all
Daniel
oh right
um surveillance footage from the bar shows Jojo and Meghan having an argument of some kind a little before 11 00 an argument they take out the side door
10 minutes later Jojo returns alone with a pretty nasty scratch on her left cheek
that will work
i also found Meghan's phone
it was with her purse and clothes in the back of the Humvee stretch
Limo driver says she gave it to him for safe keeping when she arrived by cab
i haven't figured out the pass code to it yet
no worries Daniel
i got all i need for the moment
Hey
Detective
we are having a launch tonight so i hope whatever it is it can wait until morning
Well it could but i figure why run the risk of you fleeing the country when i can just take you in for Meghan's murder right now
Except i did not kill Meghan Daniels
Really
' Cause we have your DNA on the ring she was wearing the night she was attacked and we have video footage of you and Meghan fighting right before she was murdered
and since we know that your husband was having weekly auditions with Meghan at the Wyndermere well now we have motive
and before you get too mad at your husband for making you kill Meghan Daniels just think of all the women that wanted to be the face of Velvet Cherry that he was not sleeping with
it was not a fight fight
we just disagreed over the way she was representing our product to some of the customers
Representing your product
is that code for just rubbing your logo in people's faces or just your husband's which after months of humiliation you'd finally decided you'd had enough
if i had known about the affair
i would've confronted Pruitt not killed Meghan
and i certainly would not have cosigned a loan for her to go to grad school
oh come on Jojo
Even Ashley knew about the affair
you expect me to believe that you are the only person that did not know how Meghan really became the face of your rum
okay well while you are thinking up your next lie
i have to check on something
Daniel found video on Meghan's phone
you are gonna want to see
Ooh
and that uh loan she was talking about
oh let me guess
it is not real
oh no
it was real all right
to the tune of 60 000
most of which is still in Meghan's personal account
i have looked and i can not find any records of Meghan either applying to or paying tuition to any graduate school
Only a payment for 16 000 to a Vaghn Enterprise whatever that is
i am still trying to track that down
what
oh yes
uh Vaghn Enterprises absolutely
uh Daniel send this to my phone
i already did
okay
Well if you are not willing to discuss the affair maybe you will tell me about Vaghn Enterprises
Vaghn Enterprises
i have no idea what that is
Well for one thing it is where 16 000 of that 60 000 bank loan you cosigned for Meghan went which means either Meghan was conning you or you were paying her money for some reason
i am telling you i do not know what you are talking about
oh really this time or really like when you said that you had no idea about your husband's affair but really you have known all along
Either way we have got enough to book you which i am sure your shareholders won't be happy about
so
okay fine
i knew about my husband's affair
how could i not with Ashley practically rubbing it in my face
but that loan was months ago and i swear she told me it was for school
and if i was gonna kill someone it would not have been Meghan
it would've been my husband
Why did not you
because i love Pruitt and he loves me
and even great marriages fall victim to temptation
i was not gonna throw my marriage away over some cheap fling
Only it was not that cheap was it
60 grand means nothing to me
no i meant your marriage which does mean something to you but which had fallen victim to something a lot bigger than just your garden variety temptation hadn't it
i mean it was in real trouble
Seriously i am done with that bitch
Too much yelling
she is always yelling telling me what to do
i will have another bottle sent up
you know
no more sneaking around
from now on it is just you and me
i never loved her anyway
I'd like to speak to my lawyer
that was an odd reaction
it is like she was more sad than angry
yeah
Detective i noticed
Meghan is still receiving texts and e mails on her phone from people who apparently do not know she is dead
would love to meet and discuss your offer
Prepared to leave Pruitt
however need an increase of 2 a case
can you make that work
Delivery schedule approved
Call me
i checked the numbers
those are all messages from distillers and retailers who are currently doing business with Wolcott Distribution
if i did not know better
I'd say it looks like Meghan was launching her own distribution company
which might also be why she is got information about Pruitt's contacts on her phone including a little yacht party tomorrow
Nice
Exit interviews can be very useful in terms of helping the hospital to set policy
so that in the future hopefully they can do a better job convincing valuable employees like your mom to stay
yeah yeah
she can be pretty awesome
and it is really a shame
i mean i know she really liked it here mostly because of you
oh well that is sweet of you to say
Well it is true
what is true
nothing
all right i am gonna grab a soda
Anybody else
Dr Buckley
i am good
Thanks
all right
what a little charmer
yeah
not so much around me anymore
i am sure it is just a phase
so you are all done
yep
i did my interview turned in my security badge my parking pass
i am officially a former employee of Atlanta General or anywhere
Callie it is gonna be fine
and i mean you are engaged
that part of your life is looking up
yeah it is just everything else is starting to sink in
and duty calls so i will let you go
this is not goodbye
i am still coming over later to help you pack
and see you off right
yeah
That'd be great
Hey
Pruitt man great party
what brings you here detective
not an invitation
i know that much
no
uh sorry no
um Meghan had a note in her appointments about this little client party you had here today
do not i know that guy
i doubt it
i am sure i do
i do not think you do
yep
no
here he is
Ken Krause
President and C E O of Quickie Stop Liquor
27 stores
Wife Patty
Definitely doable
uh hey Ken
Hey
hi
Hey say hi to Patty for me all right
what are you doing
what are you doing
Let's see who else is here
uh who is this guy
William Lundquist
C E O of Lundquist Beverages
35 stores
Daughter Katie
Smoking hot bod
oh we definitely got to find William
William
Just stop it
would you like to go someplace a little more private
now would not that be a great idea
can i get you a drink or can not you drink when you are on duty
oh even on duty i can drink that
Non alcoholic beer
it is an interesting choice being a liquor distributor especially at a party where you are pushing booze
i like to stay clear headed when i am working
now i do not know where you got that information but those are my private notes
i use those to help me remember details about my clients
Well their wives and daughters anyway
and notes that somehow appeared on Meghan's phone
any idea how that happened
Like maybe she stole them off your phone after she got you too drunk to notice
that is ridiculous
Ridiculous
or do you just hate to admit that the only reason she was sleeping with you was so she could learn your business and steal your clients
Meghan was not stealing my clients
Even if she tried she could not do it
Look around you
my clients love me
Just not as much as they loved Meghan which if she was stealing your clients and she was
That'd be a hell of a good reason to kill her
Like yeah Sun Coast Markets 2 5 million in gross annual liquor sales just agreed to terms giving all of their business to Meghan
and what do you say 2 5 million worth killing her for
yeah
okay
i had an affair with Meghan obviously
it doesn't mean that i killed her
no but it doesn't mean that you did not
i mean you had more than enough reason to
Apart from her being a threat to your marriage at least in your alcohol saturated mind
Meghan was stealing your clients to create a competing business
first of all my alcohol saturated behavior aside
Jojo was the love of my life and she knows it
and secondly i have lost clients before detective
i am not gonna start killing over lost business
i mean if every distributor who is ever lost a client started killing the competition there'd be no one left to buy booze from
Even clients like Sun Coast and the 2 5 million in sales
do not tell me that would not hit your bottom line
not to mention your lifestyle like that boat the catered parties all those eager shot girl hopefuls
yeah
okay it would
Definitely
but like i said it is just business
now unless you are planning on arresting me for a murder i did not commit
I'd like to get back to work
Apparently i got some clients i need to try to win back
yeah just not Sun Coast Lundquist Beverages and Quickie Stop Liquor now that your competition's dead
oh and uh be sure to keep that yacht of yours in harbor
i want to be sure i know where to find you
can i help you find something detective
yeah
that shot girl calendar that i found in Pruitt s office
oh do not worry
i got it
Nice
Really
Again
i suppose you are gonna tell me that this is also a part of your investigation
Well this is part of my investigation
i can not speak for Carlos or Daniel
me
i was not even looking
Good then you got time to look at this
These addresses on these dates here on the calendar
can you look into them see what you can find out
Why
what are you thinking
i am thinking a guy like Pruitt probably has a different girl in every city that he does business and after seeing how he rolls after a few shots
i am thinking maybe he slurred out something useful
like maybe a confession
Hmm
who me
Well uh i am just here to share what i have learned about that stain on Meghan's cutout
Presumptive tests suggest a gastric aspiration
a what
Vomit
that the technical term
Actually yeah
but hardly unexpected outside of a rowdy bar
that could've come from anybody
the sheer number boggles the mind
Except the number includes our killer
some people just do not have the stomach for murder
i am still waiting for a few tests to come back
that should give us the exact content along with DNA
any word on Vaghn Enterprises
i found an LLC filed for Vaghn Enterprises three days ago
the C E O is registered as Meghan Daniels
Paperwork just went through
that is why i could not get it right away
Apparently it is a 50 000 square foot warehouse which is what that 16 000 was used for
first and last month's rent
a risk free startup
that way if she failed and lost everything
Jojo's still stuck with paying off the loan
huh
Well Jojo was not lying about one thing
Meghan was more than just a pretty face
a pretty face that even in death
Jojo was not willing to forgive
that call to her attorney that was not just lawyering up
she is already filed a cease and desist order to have every check in Meghan's account frozen pending an investigation into fraud
Well apparently hell hath no fury like a woman ripped off
Daniel look into everyone's finances
See if it all lines up
oh and um look into those addresses for me would you
you got it
so Miranda said you were quite the charmer today
you know not that that is news to me
it is just nice to know how people feel about you
it makes me proud
you know you'd tell me if something was bothering you right Jeff
Sure
because if something's bothering you
Mom nothing's bothering me
okay right
but if there was you'd tell me right
it is not a big deal
okay
what is not a big deal
it is nothing
is it us
is it me and Jim
no
no
okay look
last year you were totally excited about coming to Atlanta
you said this was an opportunity too good to pass up
it is
it was
so how come Atlanta doesn't matter anymore
how come it is all about getting married
it is not all about getting married
Look i like Jim okay
he is a good guy
but do you even know what you want
' Cause i am a little tired of just not knowing where we are gonna be or if we are even gonna be together
of course we are going to be together
do not say of course
not with how many times you have gone back and forth
at least when dad had problems
i knew you and i would be together and that way we'd be okay
now it is like oh i am going to Atlanta
oh no i am gonna marry Jim
you are right
i am sorry
that is fair
i am sorry
i just want to know that this is what you really want
okay
that marrying Jim and leaving Atlanta is what you really want
yes
it is what i want
i want you and me and Jim to be a family
 Drop it in the middle of the dance floor   moves like Neyo matrix in slow mode   slide down the pole like an eskimo 
Ashley's the new face of Velvet Cherry
Thought your focus group did not like her
Screw my focus group
i am divorcing the bastard and doing things my way
Wow
so much for the other cheek
Even for someone willing to sic her lawyers onto a dead woman
i have worked hard to build my brand detective
and willing to do anything to protect it would be my guess
if that is an insinuation that i killed Meghan sorry to disappoint
no but it must've been killing you that not only was Meghan playing you for your money she was also playing your husband right out of his marriage
i took my marriage very seriously and i was willing to forgive a lot
Maybe too much
but there is some things i can not forgive and it is not like my husband is the only liquor distributor in Florida
Throw a rock hit a liquor distributor huh
and now at least you have Ashley
i mean she might be a little sanctimonious but anyone willing to take care of an ailing parent is at least someone you can rely on
Rely on Ashley
Please that is a joke
her big debut and she can not even turn up here on time
uh yeah
i did notice she was looking a little flat
Ashley's anything but flat or reliable
she can barely take care of herself
let alone an ailing parent
huh
Daniel need you to look into something for me
there she is
New face of Velvet Cherry but you are missing your big night
oh uh yeah
something came up at the last minute
no i can see that
yeah funny what murder can do to your schedule
i already told you detective i did not kill anyone
and yet you are getting while the getting's good
Apparently including your father's rocking chair
that is not very caregiver y of you
what is poor old dad gonna rock on now
oh wait no
that is right
Your father's dead
okay so my name's on all my fathers accounts
i told you i was his caregiver
i had to shop for him
i had to pay for his doctor's bills
i had to pay for his meds
which you did up until eight months ago when all those bills suddenly disappeared
Look
the last few months have been really hard okay
and maybe i haven't made the best choices
that is putting it mildly
but i am still processing
the only thing you are processing are your dad's pension checks worth 4 200 a month to be exact each and every month
okay whatever
it is not like i asked for them
they just kept showing up
what was i supposed to do
Send them back
uh yeah
which i am guessing you knew and so did Meghan
i did not kill her detective
which is why you used your dad's pension checks at 4 200 a month to pay Meghan 1 500 to keep her mouth shut
which she in turn used to buy booze to start a new business
i got to tell you Ashley
Meghan may have had it over you in terms of looks but in terms of smarts
oh wait
she had it over you there too
i am still waiting on DNA but i got a preliminary report back on the contents of the vomit
Sodium yeast a grain of some type
Beer
that is what i thought but there is almost no alcohol content
Non alcoholic beer
who drinks non alcoholic beer at a rum party
Only one person i know
so you believe me now right
that means i can go
Well you could but then we'd just have to pick you up for insurance fraud so no
Seen Daniel
you are right detective
those addresses from Pruitt s calendar were in cities where he does business but they weren't for girlfriends and they are not for distillers and retailers either
there is a school a few churches community center
Places that hold a a meetings
Exactly
and you were right about that prenup too
Pruitt and Jojo have a very specific one
i just sent it to your phone
got it
Thanks
Permission to come aboard
since when do you ask
oh sticking with the near beer huh
yeah i think i learned my lesson
Well better late than never
although under the circumstances never might've been a much smarter choice
yeah
Jojo made me give it up
Apparently i am not that fun to be around when i am drunk
yeah
she did a little more than ask though did not she
she put it in your prenup
she ever caught you drinking again not only would you lose her but she would get 100 of your community property including your distribution business
See this was never about Meghan stealing clients or even about the affair
you knew Jojo would forgive you for that
which she did
many times
you were afraid that she'd find out you were drinking again which Meghan knew and which is why she made that video to use against you in case you ever caught on to what she was up to which meant killing Meghan was the only way you could ensure that she'd never show that video to Jojo
but hey good news is that you were so sickened by crushing Meghan's skull that for once you did the right thing
you threw up
DNA that went all over Meghan's cutout which is how we can put you at the crime scene and which is why we know it was you
that is the good news huh
Well if you are me
Really
that is um fantastic
Thank you
i will be there Monday morning
Thank you
i got my old job back at Palm Glade
i mean Well Core Medical
which for some reason i feel like you already knew
yeah
um they sort of called me to vet you
i wanted to tell them that you are a slacker and i am pretty sure you were stealing drugs and selling them on the streets but for some reason what came out was that you were the best head nurse i have ever worked with and they'd be crazy not to hire you immediately
Thank you
you are welcome
okay that is the last of it
the trash and recyclables are by the curb and the cab's down there too so
okay
i will just be a minute
i will meet you down there
Hey hey
not so fast
all right
it was so nice to meet you Jeff
Nice meeting you too
you have a safe trip back
and take care of your mom for me okay
yeah i will
See you
See you
okay
uh this time it is goodbye
and you have got a plane to catch so
there is just something i want to say to you first
i never could've made it through this last year without you
when i was overwhelmed or confused or afraid that i was not good enough you were always there to encourage me
and when i felt lost or alone you would remind me that there were people who loved me and were rooting for me
you you have been my mentor my cheerleader and something i haven't had in a really long time which is a best friend  one life ends   another life begins 
i am really gonna miss you  when all is lost   i can find myself again 
you haven't seen the last of me
i promise  do not know this   i do not have anything figured out   i am gonna tell you once again my love   as soon as i get comfortable it is time to move on   and i can tell you   that this winding road that i am walking   is gonna lead me back to where i belong   Ooooooh   back to where i belong   believe believe believe believe me   back to where i belong  sync correction by dcdah for www addic7ed com
i see you honey
i do not know how carcass lady does it
her name's holly whitish
she is been doing it for 10 years so
all things considered you should thank her
yeah
why is that
Cleaning up roadkill used to be the deputies' job
in a few months this will all be high dollar topsoil
here
this will help mask the scent
it is hazelnut
we are fine
Speak for yourself
here
Well i am glad you guys got here quick as you did
' cause i mean i am pretty used to the poor animals but you know seeing an actual dead person it just kind of hits you different you know
yeah
we appreciate the call
Look like you have your hands full here so
yeah well it is my busiest time of year
after the Wyoming winter all these horny kids start chasing each other back and forth on the highway and i pick up the pieces
there is a wound on his chest
Gunshot
he is got
Bruises and scratches all over his face
Abrasions on his right hand
Looks like he got a couple last licks in himself
you recognize him
no
oh
it is a Smith Wesson 40
it is for mercy killings
it is registered though
there is no wallet but i found his tobacco
oh actually that is mine
oh careful
Sheriff you are stepping on big Charlie's foot right there
when did you find big Charlie
two evenings ago
and her
Slender Betsy
i just brought her home yesterday morning
it was just after dawn
Victim was sandwiched between these two so time of death's probably somewhere between uh dinnertime two days ago and 6 00 a M yesterday
you mind uh giving me the names of everybody who had access to your place the last 48 hours
oh i wish i could but i am out on the road all the time and i just leave this place open to the public
Ever since they wrote that article about me in the paper last week people just like to drive by and have a look
all my martyrs for love
Cady
you home
i can barely read Doc Bloomfield's report
Says the victim died from a gunshot wound
Doesn't say what caliber
Looks like a 38
Holly was carrying a 40 so
uh my
Mylea
M m malee
Mal maleewhose is this
we thought it was time for your first gauntlet
all right
Look it even matches my outfit
Thank you Mauser
oh where is that laser fire thingy
i do not want to touch it it may go off by accident
oh no that only has a shield projector and a heat sensitive view finder
we thought that was enough for now
Well it is like a training bra
oh maybe i can paint some little flowers on it
like red roses or maybe blue ones
what
Hel i am picking up a transmission on Channel 12 a
Incoming
can you hear me
Respond immediately i am under attack
we got it Voice
it is coming from Sector K Level 9
Nobody lives that close to the surface
Nobody's gonna be living there much longer
you hear that laser fire
i repeat
we are under attack
this is Jake Lawson
Please respond
Did he just say Jake Lawson
i have lost it
that is what i heard
who is Jake Lawson
Lawson was a great protector
Protector of what
someone the more stable levels hired to protect them
he was the best
if you heard a level was under Jake Lawson's protection you know it would be a tough raid
oh kind of like a frontier marshal thing
Tell him we are on our way
no wait a minute
we do not know if that is really him
Tell him we are on our way
this is Mauser Wave 34
Assistance is being directed towards your location
is anybody out there
he can not hear us
then we better hurry
Why are you so hot to help Jake Lawson
i saw him fight once
i was with the Black Watch
we were trying to take Level 64 off the beta shaft
you were with the Watch
yes i was
we surprised them we were plowing through their defenses and he showed up
Just him against the Watch
he cut us to ribbons
it is how i lost my kidney
he got me with an incredible shot from an old McGraw gauntlet
Wait you want to save him because he shot you
i thought he was gonna finish me off but he did not
what a hero
Look i do not expect you two to understand
and you do not have to come if you do not want to
Get over there Cleo
okay
my guess is he is over there
what we need is some cover fire
that is what i call good timing
that is Jake Lawson
Cleo come on
Get out of the way
Jake Lawson
not me sweetie
no
i am Jake Lawson
you got one thing going for you
that scum out there tried to kill you but i will need a little more to go on before i decide not to waste you myself
we were responding to your distress call Jake
that worked
my apologies Jerbo
sometimes old fashioned technology is the way to go
do you mind telling us why half the scum of the underground is trying to take our heads off
you do not know
Your message was garbled
we did not get all the details
Well let me show you what all the fuss is about
we are talking the big bang
Five hundred years into the future she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth
Mankind has been driven underground
and Cleopatra is about to discover there is no place like home
in the year 2525
there are women with the will to survive
Fighting for a brand new day
Nothing's gonna get in their way
and in the year 2525
Three women keep hope alive
Joining forces to reclaim the Earth
Looking ahead to humankind's rebirth
CLEOPATRA 2525 1x12 THE LAST STAND Subtitles by subXpacio
all those barrels are plutonium
500 years ago
i am marchin' araound with this sign that says
no nukes is good nukes
but does anybody listen
Up until now it is been protected by a force field
but time finally caught up with this place and the force field collapsed
within hours every mercenary was down here
looking to turn a profit on the black market
but you got here first
no
this guy over here beat me to it
but fortunately we have the same goal in mind
we want to keep these weapons out of the hands of that scum out there
so if i can just have that megatronic distributor we can all go home
you did not get that part of the message either
what is a megatronic distributor
it is used to generate force fields
oh like my shield
Exactly
Hey i just got that
Work your magic Jerbo
if you are the tech you claim to be we can all go home real soon
Well do you really expect me to believe you did not know anything about the plutonium
what do you mean
you just fought your way through that heavily armed scum into a hopeless dead end
Nobody does that without a profit motive
Well we do
and if your main concern is getting that force field up then you do too
do i know you
no
but you shot her once
we will help you hold these guys off until Jerbo is finished
you get any sense of how many of them there were
oh i can tell you
they gave me all the sympathy technology
Well it doesn't look so bad there is only five of'em
See that dot waving its arm
oh yeah
does that mean something
uh huh
it means you are pointing it the wrong way
over there
i liked it better the other way
Cleo you'd better shield up
this is gonna get nasty
Jerbo has my shield
then double up
no we are gonna be movin' around too much
now
my shield is not that big
if i knew it would come to this
i would've protested harder
so you are tellin' me i shot you and i did not finish you off
Maybe my laser jammed
Nope
i saw you lay down some suppression fire after you nailed me
i think you gave me a break
i was into some pretty grand gestures in those days
you became kind of a role model for me after that
i asked around about you
learned that you never charged a level too much for protection
never took up a cause unless you believed in it
and you never shot a man in the back
Well that last one's bunk
you know as well as i do
you aim at what they show you front back side
if you can hit it it is fair game
so now you are here to save my butt
i guess it ain't true what they say
what do they say
no good deed goes unpunished
so i shot you with an old McGraw
i would not go around braggin' about that
i have gotten a little better since then
Well prove it
you take the two on the left
Ready
Ready
Nice shooting
Sarge
Sarge
huh
what is in it for him
Same as us
he wants to put the genie back in the bottle
i guess it is hard being a protector when the other side has nuclear weapons
Hmm
no
he just destroyed the relay switch
we needed that to start the force field with a remote control
Did he damage the force field itself
it is fine but now we have to turn it on manually
Damn all i needed was five more minutes
Let me see that
do not panic we will keep the slime out until you are done
after that only one of us has to be here to turn on the force field
Right
so whoever hits that switch will be trapped in here
Hel Cleo
i was the one who brought you guys down here
it is only fair that i be the one to stay
no
i will do it
what are you saying
you are the one who carries the Voice
if we are ever going to take the surface back we need you
if it is really just a matter of pushing a button
we all know who the expendable one is
Short one stays
that settles it
i stay
Jerbo make this thing work
Right
that was an old trick
Cut all the wires so they'd be weak and then you held on extra tight when you pulled yours
Prove it
it is a brave thing you are doing
not as brave as you think
i lied before
i remember you
you were a beautiful fierce young fighter
i just could not stand the thought of killing something that perfect
i used to have a heart back then a soul
but you get hardened after a while
one day i woke up and realized the Jake Lawson you talked about has been dead a long time
i do not know about that
when i heard about this nuke pile
i decided right there and then this would be my last mission no matter how it turned out
this is as good an ending as any
i did it
all right you all need to get going
i will cover you
Thanks Jake for everything
Come on
Keep your head down
Stick close to me
now
i said stick close to me
you can not get much closer than this
we got to get out of here
Come on
Sarge
Goodbye Jake
Sarge
could not we destabilize the force field for a few minutes with an energy neutralizer
i made that impossible by projecting two energy barriers
Even if you neutralized one the other one would expand and take its place
Very good
Thanks
Why do not you two stop stroking your technological egos and focus on getting Jake out of there
Hel i have got good news
Mauser Voice has something
it is a plan of an old ancient mainframe
Look there is an old tunnel that runs under the crypt
yes but it doesn't really help
i am sure your force field projection encircled the entire crypt making any tunnel access useless
Well not exactly
from the beginning Jake suggested that i not project the force field onto the granite floor of the crypt
i could save energy that way
he said only a madman would try to blast his way through a granite floor into a room full of nuclear weapons
Well we can get to Jake through the tunnel
you know this explains everything
i was the first one on the scene
i set up a simple detection beacon to warn me of anyone approaching
then suddenly Jake appeared from deep within the crypt
Scared me to death
i could not figure out how he had gotten in there without my beacon pickin' him up
but he is Jake Lawson so you tend to think he can do anything but he must have come up through the tunnel
but if Jake knew about the tunnel why did not he tell us
Why indeed
Well he did say this would be his last mission no matter what
you were right about one thing the Jake Lawson i talked about has been dead a long time if he ever lived
you figured this out
Very smart
now you be smart and do not go for that weapon
Well what are my alternatives
Walk away
Jerbo comes in and redoes the barrier with the proper equipment
you and i call it even
i can trade this material for an entire level if i want to
i can live like a king
i can hire my own killers to do the dirty work
Walking away is not an alternative
then do what you have to do
you could not shoot me in the back
Just call me sentimental
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeriesArcher to the bridge
Lieutenant Reed sir
what the hell's going on
uh we are having a little trouble with the gravity plating on E Deck
i hope it hasn't caused you any inconvenience
oh no no no
not at all
any idea when you might get it back online
Commander Tucker says it should be any minute now sir
Thank you
it is been a long road Gettin' from there to here
it is been a long time
but my time is finally near
and i will see my dream Come alive at last
i will touch the sky
and they are not gonna Hold me down no more
no they are not gonna change my mind
'Cause i have got faith of the heart
i am going where my heart will take me
i have got faith to believe
i can do anything
i have got strength of the soul
and no one's gonna bend or break me
i can reach any star
i have got faith
i have got faith
Faith of the heart
not a very adventurous breakfast
Plomeek broth is a traditional morning meal on Vulcan
Ah but you are not on Vulcan
you should try these blueberry pancakes
they are quite delicious
i sampled human food on several occasions
it did not agree with me
Give it some time
the Vulcan digestive tract is highly adaptable
i prefer to eat the foods i am accustomed to
there is an old saying
when in Fellebia do as the Fellebians do
it is difficult enough having to smell all this
Eating it is out of the question
Water carbonated
now that is adventurous
we are getting reports from C Deck that it is down to 12 degrees
Ensign Almack is working on it
Well tell him to hurry up
if the relays up there get too cold they are gonna start cutting out on us
Engineering
CREWMAN
we have got a power fluctuation in the starboard nacelle sir
we will get to it as soon as we can
Aye sir
ARCHER
any luck
we know it is got something to do with the plasma exhaust
the flow's been restricted for some reason and it is screwing up half the systems on the ship
Tell Billy to purge the aft manifold
Sir
you think it might be a good idea to drop out of warp
TRlP
Give me a minute sir
i think we can figure it out
Tucker to bridge
might be a good idea to drop out of warp
Going to impulse sir
Commander i think i have found the problem
Something's distorting our wake pattern
TRlP
you are right
the plasma exhaust should not be flaring that close to the ship
REED
EM residue in the exhaust ports
TRlP
no we checked
they are clean
Malcolm if we ignited the plasma exhaust what kind of damage would it do to the nacelles
Sir
how much damage
if we polarize the hull plating it should be all right
as long as we maintained at least half impulse
Go to half impulse ensign
Aye sir
ARCHER
Put up a four
Record all aft sensors
Hull plating
both nacelles are on maximum
Stand by to ignite a charge at 80 metres due aft
Fire
Play it back slowly
Go back and freeze it at the flashpoint
Creep it forward a little
there
Looks like we have got ourselves a hitchhiker
they must be using some sort of stealth technology
i wonder how long they have been there
Long enough to throw half our systems out of whack
i am sure they know we have detected them
Open hailing frequencies
our ship to ship sensors are malfunctioning
i can only give you audio
Translator's active
this is Captain Jonathan Archer of the starship Enterprise
i do not need to tell you where we are
Your presence is disrupting a number of our systems
Please back away to a distance of at least 10 kilometres and respond
harm us
your request
we ask you not to harm us
we are complying with your request
we ask you not to harm us
they are moving off sir
we have no intention of harming you but i would not mind an explanation
i apologize for any damage we have caused
our engines are malfunctioning and we have been using your plasma exhaust to replenish our teraphasic coils
it is allowed us to share your warp field
their warp reactor is off line
we can not help you unless we can see you
so why do not you disconnect whatever stealth device you are using
i am giving you 40 milligrams of mirazine
it should shorten the decompression process by half
that still leaves three hours
can you recommend a good book
i will be briefing you on their propulsion systems
Sure you do not want me coming back at night
Three hours of decompression in each direction makes more sense to stay until the job's done
i have sent them your dietary requirements
they claim to have the ability to synthesize protein and carbohydrates but there is no telling what it may taste like
Try to be diplomatic
Three days on an alien ship
Remember to mind your manners
we have got a seal
TRlP
Just about ready
it is too bad the ship to ship sensors are down
would have been nice to get a look at them
i will just think of it as a blind date
Tucker to Enterprise
Archer
here i go sir
Keep your com channel open
we will be right here
MAYWEATHER
here you go
do not forget to come back for me
i do not know
we are kind of busy
have fun
hello
hello
FEMALE VOlCE
Try to maintain your normal rate of respiration
this stuff's burning my lungs
Maintain your normal rate of respiration
the discomfort will subside
Commander Tucker's calling again sir
he is rather anxious
Put him through
TRlP
how long's it been sir
about five minutes longer than the last time you asked
how is the breathing
a lot easier but i prefer air i can not see
they told us the air would clear up during the last half hour of decompression
i feel like i have been in here for a week
you have only got 45 minutes to go Trip
be patient
Hey
Good boy
there you go
Blue one
Green three
Yellow two
Orange five
Yellow three
Red four green two
Whoa
Whoa
that is too fast
i am not a computer
i hope the acclimation process was not too stressful
Blue three
Yellow six
Orange four
the perceptual tests are the best way to determine whether you are ready for our environment
we have prepared a meal for you
not right now thank you
we strongly recommend that you get some rest
i think I'd like to take a look at that engine room of yours
it is one deck above us
These are the teraphasic coils
the wider ones have lost their cohesion
i am sorry you lost me
i am having trouble concentrating with all this noise and light
are you certain you do not want to rest for a while
i do not know what i am certain about
T'POL
Mr Tucker again sir
Put him through
yeah Trip
how is it going
not good
i do not think i am gonna be much help over here
i am having a little more trouble adjusting than i thought i would
what is the problem
i feel like i have got a fever
i am having trouble focusing breathing
i really think i need to get back captain
Stand by for a minute
T'Pol
Put me through to Trena'l
T'POL
Stand by
TRENA'L
Captain Archer
my man's not doing so well over there
he will be fine
with all due respect i have known Commander Tucker for eight years
he is tough as nails
if he says he is having problems i have gotta believe him
when he came out of decompression he refused to rest
i strongly suggest he'd lie down for a while
you really think that will make a difference
we have a good deal of experience with alien visitors
ARCHER
i told Trena'I you'd try to get at least an hour of shuteye
he says that should do the trick
i just want out sir
i am not kidding
i can not take much more of this
Trena'I says they have dealt with this before
Just one hour
if you are not feeling better we will bring you back
it is not gonna work captain
Take a nap Trip
that is an order
Archer out
we have prepared sleeping quarters for you
it is not far
Your captain sent the recording
he thought it might help you relax
are you feeling better
what is that
our food
it grows all over the ship
would you like some
it is very sweet
i think i will pass
this is the closest we could come to water
Trust me
Hmm
Did that hurt
not really
it is kind of nice
does that happen when you people touch each other
something similar
have you had enough
a man needs a lot of fluids when he is under the weather
if you are feeling well enough we really should get back to the repairs
could we take some of those with us
are the injector cells aligned with the primary coil
TRlP
Aligned and locked
you are not gonna believe this
they have got grass growing on the floor
Real grass
it is even green
is Vulcan grass green
have you tested the ion matrix commander
the grass releases some kind of vapour
Helps them metabolise their food
Smells just like a freshly mowed lawn
the ion matrix commander
oh right
i have recharged the assembly
is it up to 4 yet
Point four three
Keep pumping up the gradient
if we can get it up to 5 the coils should come back online all by themselves
Sounds like Trip's feeling better
before you know it he will have that engine room running like a well oiled machine
Tucker to Captain Archer
Go ahead Trip
we are nearly ready to bring the warp reactor online
should not take more than a couple of hours
Just think yesterday you would have done anything to get out of there
Tucker out
it will take a while for the coils to regenerate
Come with me
there is something i want you to see
Watch this
that is Thera
it is where i come from
TRlP
the depth perception is incredible
what is it a 3 D simulator of some kind
it is holographic
not like any hologram i have ever seen
it seems real doesn't it
how do you
Resequenced photons
Come with me
the perspective's changing
we could walk all the way to the city and you'd never know we are still in this room
Whoa
Sit down
we are still in the same room and this is not a boat
it is a boat
it is just resequenced
Resequenced photons
Exactly
if we had one of these on Enterprise I'd never ask for shore leave
you do not have any dermal plating
how do you detect other people's moods
we do not
Well actually we do but we do it through observing behaviour
Getting to know someone
the follicles on your face if i am not mistaken they have grown
do they have a purpose
not that i know of
Normally we shave them off with something called a razor but i haven't had the chance since i have been here
do you mind
Go ahead
oh
does that hurt
not in the least
more water
no
this is a game we play
Watch
Go ahead
are there any rules to this game
it takes four hands to work
Your favourite food is catfish
how the hell did you know that
what is mine
Your what
Favourite food
yes
Concentrate
what is my favourite food
Dutara root
How'd i know that
i was not certain the granules would work with your species
Captain Archer saved your life once about four years ago
this is one hell of a game
you find me attractive
you like having people find you attractive do not you
sometimes
VOlCE
Reactor Room to Ah'len
the coils are coming back online
Understood
You'd better stand up
Decompression any easier coming back
Three hours is three hours
you can not imagine what it was like over there Travis
Food growing on the walls teraphasic warp coils boxes full of pebbles that make you telepathic
what were the Xyrillians like
uh a little shorter than us weird scales on their faces
but otherwise pretty much like you and me
it sure was something
Reminded me why i signed on
but it is good to be home
Mmm
i hope your mission hasn't been overly delayed
Getting a chance to meet other species is our mission
TRlP
i see you have got the visual back online
Hoshi
Trena'I wanted to thank you again
i realize how difficult it must have been adapting to our environment
Well it was worth every minute
as long as those coils stay charged you should not have a problem maintaining a stable warp field
Thanks for taking care of me when i was not feeling so hot
it was worth every minute
Good luck to you
Nice work commander
i appreciate the opportunity captain
i for one won't miss the malfunctions their proximity was causing
Return to our previous heading Travis
Aye sir
did not they feed you over there
you should've come with me Malcolm
i heard about the holographic recreation
it was not like any visual simulator i have ever tried
it was more like actually being there
you could smell the ocean
Feel the salt air on your skin
if we had one of those onboard
i can only imagine what it would be used for
i do not know if they can recreate people with it but it sure did a hell of a job on landscapes
Make any friends
Ah'len one of their engineers
she is the one who showed me the holographic chamber
is she the one you thanked for taking care of you
yeah
Ah
Interesting scales
she did have a certain sensuality to her
so
Did you get a look at their weapons
i do not even know if they had any
have you tried these scrambled eggs
Tastes just like the real thing today
huh
Maybe you were allergic to something over there
Well i cleared bio scan
Nevertheless you'd better have Dr Phlox take a look at it
TRlP
Far as i know i have never been allergic to anything
i do not believe you are having an allergic reaction
Tell me did your visit to the Xyrillian ship involve any romance
what
were you intimate with anyone
Doc i was over there to repair a warp reactor
what are you talking about
Seems you did a little more than repair work
Meaning
this is a nipple
i beg your pardon
Ah ah
the blastocyst is located between the sixth and seventh intercostals
what the hell are you talking about
i am not quite sure if congratulations are in order commander but you are pregnant
here
do you see that cell cluster
that is the embryo
i assume you will be happy to know that it is not technically your child
what do you mean
when reproducing the Xyrillians only utilize the genetic material of the mother
the males simply serve as hosts
that is comforting
but how the hell did i get knocked up
we do not have any data on their mating procedures but i would not think it would be that difficult for you to recollect a sexual encounter
Three days
you were only there for three days and you could not restrain yourself
i am telling you captain i was a complete gentleman the entire time
i imagine that is a question of how you define gentleman
the only female i had any contact with was Ah'len their engineer
other than repairing the reactor all she and i did together was go into this holographic chamber they have got
she showed me some home movies simulations of their planet
but i did not lay a hand on her
there is gotta be some way to get this thing out of me without hurting it
can not you create a surrogate chamber or something
the embryo has integrated with your pericardium
i would not be comfortable extracting it without more information on the gestation process
this engineer wanted you to see her planet
so
Perhaps the next step would have been to meet her holographic parents
if i am not mistaken on some planets that is a precursor to marriage
we took a ride in a rowboat
i swear captain nothing happened
there had to have been a somewhat lengthy physical contact to transfer this much genetic material
Trip
i have been in Starfleet for 12 years
do you think I'd jeopardize my career by messing around with some alien engineer on a three day mission
i considered myself a diplomat from the minute i set foot in that vessel
Well there was that box of pebbles
Pebbles
yeah she had it on the boat
but it was no big deal
we just stuck our hands into these granules for a few minutes
it is a game they play lets you read each other's minds
they weren't even real they were holographic
just like everything else in the room
Doctor
without a sample of these telepathic granules it would be impossible to make a determination but they could have served as the transferral medium
one of the first things a diplomat learns is not to stick his fingers where they do not belong
Captain
if we are going to safely remove this life form from Commander Tucker we will have to find the Xyrillians
Why do not you and Malcolm see what you can do
about locating their ship
T'POL
yes sir
is Trip well enough to return to his duties
what are you kidding
i am fine
you will probably feel a bit nauseated in the mornings so get sufficient rest and exercise and see me at least once a day
that nipple may not be the only surprise your body has in store for you
you think we could keep this between the four of us
at least for the time being
you got it
Dillard
Sir
Look at this lift
Sir
it is an accident waiting to happen
this safety bar's a metre off the floor
what use would it be for a small person
a small person
a short alien a child
this thing's a deathtrap
Look at this handrail
Put your hands here while this is going up or down it will take your fingers right off
Why would someone put their hands there sir
never mind
ARCHER
Captain's starlog supplemental
we have spent eight days looking for the Xyrillian ship but so far we have had no luck
Sorry i am late
no problem
how you feeling
i thought we all promised to keep this under wraps
i haven't said a thing
Doctor
not a word
i knew it
she probably let it slip the minute she left Sickbay
but Sub commander T'Pol promised to keep your pregnancy a secret
where i am from Vulcans are not known for keeping promises
what makes you think she is told anyone
all you have to do is see the way they whisper talk behind my back
you know what happened this morning
Ensign Hart pulled out my chair for me
i am telling you it was T'Pol and you can be sure it was intentional
what is that
Chicken tetrazzini
Did you cut yourself
i wish
i do not wanna ruin your appetites but take a look at this
Hmm
Just how many of these am i gonna grow
and while we are on the subject are they gonna go away afterward
one would think
then again i have no experience with this species
Great
you know it is been over a week Trip
we have to start considering the possibility that we are not gonna find the Xyrillians
what is that supposed to mean
are you saying i am gonna deliver this baby
i believe he is saying a good deal more than that
Once the child is born it may well rely on you in some way to care for it
i am the chief engineer
i spent years earning that position
i never had any intention of becoming a working mother
you know the doctor was saying that the gestation period will only last another five weeks six at the most
you should expect to begin experiencing some unusual symptoms
Hormonal changes mostly
Mood swings heightened emotions
i suggest you stick with the civilian clothes
Seems to help hide the bulge
how much bigger is this thing gonna get
i am already the laughingstock of the ship
I'd love some more of this
yes sir
I'd like you to start seeing the doctor every eight hours
as your delivery date gets closer he should be able to start figuring out what your postnatal responsibilities might be
Postnatal responsibilities
you may very well be putting those nipples to work before you know it
there is a bright side to all of this
yeah
what is that
as far as we know this is the first inter species pregnancy involving a human
got something
Looks like their signature
Coordinates 078 mark six 3 million kilometres
Change our heading to intercept
Bridge to Archer
ARCHER
Go ahead
we may have found the Xyrillian ship sir
Thank you
on our way
what have you got
we are approaching the coordinates
i have analysed the stealth telemetry i believe it is them
Drop down to impulse
Hoshi try to get an image
Doesn't look very stealthy to me
Go tighter
if the starship profiles the Vulcans gave us are correct
they are correct lieutenant
that is a Klingon battle cruiser
where the hell are the Xyrillians
it appears your repairs did not last very long
if i am correct they are hiding in the Klingons' plasma wake
Hoshi
the translation program should be in pretty good shape sir
Sir with all due respect do we really think this is a wise idea
if we are gonna speak to the Xyrillians we can not do it without the Klingons knowing about it
Open a channel
this is Captain Archer of the starship Enterprise
we respectfully would like to ask for your assistance with a little problem we are
Sir they are charging weapons
Polarize the hull plating
Grab hold of something
and another one
Why are they attacking us
T'POL
they are not
if they wanted to destroy Enterprise they would have done it
so i guess that is their version of a warning shot across our bow
i do not recommend being the recipient of another warning
should i lay in a new course captain
no
Stay where you are
Hail them again
TRlP
Sir look at their starboard nacelle
the power's fluctuating just like ours did when the Xyrillians were riding in our wake
they are responding
what gives you the right to approach a Klingon warship
Please accept our apology
but i need to ask you a question
and what would that be
have you been experiencing any unusual malfunctions
Problems with your gravity plating propulsion environmental controls
you have been monitoring our systems
for how long
we haven't
i promise you
the same things happened to us a few days ago
Your problems are being caused by a small stealth vessel that is been riding in your wake
they are using your plasma exhaust to fuel their warp coils
Find this vessel
Wait a minute wait a minute
they are harmless
we need them
Alive
Just give me a chance to explain
Find them
there are 36 aboard
Bring their captain to me and execute the others
did not you hear what i said
i need them alive
what you need is to turn your puny ship around and leave
These aliens violated our security and disrupted our systems
both are considered acts of war against the Empire
i assure you that any damage they have done was unintentional
they are simply trying to get home
they won't get home
but i am more than willing to hasten their journey to Sto Vo Kor
Sto Vo
the afterlife
you really do not wanna hurt these people
they are actually very kind
they just had some bad luck with their engines
when we confronted them they complied with all our requests
you are wasting my time
less than one month ago
Captain Archer stood in the High Council Chamber in Kronos
the chancellor himself called him a man of honour
a brother
Enterprise is the ship that found Klaang and returned him to the Empire
without Klaang your houses would be at war with each other
Jonathan Archer is the man who carried out that rescue
you are in his debt
you would be demonstrating both honour and wisdom to grant his request
i am the one who repaired their warp reactor
or at least i thought i did
i spent three days on their ship
they have some amazing technology
if you do not kill them i am sure they'd share it with you
teach you how to use it
what kind of technology
Well for one they have got some incredible holography
i do not know how advanced Klingon holograms are but these are like nothing i ever saw before
Press a few buttons you will be standing on a hillside overlooking Kronos
it is unbelievable
could not hurt to take a look
Unless the decompression cycle frightens you
i am frightened by nothing P'tok
if you agree to enter their vessel
I'd appreciate it if you'd take my chief engineer with you
he talks too much
i will bring a security team
he was there for three days
they trust him
it will make things a lot easier
if their technology amuses me i may spare their lives
i do not need your engineer to help me make that decision
there is another reason
Commander Tucker has some unfinished business with the Xyrillians
i am not interested in your engineer's business
there is a pregnancy involved
i thought you said you were there to fix their warp reactor not to impregnate one of their females
this should be a lesson to you
Forget it happened
i am afraid that is not gonna be so easy
Show him
TRlP
Captain Vorok has agreed to consider releasing your ship in exchange for one or two of your holographic simulators
it would be a good idea to cooperate
this is a topographical survey of our capital
I'd be pleased to give you a demonstration
the reactor worked fine for six days then went off line again
how did you find us
it was not easy but we were very um motivated
i do not understand
AH'LEN
i had no idea this could happen with another species
if I'd known
no need to apologize
but i would be real appreciative if you could get this out of me assuming it is safe
it is still early enough to transfer the embryo to another host
Hmm
she looks very healthy
it is a girl huh
uh huh
i can see my house from here
can this technology be adapted to our power matrix
i am sure we can make the appropriate modifications
as soon as the installation is complete
the Xyrillians will be free to go
i appreciate your cooperation
i hope the next time we meet we can be of some help to you
Listen to me very carefully
our debt is repaid
we have no interest in meeting you again
and if we do i promise you will regret it
the only thing worse than spending three hours in a decompression chamber with a bunch of Klingons is doing it twice in one day
i smelled things in there i hope i never smell again
Trena'I told me that at full impulse they can probably get home in less than a month
no more hitchhiking
Mmm
that business about the Klingon chancellor calling me a brother was that true
Klingons are known to exaggerate
i saw nothing wrong with doing the same
Your appetite seems to be back to normal
Just eating for one again
i have run a check through the Starfleet database
you might be pleased to know that this is the first recorded incident of a human male becoming pregnant
Just how i always wanted to get into the history booksHey hand me a gigger
uh that would be your word for this
what the hell was that
the trick of fishing with explosives the element of surprise
Explosives
yeah
you did not think we were going to sit here for hours with poles and like talk
Three fish
not a lot of bang for your bang
all right
fire in the hole
See better than two poles in six hours
is that
no way
do not touch it Bart
we were cherry bombing the shallows for fish and as in illegal explosives
no one was around
i mean
the girl in the car might disagree her arm you know with no hand and i dove in
if someone was down there it was like some dead chick inside she was tied at the driving wheel with the tape
she is dead she is dead
Well good i tell you something stay here for a second
what are you thinking Horatio
there may be a fingerprint preserved inside this duct tape
Check that please would you
Horatio you recognize the make and model
i recognize more than that Frank
this is Kathleen Newberry
she is been missing for over a week
where is Kathleen Julia
Why are you asking me that
Kyle got out of prison because Julia Winston paid her a million reasons to disappear
any sign of the money Frank
no
she had a fast car and a bag of money
she could've ended up anywhere
Anywhere but here
Team CSI MlAMI experts heberg forum net
Always makes me nervous when the crowd is so close
there is not a lot of dry land to stand on here
it is a bit tight today
yeah but it is just such a gruesome thing to watch
i do not know
Something's off
what is that
her sunpass is missing
Remember we tracked her as far north as boca
yeah and then her car ended up all the way back down here
yeah that doesn't add up
all right we still have the court order to check the sunpass archives
it might be worth looking into
yeah maybe the killer made a mistake
the sunpass could take us right to him
i will call it in
so what do you got
i happened to catch a glimpse of this blonde hair in the zipper here
may i
Finish what you started
this obviously is not hers
what was the cause of death
Well her lungs are full of water
she drowned
but the bruising on her wrists and knees indicate she struggled before losing consciousness
so she was alive when she went down
yeah
i will have it in a bit
okay great
i am going to go run this in the meantime
Thanks
Somehow i knew you would not stay away Horatio
we found Kathleen Newberry's body Julia
i never even met her
my assistant Pamela gave her my care package
a 1 million care package
Enough for her to start a new life and get our son out of prison
the money is gone
i watch the news
do you i think i am capable of tying her to her car and pushing it into the everglades
we recovered your fingerprint on the tape that was used to bind her body
anyone could have taken it from my home
there are a lot of people out there with motive to frame me
i am looking at one right now
you are still mad Kyle chose me over you
Julia you are in deep trouble
i did not kill her
Why can not you just believe me
because i haven't heard the truth yet
Waiting on a result
as usual
you hear about Julia
we found her print on the tape that bound Kathleen
not surprised
last time i saw her she implied that we weren't going to see Kathleen Newberry again
so what you are hoping to tie this hair back to her
yeah case closed and H gets Kyle back in his life
yeah
is it Julia
no
but you know what it is the next best thing
it is Pamela's her assitant
i am going to go pay her a visit
i quit working for Julia right after she got custody of Kyle
she fire you
no
you know as well as i do she is dangerous
i left on my own accord
you did not leave because you got yourself a big payday
what are you talking about
i am talking about your hair that i found on Kathleen Newberry's body and the million dollars that i did not find
i did not steal any money
the last time i saw her was when i gave her Julia's gift
it is a shame what happened to her
how do you think your hair got on her
she hugged me right before she left town
how can i ever thank you
and it clung to her this whole time
Hey you are the scientist
and you are the suspect again
Mind telling me how you paid for all of this
if there is one thing i learned from Julia it is how to invest wisely
i am sure that is not the only thing you learned from Julia
Hey how is it going
Hey did Delko remember to touch base with you about the sunpass court order
yeah he did and they are sending the records over
and i am gonna go over to the garage to process the Newberry car
Did you get the photos from the crime scene this morning
i did
i am just about to download them
okay
Great
Wait a minute
oh my god
what is wrong Calleigh
all of my crime scene photos are gone
they are gone
what do you mean they are gone
Let me see
Well they are not gone they are black
Did you remember to take the lens cap off the camera
yes
of course i did
okay what does that mean
what is this
this memory disc is not department issue
Did you let the camera out of your sight at any point this morning
no
i mean i may have set it down for a second at the scene
do you think somebody swapped it out
there is some prints on this
i think somebody is trying to sabotage our case
so what do you recall about the car after it was recovered
Well all of the doors were shut except for the driver's side of course that is where the victim was removed
the trunk was only slightly ajar not open
Hey Calleigh come here and take a look at this
See this here
Somebody tampered with the lock
here you go
Thank you
it looks like
looks like a piece of metal
you know i think that happened after it was submerged
that looks like the tip of a fishing spear
the guys that found her body were fishing
Duncan i am coming in
what are you doing man
they are cops and they have warrants
so you guys stole the money out of the trunk
all right look i am pre law
i know about Florida's salvage rules
it is finders keepers
then i am sure you also know all about what it is like to interfere with a murder investigation
all right when you guys were there did you happen to steal anything else
Like what
Like anything
Evidence a digital camera memory card
Did you take a sunpass
um no
no
Well you just lied to me 15 seconds ago pretty convincingly so i do not know why i should believe you right now
he is not lying
okay save it you guys
we already know that you have been lying
if you are willing to steal money from a dead woman then obviously you are willing to take evidence to cover your tracks
here is what is going to happen
we are going to confiscate every computer every digital camera and every cell phone until we find the evidence that is ours that is missing
Look we are just two guys in the wrong place
Actually you are two guys in the center of a murder investigation
you are both under arrest
Kyle
how are you
Just been trying to settle down trying to sort everything out in my head
can i help you with that
Look why are you still harassing mom
you do not really think that she killed that woman
Son that woman lost her life
Look please just leave her alone dad
i can not do that son
Look okay she is really really scared dad okay
i can tell that she is scared and she doesn't want to admit it and it has to be because of you
but she has no reason to be afraid of me
but she is
are you sure that is what is going on
do not try to con me okay
i came here
and said what i needed to
i am done
Keep your voice down
i have said what i came here to say
okay i am not going to let you use me against her
i can not believe we have gone through all of Bart and Duncan's stuff and we still haven't found the memory card
i know i was kind of hoping that we'd find
Kathleen Newberry's sunpass in all this stuff
Department of transportation did give us access to all their records and believe it or not they have a license plate camera at all their tollbooths
oh great well let's just hope whoever was using it hasn't stopped
will you pull up all of the tollbooths that the sunpass has gone through
Hey check your e mail
Solve a crime with Calleigh
what is this
i do not know but this web link has been sent to everybody in the lab's e mail
is it some sort of a joke
i do not think anyone's laughing
Come here
Solve a crime with Calleigh or not
do you want to see how one of Miami's top CSls really solves her cases
Keep checking back and see the latest bungle Calleigh Duquesne tries to cover up
will you play the video
Sure
that looks like Delko's handwriting
that is so weird
the video makes it look like you need help remembering how to process a crime scene
Let's just move on from it okay
that video looks like it was taken by somebody in the crowd
Wait a minute
there is a comments section
some pretty creepy things are already being posted about you
Wait
Look at that picture
that angle could not be taken from the crowd
that is from my camera
so whoever swapped the memory car is not trying to sabotage the case they are messing with me
all right let's just narrow it down
it is clearly not
Bart and Duncan'cause you can not send e mail from booking
what i can do is i can take the e mail address and i can follow it back to a web site
no you know what
Let's just leave it alone because i do not want these pranks to mess up the case
Calleigh i am sorry but the memory card says different
Evidence has been compromised here so we need to resolve this if we are going to protect the investigation
okay but let's just get back to the sunpass for a minute
Please
okay
i plotted the usage of Kathleen Newberry's sunpass
Whoever has it hasn't been shy and they have been using a regular route
this is the last tollbooth they have been through
can we pull up those license plate photos
yeah we are lucky we have them
' cause the Department of transportation usually throws them away right away
that is a semi
a semi explains why it is been through so many tollbooths
i am gonna go talk to Tripp and have him bring the truck driver in
Thank you
who the hell are you
Your nightmare
Get your butt down here
is there uh some kind of problem
Hey you can not go through my truck
you Ted Wallace
yeah
this warrant says we can
you sure you are not Kathleen Newberry
you got her sunpass
you are a suspect in a murder investigation
i do not know anything about a murder
i drive my routes and i keep to myself
yeah well how'd you come across Kathleen Newberry's sunpass then
i found it
where
here
I'd always bed down here before i pick up at the port
i found it laying on the ground about a week ago
i thought I'd save a few bucks on tolls
you can not arrest me for not calling it in to lost and found
Lost and found
a woman's dead
we are locking up your truck
you are going to take a little ride
you know Kathleen's body was not found too far from here just a few miles
Think she stopped here on her way out of town and got picked off by our trucker
i do not know by who but i know where i am gonna look first
Well the heaviest traffic area at all these rest stops the restrooms
a lot of people have been in and out of here since Kathleen Newberry disappeared
Think there is any evidence left
Well these places are not exactly known for their cleanliness
Towel dispenser's damaged
Maybe a struggle
got something here
got a faint sweet smell
i bet you it is chloroform
so she was subdued
yeah
the killer took her car drove a few miles to the glades taped her up and then he drowned her
that explains the how but not the who
got some dried blood over here too
Well like i told you these places are not known for their cleanliness
we found your blood out at the rest stop Ron
oh i i know what it was
it was the uh it was the uh towel dispenser
you know
it was not working
and i grabbed for it and i i cut myself
so a woman was killed out there and you have a record
yeah i am in the system for uh real estate fraud
Real estate fraud and now murder Ron
that is not a cut
it looks like a bite mark
oh i am not sure you can tell either way
but i told you what happened
that is what happened
and now i am gonna tell you what i think happened
you subdued Kathleen Newberry Ron
she bit you
you drove her out to the Everglades and then killed her
i am gonna ask you a question that my lawyer will
can you prove that
that is what i do
this is everything i have on Julia
she is had numerous run ins with the law
nothing ever stuck
has the name Ron Saris been mentioned yet
yeah as a matter of fact
she was using one of her aliases but they were both brought in in St Augustine for questioning about a charity scam five years ago
Five years ago no charges were filed were they
no
what else
nothing else about Ron Saris
but um there is something else you should know
what is it
Julia came to me
someone must have tipped her off that i was looking into her
Horatio she asked me to work for her
Work on what
Specifically about Marisol
and why you went to Brazil
she learned you had some trouble down there so she wanted details
Details
i never asked you about what happened in Rio
anyway i
i would not help her
i told her i would not help her
Horatio i
i do not trust this woman
and i do not think she is one to give up easily
Neither am i
Julia did Ron Saris murder Kathleen Newberry
i haven't seen or heard from Ron in six years
Five years
it is been five years
and Ron is back in town and i think you are in contact with him
we all have skeletons in our closet
but i have left mine behind for Kyle
i do not think you can say the same thing
as it turns out i did not need your P i Friend's help after all
in Rio money can buy a lot of information
you murdered this man
Julia this is not going to work
Leave me alone
Ryan what are you doing on Calleigh's web site
Someone's interfering with an investigation and i am going to figure out who it is
there are over 10 000 hits
i thought that e mail only went out to us lab rats
yeah well it went viral hence my urgency
Well can not you just look up who the site is registered to
i did
it is Sir Berners Lee
he created the internet so obviously that is a fake
i also followed a bunch of ip addresses it all pretty much
led to nowhere
Wow someone's really covering their tracks
yeah
if we are going to find this guy we are gonna have to find him on his level
Meaning
the source code
that gobbledygook make sense to you
yeah those numbers control the background color and the text
and that one's for the video player
Like how Youtube works
yeah but this is a different Flash video player
in fact
aside from a couple of tweaks it is exactly like the one we use
so
that is custom coded for us
by who
Hey Calleigh it is me
yeah i know who is messing with you
Hey Cooper
Come right on in Cal
Why are you doing this
Doing what
this
i always wanted to start a web site
now i finally have the time
Thanks to you by the way
okay look i understand that you are angry
i also understand that you blame me for losing your job
i am not angry
i used Speedle's credit card you caught me
the lab cannot afford judgment errors by its employees
i am just trying to insure that
you do realize that destroying crime scene photos is an obstruction of justice do not you
something happen to your photos
my memory card was swapped but you already know that because i have already seen my crime scene photos on your web site
Web site's a public forum
any user can post a comment or photo
you can search my place if you want to
but thank you
now i have got my next post for the site
okay you know what Cooper
when you were fired i opted not to press charges
Please do not force me into rethinking that decision okay
i haven't done anything wrong
None of this is against the law
you are not that guy
you made one mistake
do not make it worse
i will see you at the next crime scene
i really hope you do not
is that Kathleen Newberry's shirt
as a matter of fact it is
See once it dried the pattern revealed itself
you see this discoloration right here
Looks like the tread from a boot
what i initially thought was a v is actually a W
and that is the logo for Woodridge hunting boots
yes it is
the stain has diesel fuel in it
Fortunately that fuel preserved the pattern for us
Let's bring in Mr Ted Wallace
Woodridge hunting boots
Ted pal
this is not your lucky day
are we still talking about that dead girl in the car
we are Ted
Check your notes from our last chat man
all right i happened to find this woman's sunpass
that is where my story ends
Well you better start telling us something Ted
like how your boot print ended up on Kathleen Newberry's shirt
i i do not know
i have been in that restroom a million times
Maybe i tracked something in and she fell on my boot print
i am not your guy
Well who is my guy then
all right look he had a sunpass in one hand and five thou cash in the other
all i got to do is take my rig up north and take his sunpass with me
Look at these guys
can you identify him amongst these men too
no man they could've been kermit the frog
Ted pal do me a favor really take a look
Maybe this guy
all i cared about was the cash
was he with a woman
no
at the time it seemed like easy money
i sure did not think it was tied to any killing
Well we all make mistakes Ted this is yours
Take him please
Julia
hello Horatio
Ron saris is about to go down for the murder of kathleen newberry
Bring him in please
i can not do that Horatio
he is going to take you down too
you know
Julia i am sick of this
we have been doing this your way up until now
now we are going to do it my way
he is dead dead dead
Wait
you you can not just kill a cop
you
Why are you protecting him
Why
Come on
Ron
you still love him do not you
Ron
Tell me look at me
you still love him do not you
that is what it is
no come on
Look
look i can make him disappear
Come on R on
Tell me
i just need to make one call
yeah
i only want to be with you
yeah well that is all i have ever wanted was to be with you
i need to speak with who is in charge
where is Ron Julia
i asked you to let this go Horatio
you are protecting a murderer
what does he have on you
this has nothing to do with him
Julia
i want to help you but this is going to be my last chance
i do not need your help
besides it is too late
oh i am sorry Horatio
you may not understand this now but it is for your own good
U S Marshal's office just notified us a judge just granted a warrant for your arrest
Granted to who
Brazilian federal police
they are en route to take you into custody
you are being extradited to Brazil this afternoon
they are charging you with murder Horatio
Horatio i want you to know that we are going to be here for you no matter what
we need to stay focused on the newberry case
okay
i just got a call on a possible lead
i am going to head there now
we will hold down the fort
I'd appreciate that ma'am
you go voluntarily you wave your right to fight extradition
it is not going to make a difference Rick
that won't be necessary
Lieutenant Caine you ready
yes sir
Let's go
Natalia what are you doing
this is exactly what Cooper wants
i know
i know
i am sorry
it is just that you know this is really scary because we are not the only people who can see this
the criminals could be studying this
and studying us
he is at it again
Wait a minute
i thought that she talked to him
yeah well he obviously did not listen
' cause he just updated the web page
what a spider
Black widow
what is that supposed to mean
this southern belle has a deadly bite
John hagen a decorated homicide detective
performed his own little Duquesne mutiny'
by committing suicide in this venomous little CSl's very own firearms lab
oh my god
has cooper lost his mind
no but he is escalating
is calleigh in the lab
uh no
the last i heard she went out to follow a lead on the newberry case
you have reached CSI Calleigh Duquesne with damn it it is going straight to voicemail
it means her phone's off
that is not like her
no that is not good
what are you doing
Checking the GPS tracker on her Hummer
he could not have sent her out on a fake call
she just had her number changed
yeah he could have
he posted her new number
where is she
i do not know
what the hell are you doing huh
what are you doing Cooper
i was just having a little bit of fun man all right
little miss perfect needed to be taken down a notch or two
so i videotaped her
so what
Videotape
you have been harassing her on the web site and now she is missing
Well Calleigh's a big girl she can take care of herself
she can take of herself
you posted her new number on the web site
it is not against the law
yeah
what if some felon what if some felon calls her out to a location huh
you think about that
yeah that is what i thought
if something happens to her Cooper i am going to come back here and kill you
Lieutenant Caine
i have to admit
i never thought we'd see you back in Rio
Why am i here
we needed time to build a case
and somebody made it worth your while right chief
i do not like what you are implying
you hunted down and killed Antonio Riaz
that is why you are here
he murdered my wife
and so you murdered him
Chief let's just say that Mr Riaz got what was coming to him
You'd testify to that
in a real court i might
no courtroom is necessary
i just wanted to hear you admit it
i admitted to nothing
so what happens now
it is very simple
as far as i am concerned
you are free to go
Just like that huh
yes
Just like that
but
you should know you made a lot of enemies the last time you were in Rio
and this is your way of saying Good luck
i admit to nothing
but Good luck

Whistling
Bottles rattle

Refrigerator door closes
Today is baby day for spirit week so me Sean and Darrin are rockin' the diapers
Baby seniors rule
Rattles
Hey uh if you get a chance today you wanna stop by the College Center and find out why we haven't heard from East Indiana yet
Mom a lot of people haven't heard anything yet all right
you do not have to worry about this
i got it under control
i am practically an adult so
Ah
Good thing you are wearing those diapers dude
' cause guess who just got accepted to Notre Dame
Wow
Maybe you will date a leprechaun
it is not just him
you are looking at two pillars of higher education
i just got my fat envelope from Midwest Institute of Air Conditioning Repair
first choice
all right so what is the story with you man
you get the good news from East Indy yet
uh nah
nothing official but the recruiter pretty much told me it is a lock so Chuckles i am not sweating it
yeah
no worries
if it doesn't happen i could probably get you in at MlACR
i am a legacy
all right men uh enough college talk
Let's talk about something really important
our senior prank
yeah
i am not sure i am really feeling a prank this year
we are seniors
when else are we gonna do it
i just do not feel like it' kay
do not get your diapers in a twist
they are not diapers
they are adult comfort shorts
my grandpa wears'em when he plays golf
School bell rings
you know how Sue was usually invisible to teachers
Well this year she finally got noticed by one
the bell has rung people
the school may find it amusing to have you all dressed up and run around like little babies but in my class you will be treated like the young adults you claim to be
Miss Heck next time you write an essay for my class
let's try using one color ink instead of 20
Pens clatter
oh and i hate to rain on your parade but perhaps it is time to stop dotting your i is with little hearts
Paper rustles Students chuckle and murmur
Silence
Students gasp do any of you have the desire to think outside yourselves and to contribute to the world you live in
Somebody say yes i do
yes i do
no you do not
you are all pleasure seekers
it is me me me 24 7
you get upset if the battery in your phone dies
but did you know that Alessandro Volta invented the battery in 1800
Well of course you do not
you think it was invented by a little pink bunny who goes around banging away on a big bass drum
now for your next assignment you will propose an hypothesis
you will design and produce an experiment to test said hypothesis and determine whether to accept or reject it Pen clicks and i want this question to come from your soul
where is your passion
what do you care about
what are you really interested in
the answer is not gonna be on your computer or your television
he is not gonna pop up for you in an app
this project is 40 of your grade
so as you Americans say you had better get crackin'
Hair dryer whirring
Dad can you please get me an iPad
i am heating up my coffee with a hair dryer
what do you think
Hair dryer turns off Electricity crackles
i do not think you realize what getting me an iPad would mean
for example when we go on trips you would not have to lug around all my books
Remember that time you threw out your back while picking up my book bag
Door opens the answer's still no but thanks for reminding me i am old
Door closes Sighs
Well
anything in the mail
Just bills
you know it would not just be for me
the whole family could use it
Sighs
are we still talking about that iPad
you know it was funny the first 70 times
now it is starting to get old
we should have heard by now
the guy made it sound like it was locked up
i gotta tell you Frankie i am getting a little nervous here
you know what
there is a little hope
Refrigerator closes one of the girls in my dental materials class said that her sister applied to East Indy about the same time as Axl and she still hasn't heard yet either
Hmm
if i get lost on my way to school and need directions Sighs there is an app for that
Why are we still talking about this
Go away
but dad you are not letting me prove my
Go
Hair dryer resumes whirring Hair dryer turns off
Sighs
Brad
how would you like to be the first subject in my science experiment
are you kidding
I'd be honored
but i should warn you i can not tolerate needles or tickling
we should be good
okay
i will smile at you and then if you smile back at me that proves my hypothesis that smiling is contagious
Love it
you will be subject X
the first entry in my log
Ready
Ready
Brad
yeah
i think you have to stop smiling
otherwise when i smile at you
we won't know if you smile back
oh right
of course
okay i am ready
Go
oh
Damn it Bradley
Why can not you do this
you went to drama camp for God sake
it is not your fault Brad
the reason this is not working is because i told you the experiment
i was just so excited i had to share
but i tainted the results
you know what
i need to test my hypothesis on strangers
Good luck
Indistinct conversations
so while Sue was trying to prove smiling is contagious
Mike and i were proving being nervous definitely was
anything yet
Still waiting
i do not get it
we should have heard something by now
you know that lady in my class
her sister got accepted to East Indiana today
Crap
Well let's just agree whatever happens he is not living in our house next year
i think i should call the coach and see what is going on
no we can not do that Mike
we do not wanna be those parents
Gasps
Engine turns off
Afternoon folks
Chuckles Laughs
oh come on
Mama needs a fat envelope
Beautiful day today huh
yeah whatever
you got anything else in there for us
Nope
that is it
uh you know what
how about i just take a little look myself
oh ma'am that is a federal offense
Hey look there is a mean dog
Ma'am i have got to get back on my route
there are other citizens who are counting on me
Starts engine oh what are you Batman
Let me see in the damn bag
Man shouts indistinctly Tires squeak
this is my son's future we are talking about
i know it is in there
i know you have it
we never got the Andersons' Christmas card
two weeks later and still nothing new with the mail
Well not exactly nothing
i can not believe they switched our mailman
what are they worried about me for
they are the ones that go postal
not now Sue
you can dust all you want Brick
you are not getting an iPad
so while Mike and i had been harassing the loyal servants of the US Postal Service turns out it was not the'80s anymore and the news we were all waiting for was coming over a different kind of mail
Cell phone buzzing
yes
i am in
oh my God
i just got an official e mail from East Indiana State
it is official
i am in
oh my God
that is it
i am outta here
so long suckers
East Indiana State freshmen rule
High pitched voice Ha ha ha ha
Whoo
i still have to graduate do not i
no
but this kid in my class Brian Becker got one and now everybody flocks around him
and he is got a restless leg and he suffers from early onset alopecia
i am just saying you guys are always on me to make friends
yeah it is a great way to make friends but you are not getting an iPad
so i was talking to mom about the iPad and she thinks it'd be a great way for me to make friends
Tv playing indistinctly Friends
i thought you wanted this thing for school
Dad liked your friend idea but he thinks the iPad should be used more for school
you are doing fine in school
yeah but in middle school the workload really picks up
Well if it is for middle school we will talk about it when you get to middle school
Mom says she sees it as more of a middle school thing
yeah well middle school is a long way off is not it
Door closes Dad's on board with getting the iPad
but he thinks middle school is a long way off
Really
he really said that
Hey mom
can we go to Red Lobster for dinner tonight
no
yeah that is what dad said
he absolutely said that
Why not
you are always saying we should do more as a family
we are gonna do something as a family
we are eating defrosted pot pies from the Frugal Hoosier and watching Dance Moms
yeah i just do not think that is a very good idea for tonight
so since dad thought middle school was so far away
i was just thinking you guys could give me the iPad for my graduation present
Sighs are you still talking about this
would not red lobster be a great place for the family to talk about their day
Singsongy you know in case somebody has some news
what do you think
Graduation gift
i do not know Brick
we will see
we will see for graduation
Sure
do not believe her Brick
we will see is mom for we are never going out to eat
' cause for some reason we hate our kids and delicious reasonably priced seafood
is that true mom
Stop bugging me both of you
we are not talking about the iPad and we are not going to Red Lobster
Look i never claimed to be strong
it really has something for everybody
i mean mom you can watch the Bachelor anytime you want
and dad you can no one cares Brick but i think people might be quite interested in this news
i am sitting in class today when my phone buzzes
and i notice i have an e mail that says Excuse me
can i get you folks started with some drinks
um we will have a couple of pops and water for these people
can i interest anyone in some bacon wrapped shrimp tonight
you wrap anything in bacon we will eat it
as i was saying Allow me to show you this Powerpoint presentation of why i should get my iPad now instead of waiting for graduation
Graduation
what are you talking about
Mom said i could get one for graduation
now keep in mind that this would look a lot better if it were presented on an actual iPad
you said that
what is the matter with you
i do not know
he was bugging me when i was trying to study
i probably just said it to get rid of him
Mutters what
Axl Speaking of graduation
i have some interesting news
Today in class i am People  Happy birthday to you   Happy birthday to you   Happy birthday dear Betty   Happy birthday to you  Applause Crying

we are gonna
Cement a golf cart to the stairs

Darrin
Sorry
i just love guessing
Gentlemen we are going to climb the Orson water tower and use paint to change the word Orson to preemptive high five
Snore son
Dude
that is epic
yeah
and then right beneath snore son we are gonna write 2013 seniors rule
and do you know why
because both Seniors rule
huh
both grunt yes
Let's do this  Ahh 
Well i trust that all of you are well ensconced in your experiments
now when i call your name you will state your hypothesis and bring me up to date on your experiment
Miss Heck
Well um
Well um is not an hypothesis
Miss Moore
my hypothesis is that some marinade ingredients might block carcinogenic compounds from forming on meat when it is grilled
i am currently looking at which ingredients would inhibit
PHlP formation' cause if i can find a way to decrease carcinogens from our diet
i might have found a way to prevent cancer
Whew
Miss Heck
um well my hypothesis is that smiling is contagious
Laughter Exhales deeply it is more than you think
you see the purpose of this project is to prove that when one individual smiles it will elicit a similar smile from another human thereby decreasing levels of worldwide unhappiness
Well then
the rest of you will have to tell me your hypothesis later because i have to dust off the Nobel prize for Miss Heck
Let me warn you if this is the direction you are going you better wow me
Smile playing
Man  Smile though your heart is aching  Crying  Smile even though it is breaking   when there are clouds in the sky   you will get by 
Well i am gonna hit the hay
Good night
Whoop
Good night
Good night
oh
Mm
Did you notice Brick hasn't asked about the iPad in two days
75 times a day for a month and then nothin'
Go figure
huh
i think he finally got the message that when we say no we mean it and you know what is that called
uh a miracle
Nope
that is called good parenting
Truth is they are actually not that expensive
what
Well i saw one for 87 bucks on eBay
i saw one for less than that
first Generation Refurbished
i guess it was in some kind of fire
Mm
the thing is he does read a lot
if we got him one i am not saying we would we would never have to buy him another book
or drive him to the library
he really is a great kid
he doesn't ask for a lot
he is willing to share it
he said himself
the whole family could use it
and since Axl got that scholarship we do have a little bit of cash
can you imagine how surprised he'd be
if we actually gave it to him
He'd go nuts
Let's do it
Man Timber
Train whistle blowing in distance Clank Ha ha ha
Laughs
Whoo
Seniors rule
Laughs Ahh
Wow
Whoa
Letters are huge
Hells yeah they are
that is why tomorrow the whole city is gonna see the greatest senior prank in the history of prankage
Laughs
Hey look it says class of'92 seniors rule
Scoffs how can that be
yeah
we will paint over that
okay let's do this
yeah
where is the paint
uh oh
what
Darrin the last time you said uh oh the paramedics had to cut my jeans off me
i forgot the paint
Dude your your family owns a paint store
Sighs i think i might have a sharpie
do you know how long it would take to write snore son with a sharpie
Three days
a week
no
Stop guessing
Sighs
Clatters
so much for being legendary
Whoa
Check it out
i think i can see your house
Really
Right there
Hey there is the Meenahans' house
oh
Laughs oh
Laughs you remember after they moved we snuck into their yard and dared this guy to jump from their oak tree to their roof
i have never seen anyone hit a sidewalk that hard
i remember that
i will never forget that
i do not remember that
Whoa is that the school
it looks so tiny from up here
yeah
Felt so big when we were freshmen
and there is the football field
yep
you always said that we'd win a city championship on that field and we did
you also said you'd feel Julie O'Connor's boobs on that field
Mm
Well one for two ain't bad huh
you only felt one of'em
Sighs Remind me not to have you fix my air conditioner
Snorts
Chuckles
Hmm
can not believe we are done
what do you mean done
in a couple months we are all gonna be going to different schools
Hmm
you know what
i am glad Darrin forgot the paint
' Cause Orson was never snore son while we were here
Damn straight
we rocked this town
Epic
Laughs Clatter
i just lost a shoe
Well how did we do Miss Heck
i guess you will tell me
Class while i grade all your fine work you can continue reading chapter 23
if you finish you can proceed to chapter 24
Pen clicks Sue is smiling contagious
after many attempts with multiple subjects including family friends a Red Lobster waitress and an unfriendly baby
i unfortunately was unable to prove my hypothesis
however like many scientists before me
i refuse to admit defeat
it took Einstein ten years to prove Emc2 and if it takes me that long to prove smiling is contagious then i am up for the challenge for i believe there are some things that defy logic
no way
an iPad
and it is the one from the fire
Laughs oh this is better than being a good parent
French anatomist Duchenne wrote that
Joy is expressed on the face by contraction of the muscles but it can only be put in play by the sweet emotions of the soul
Gonna miss you guys
okay
i am just gonna say it
i love you
oh
oh i okay Darrin just made it weird
i am sorry
Voice breaking i am very emotional right now
yeah
Dude come on man
Laughs
and Duchenne had a whole smile named after him
Think of the smiles over the years that have inspired a whole world to happiness
Mona Lisa's Justin Bieber's
some might laugh at me i know just as they laughed at John Gurdon
he was told in high school that he would never be a scientist
he just won the Nobel prize
i guess it just proves that being dismissed by people who think they know better is not an obstacle to winning a Nobel prize
so i will continue with my research one smile at a time until i prove that smiling is contagious
'cause i do not wanna live in a world where it is not

it is one room
i will keep it going till dad gets home

Enough time to hate good and hard

Your father proud of his uniform
other people like Jim Farraday never even wore one
he never was in the army
but he is young and he is certainly able bodied
he is a fine specimen
it is for religious reasons

he is anti war on just straight physical grounds
he just do not like the idea of getting shot at
Maybe even killed

you with your nursing home
us with Doc Sunderland's Muscle Builder

Benjy

Ladies and gentlemen i will tell you what we are going to do

Miss Curtis

Well it might have been east or northeast
Why
Just curious
for a man who spends 300 to keep from fighting he
General Sheridan scores victory in Northern Virginia
the Rebs ain't running faster than that soldier you worked over
Mister

Six bits for every bottle you bust

i am warning you to be careful
Lieutenant let's see what is in here
Sergeant

the lieutenant came in like he was Christopher Columbus discovering America
he called me pop
Yankees never had no manners
Easy
i had a brakeman for a husband
he never made enough to buy the meat
oh do not have a brakeman for a husband
or this is all you will ever get to eat
Tapioca tapioca
all he ever could afford was tapioca
by the potful by the carload
but it came to an end i am a widow again
Take me on the railroad take me far away
Johnny pick a tune on your banjo
Listen to the wheels go clacking on their way
Tapioca tapioca tapioca they seem to say
Forgive this intrusion but being in the same business
Run along i am spoken for
i know an artist like you would be surrounded by admirers
no more
i got myself a steady
i am deeply envious of him
it was the coincidence of your song that brought me here
what coincidence
we have been using that song for months
Am i supposed to cut it out
not at all
the way you sing it you are entitled to it
i thought you wanted trouble
Quite the contrary
i really put it over
Hmm big
should i do it regular
did not you sing it before
first time
it was a request
do you recall who requested it
my steady
Sally ask Mr Farraday to come in
Won't you come in
here is that drink we did not have
Sally find another home
i won't be in the way
i said find yourself another home
Sure sweetie i do not mind
i will be with Laura
if you want me knock on the wall
Sally
yes
Close the door
i am the man to take you through the Union lines
here is to a no trouble trip
you are talking way over my head
Farraday let's drop the games and save time
i work for Anderson Smith running horses for you Rebs
you need any more proof
i did not say a word
i like listening
the longer you take to buy me the easier it will be to mess things up
Kelso checked your telegram
now he is checking on you
i am still listening
Listen quick
Smith told me all about you
Farraday's the name of someone you went to college with
you are Captain James Simmonds Georgia Volunteers
Your brother was killed at Bull Run
Your pitchman's Benjamin Guterman
more
no
you have got enough to hang Benjy and me three times over
here is to that no trouble trip through the Union lines
what part of home are you from
the only thing we have got in common is that we bleed if we are cut
i am in this for money
how much
2 000 gold
that is what Smith promised cash on the line
Benjy
Give him 300 in gold
2 000 is the price
300 now and 1 000 when we are inside the Confederate lines
you can not get through Indian territory without me
Maybe not but we can try
it is a deal
Number 22 black
Easy come easy go with our money
he hasn't won a hand
the faster he loses the quicker he will go
that won't be long
Aces a pair
he is got the manners of a pig
here comes Christopher Columbus and the sheriff
Gentlemen
what are you gonna sing
Give us a song
Gentlemen please
Sing nice and loud we will chime in
i have an announcement
in cooperation with the army from now on any vehicle leaving Baxter Springs will be searched
what are you looking for
when we find it you will know
that fixes it
we must move fast
can you handle things at the Curtis house
Leave it to me
i will keep an eye on Manning
Miss would you
do you have anything for stomach poisoning
it is very late
anything
Please
Please
Come in
i did not mean to turn you away
you are very kind
i am leaving early in the morning
i understand
never mind
Nonsense
you come right in
you sit down here
that is it
i will get something from the hospital room
we will pump your stomach and you will feel better
NO
that never helps a case like mine
do not be alarmed
it is practically painless
i do not mind the pain
two doctors tried the same thing
they did not get any place
Exactly the same thing
i have a special type stomach
Really
it is the way i am formed
do you get these attacks often
Four times a year
the only thing that helps is kummel tea
Kummel tea
it is a German special
it is an old remedy for stomachache
yeah
you sit quietly and i will brew some right away
where is your partner
in the saloon
the water'll be boiled in a moment
you look better
Being in a warm house always helps
does Mr Farraday know you are sick
when Jim gambles he doesn't like to be bothered
Fine friend
he is not so bad
he gambles to forget his troubles
what kind of troubles
one thing and another
i am not supposed to talk about it
that is it
Genuine kummel tea
my grandmother said good kummel tea will cure anything
i will show you how she used to make it
was he in trouble with police back East
Except when it comes to gambling and women Jim's law abiding
now if you will bring some cups please
Why can not you talk about it
about what
Mr Farraday's troubles
i gave my sacred word to him and his
i gave my word
one teaspoonful for flavouring
my grandmother may she rest in peace said one teaspoon
no more no less
it must be shameful if you were sworn to secrecy by him and his
who was it
i promised not to talk about that
you understand my position
Naturally
i can feel that kummel taking hold
can i boil up another batch
it can take a couple of pots to come back to myself
i could use another 300
we have a contract and that is that
1 000 more and we are through
i am ready when you are
Pretty soon now
i will let you know
i know who that other person is
a girl
i
i promised
Benjamin who took care of you when you were sick Mr Farraday or me
you did
Either we are friends or we are not friends
we are friends
then tell me
it won't go outside of this room
you have my word
Your sacred word
my sacred word
you were right
a girl
two
was it in Boston
and New York
where else
Chicago
and
Milwaukee
that is why Jim wants to leave here
Why
he says there are not enough girls here
Hey listen
do not
Give me the gun
no
what is wrong
it is all right
Just target practice
oh well

Unconscious
she is being put to bed
when is she leaving town
Very early tomorrow

Target practice
she could outshoot the Union army but she drinks like a Yankee
Passes out on one pot of Grandma's tea
Nora's taking these boxes for us but do not tell her
the hospital wagon why did not i think of that
you were too busy
she only got drunk because of you
my being a conscientious objector
Your reputation with women
Thanks friend

they are used to this wagon
they won't bother
and if they do
we shoot our way through
you and Manning pick it up at the ford
i will meet you there at daybreak
where will i find Manning
the livery stable
i do not like dealing with him
if he can run horses out he will be able to get us through
here you'd better hold on to the bankroll
no sense trusting him
Watch him
with Manning you shoot first and discuss the reasons later
yes

Breakfast

Keep your eyes on the trail
you are alive only because that squaw comes from Yellow Hawk's village
the squaw and the kid are your life insurance

the South must be proud of you
the trail's that way
Clean as a whistle

you coming back here Mr Farraday

OK
Thank you
Get up
we will be with Kelso if you need us

there is a message for him
i will give it to him
Sorry it is confidential
Come in
for you
some big news too
Richmond and Petersburg were evacuated
General Lee's army is in retreat
Say that is great news
do you
Research show James Farraday was a Union army major killed in action two years ago
Suggest your man assumed this identity for own purposes
Let's pick up Jim Farraday
Wait a minute
Farraday left town
how was i to know you wanted him
you never said anything
when did he go
oh four no five hours ago
you searched his wagon
yes
he said he was off to Lawrence
we will get him there
he is not going to Lawrence
can you track a wagon
yes but not at night
i want 12 men to go with us at dawn
i will have them
nothing much besides bottles
someone should take it back to Baxter Springs
Ross
next time it will be your face
the other wagon was here first
a single horse probably Farraday's took after the wagon
how long ago
can you tell
no but i can follow it
it is called a Gatling gun
Tell your men it fires 250 bullets a minute fast as rain from the sky
i have told them
now let the gun say that you have earned the price
Tell them to hang on to their war bonnets
Watch those
Look
one of your own rifle bullets
it fits this gun
this gun is worth ten tribes
they will all fear Yellow Hawk
Unless they too get such guns
they can not
Only four exist this is the only one in the West
we march against Fort Smith
Good hunting
Six more bag of gold 4 000 gold dollar if you march with us
it is not my war not for just 4 000
inside Fort Smith there is much more it is yours if you shoot the gun
how do you know what is inside
my scouts have seen it
with the fort's ammunition and this gun many tribes will join us
Even with a gun you need more men
we have friends in other villages Yogalan Taminiconju Hiosake
they will come when we call
if i join you it is for one attack only
i agree
and an escort out the territory when it is over
i agree
it is a deal
when do we march
Sunrise
Smoke signal over the ridge sir
Go to sleep now
no more crying
we will fight the war once we get out of here
where is Manning
Gone
this morning with the gun
they are going to attack Fort Smith
Come on come on
Just a minute
that way to Fort Smith
we are not going there
i will drop you off home then i am going home myself
but we have to warn them
i am not concerned about Fort Smith
but you are concerned about the gun and Brett Manning
i will catch up with him some time
that is one thing i am sure of
you won't consider a truce talk
not when you'd let the men at the fort die
nothing i can do
you can warn them
where i come from saving Yankees is not very noble
can not you think of them just as people
i could but it would not be easy
the same people burned my home and killed my brother
and you know if i made that noble gesture you keep harping on they'd shoot me for a spy
i guess you are right
in a war you have to take sides
and four years of war are more than enough to learn how to hate good and hard
you said that remember
there are not really many differences between us
some day when we know each other better
some day maybe
Time to turn in
Just like you Yankees you want all the territory for yourselves
Mason Dixon Line and see that you do not cross it
Get up
Slowly
Go on pick it up
the best kind of rebels are dead ones
Mr Kelso and i have the same philosophy but different viewpoints
where is that gun
he just searched me did not he
Manning sold it to Yellow Hawk
they are advancing on Fort Smith
if we hurry we may make it
Thomas alert the Lawrence garrison
the fort'll need help
you should send Miss Curtis back with them so she won't see the bloodshed
it will be like Atlanta when you brave Yankee soldiers burnt us out
the fort is not all Yankee soldiers
their families are with them
they have got some kind of rapid fire gun
i have heard about such a gun
it will wipe us out
we can not locate it
we need to send out a patrol
Send out 12 men
yes sir
Go up the tower
Report all activity to me
yes sir
the fort is just over that rise
that is the Gatling gun
Mr Kelso give me Mr Farraday's gun
Keep your men out of sight
Fort can not last much longer
i need one man with me
we have to knock out that gun
i am ready when you are
we will use knives if we reach Manning
if we stop him we stop the gun
he is probably the only one who can operate it
he may not be the only one
what about your leg
any of the men will take your place
i will be OK
we will go up on opposite flanks
the rocks protect the gun
Deploy the men behind that ridge
no noise we only have one chance
yes sir
Take cover
more of them
Colonel more smoke signals
two new tribes have joined Yellow Hawk
Maybe 1 000 maybe more
Colonel Stagg
Signals from Major Dawson
he is on Ridge Hill
Signal him to await orders
yes sir
no you can not shoot
no noise those were the orders
Signal Major Dawson to attack
i guess i can deliver it to the arsenal in Indianapolis now
where are you from Mr
James Simmons Georgia Volunteers
that train robbery was a nice job good timing
Sergeant let's move this gun inside the fort
Mr Kelso i hope you will take into consideration what Jim did
i never liked being judge orjury Miss Curtis
Richmond and Petersburg have fallen
Lee's army is in full retreat
it is a matter of days now
what happens to you will be up to the military court if you are around when they meet
Jim
do you have any plans
i will go home fix up the old place
Travel maybe west i guess
Anywhere near Baxter Springs
my first stop
that different point of view again
i plan to make it your last stop
next to last
you will like Atlantait was sort of a weird day
the wind was lightish and i was just kiting there
i cut over to the south tower and some stuff fell so i cut back the other way and i just saw a mass falling towards my kite and i thought it was the same thing
so i turned the kite back and then i looked over and before they hit i realized it was a person that had jumped
so then i cut over just to see or maybe possibly help
the current just sucked him under and i stayed in the tide because i knew that the Coast Guard would come
that is when it became more of a surreal experience to me because i have seen the Coast Guard boat a million times and they have helped us out and rescued us when we have problems but they are all wearing the white hazmat suits and that is when i realized that there was definitely a person and
i never knew the real scale of the problem
i do not know the whole thing is crazy to me
i mean i just do not even understand it really
when i was riding back after that time
i was thinking about how that person was at the lowest of the low of their life obviously
and how the whole day all i could think about
it is going to be a good day to go out and kite and pack my passion sport
and here at the same time you know
i am reaching you know for what i love to do
and this person is ending their life
so that was unreal
yeah exactly
Kiting is to me a real celebration of life
it is exhilarating
it is thrilling
it is just awesome
so it is a real juxtaposition of celebration of life and ending of life
it was one of those epic days in San Francisco driving across the Golden Gate Bridge
it was crystal clear the bay was calm there were tourists walking across the bridge
and usually on those types of days i always soak in the beauty of the bay and look over to Alcatraz
and on that particular day i looked over
i was probably a little bit more than mid span when i saw this gentleman on the railings
and at first glance i thought
Wow this guy looks like he is going to bungee jump
because of the way that he was standing on the railing and then common sense kicked in and said you can not
my thoughts were
you could not jump off the bridge
Bungee jump off the bridge
and then he just kind of held his arms out and disappeared
and i was not sure if i was imagining this
and so i drove for a few seconds and looked in my rearview mirror
and my heart rate went up and i almost felt like i wanted to start crying because i thought to myself Wow i might be one of the last people that have ever seen this person alive
when i went into the tower and i talked to the highway patrolman
i asked him blatantly i said
is this a rare occurrence or does this happen often
and he looked at me and kind of smiled and just said
it happens all the time
it is hard to define Gene as a person
he was just not of this world i think is really the truth of it
not of this world as we know it
his mother was a woman who said oh i never want children
and then a few years later she found herself pregnant and decided to have the child rather than leave the country for an alternative
and she was looking forward to it
and so came my friend Gene who was always referred to as my little brother Thump
he was born an old man
and all their lives it was just the two of them pretty much
People came and went in their lives as in relationships of various sorts
but it was mostly just always the two of them dependent on each other for that stability that one thinks of as
Tomorrow is coming and we will do this and we will do that
Growing up with Lisa in Marin she was just like completely normal until she was like 14
i am 4 years older and i moved away
i lived in Alaska
and my mom would write me and say
Hey Lisa's acting strange and doing these things
and i kept telling her it was typical teenage stuff and i came back 10 months later and there was a big change
our upbringing was was fabulous i would say until my father suddenly died when i was 14
Well that was a shock
that threw all three of us
but did not make Jeff and i mentally ill but Lisa had a different personality
she was not as outgoing as my brother or i
and she was just
she was more angelic
we went through all the counselors and finally got her to go to a psychiatrist
and he said
Lisa is a paranoid schizophrenic and she will never recover
that was a terrible thing to tell a mother
he says you have to take her right now to the Crisis Center at Marin General
she immediately when we got there got on the pay phone and started calling her friends and telling them how terrible i was to bring her to this place
Well they brought her into the Crisis Unit and you know for all the bad things she did when she was home she straightened up acted as if she was perfectly normal
and they discharged her
we went through that several times
she had her own style
she liked to wear headbands
she liked to wear black
Black leather headbands with rhinestones
and matching gloves with no fingers
and she always wore bicycle gloves
no Harley Rider gloves
you know leather
Leather
Leather gloves yes
she was a leather queen
i met Gene at a comic book convention in Oakland
we just hit it off immediately
by looking at us you would not think that we would become such tight friends but we did
you know he looked like the cool rocker type
you know long hair you know everything about him is you know just cool and the ladies like it and
and i was Mr Hip Hop
other side of the spectrum and stuff
everything was black
his clothes were black
his hair was black
the curtains were black
the walls were black
the sheets were black
he just wanted
it is as though he wanted no contrasts
he mostly just wanted to be in his room with his computer
me and Gene had long talks about love and where he is trying to find it
and i told him he is not going to find it on the Internet
a lot of times he did not want to hear it
he just wanted what he saw
he would send me pictures of these girls and i am like
Dude what are you doing
you know
that is not
that ain't it you know
i am like Take time get to know this person
you do not know this person from nothing
Just because you read a bio about this person and this person wants to turn around and have sex with you that is not love you know
i noticed early on that Lisa was very interested in romance
and i saw her go through some very painful rejections
she met a guy this was just before Christmas
she took off with him on a bus
she was gone for a week
we had no idea where she was
she was off her medication and i was wrapping gifts
all of a sudden i looked up and there was Lisa outside just really in a bad state
she thought our dogs were devils
and she broke a clock because she thought it was a time bomb
i had to have the police come out
but before they would admit her she had to have a court order to get in because she'd been in and out of the Crisis so many times
Being a schizophrenic is like watching TV and having 44 channels on at the same time
and that is her environment 24 7
you know there is just little noises here something there
and i am trying to talk here but that is distracting me that is distracting me and it is all equal
that would freak anybody out
she graduated from house to house to a home where there was constant care
and finally to independent living for about 15 years
that place was great
and she had her own room
she had a very nice situation there
she liked it there
but one of her roommates there right jumped off the bridge too
Well no
this was a friend
a friend
a friend of hers
two years ago
no it was longer than that
Longer than that
much longer
as far as pills and other forms of suicide
i haven't personally experienced that in my houses
it is like the last three people i think who i was kind of close to in Buckaloo were all bridge jumpers
after she settled in Marin
she did well there she was pretty stable
then all of a sudden this past year she just felt she needed more support for some reason
do you think that was the medication change
no i think it was because she was ill
oh because she was not feeling good
her teeth were just so rotted and they felt it was from medication and from drinking a lot of Coke
so she had to have all her teeth removed
so she looked kind of funny walking around with no teeth
that was a problem too
Just from then on downhill
the Golden Gate Bridge was designed by Joseph Strauss
it opened in 1937
each year about 9 million tourists come to visit
Well we went for Easter vacation to take out the kids to San Francisco
before going to the Alcatraz
before going to the Golden Bridge we went to Alcatraz and we went to the Pier 39 and from there we took a walk to the Golden Gate
we had a big dinner on
the week before Easter
Week before yeah Palm Sunday
so i said Lisa i am not going to fix a big dinner on Easter Sunday
the kids weren't going to be around
Except that was a tradition in our family to get together
but well she did not seem to mind
she never objected
so i called her about 1 00
she did not feel good that week
she still did not go to work
and so i said
Well i guess i could come down but i do not know what i can do
Lisa was so quiet and oftentimes had this
i do not know how you'd say it poker face
she kept her feelings to herself
she was not one to you know get all emotional
which surprised me because i look back now at Mira Woods
we were walking down the little trail and there was this huge redwood tree lying in the middle of the path
and she looked at it and she goes Wow look at that
and it sounds like no big deal but for Lisa that was like
that was different
and then she came home and i guess she was hungry and she asked a girl there
Did you fix dinner
and they said no
so then they said she was very quiet
she got in the freezer and took something out and fixed it herself
and after she had eaten
they said she was very quiet when she was eating
she got up and took her purse and her jacket and off she went
and that is the last they saw her
we were taking pictures of each other
and i was taking pictures to them
and Paulo was taking pictures to us and they were playing
and i got scared
he was holding the baby
and we were walking and
and we saw that lady
the lady just put the
the bag on the ground and she jumped off
i said she jumped
she jumped and i was like
and she told my brother to go call the cops
Well Paulo went running down to get some help because i wanted somebody to help her
because for us it was the first time to see somebody jump off the bridge
and before she jumped she looked at me and Vidarlan she was laughing
she laughed like a smile like you do not know what i am going to do
she smiled and jumped
she was acting like a gorilla or something
Ay
Sebastian
no that is not it
he likes to make things up
i am not 100 convinced that she did commit suicide
i do not know if someone had accompanied her to the Golden Gate Bridge and had encouraged her to jump
i do not know if someone had been pressuring her to go to the Golden Gate Bridge and jump
and certainly it is a highly risky rather glorious way to draw attention to oneself
my brother is very religious
he doesn't believe she committed suicide
he thinks it is something else
i do not know what he thinks
i did not know that
Well he won't call it that because it is a sin to commit suicide in his mind and that is not what she did
she fell or something
i do not know
he is coming up with different justifications so he can look at it
he doesn't talk to me like that
the thing is if you go stand on that bridge and look down the amount of guts that you have to have to stick anything over that rail
it must have been incredible the pressure on her
it had to be worse than the thought of doing that
and i have always thought of myself as the stronger person than her and there is no way i would have the guts to do that
Even with you know a parachute or something
and for her to just do it and just like that i was like
we still can not
i still can not believe it
my family my husband my kids we were like
how did she even think about doing that
i think it was a relief
a relief for her
because she knew that she probably never would be physically well again
and she knew she had the mental illness and she was just at the end of her rope
there were too many things
yeah i agree with that but it is
she is in a better place
that is all i can say
you have to look at it that way
you know
yeah i try and relive you know when doing some things if it is something Philip likes or my son would like this or
he still lives with me you know
i go somewhere a ball game or something he is there
i think i am getting more of an understanding of what he went through toward the end
because you feel the same way
it is just
what makes any of us go over that line
Well you know it is just
some days you think like that yourself
it is just he thought about it every day
yeah
what makes a person be able to do that
i do not know
i do not have the answer to that
it is like any pain and when it becomes unbearable you will do anything
and it is like physical cancer
i mean if you have cancer of the mind you know nobody knows what you are going through
i mean it was like our hands being tied
no matter how much we talked to him
i mean he was in and out of the hospital
the doctors talked to him and it was like nothing would change his mind
in fact i think the medicines made him worse
we thought you know if we can get him through his episodes
Well that is the crazy thing
as soon as you get somebody strong enough that is when they have the courage
so do you make them well or do you keep them sick
i mean
he tried it a few times but
the second attempt he said
my third attempt is not going to fail
he said i will make sure of it
he researched it and found the Golden Gate Bridge on the Internet
he said to him it was the best way
i mean it was planned out for months and the final 2 weeks he was making his you know last preparations
he said whether some people believed suicide's a sin or not
he asked that a lot
i said that is something man made up
at least he thanked me for telling him the truth you know it is just
you know i do not know
you know it is just i do not think God's going to hold you responsible for something you can not handle
and he said Well whether i come back or not
he says you know if i do i will see you again Dad
if not just know that i am at peace
what i am trying to say is that i did not want him to feel
like he was in a cage inside of himself
some people say the body's a temple but he thought his body was a prison
in his mind
he knew he was loved he knew he had everything can do anything and yet he felt trapped
and that was the only way he could get free
Gene was very overly dramatic
Even the simplest things were very long and drawn out and very hard and
he would always say things like Kill me now
You'd be talking about something and ask him
what do you want for breakfast
oh i do not care
Just kill me
okay well where do you want to go look for a job today
i do not care
it is not going to matter
Just kill me
yeah might be easier for you to just kill me
you did not take him serious if he said certain things because he would almost say it in a joking manner
he would not say it with like this intensity of you know like i am going to do it this time
and you know he was not that person
he would make light of it
he is like Man i am going to just commit suicide
i am going to just you know shoot myself
i am going to do it with a bow and arrow
and when he would say this stuff we were just like yeah whatever
and years and years and years would go by as he is crying wolf
but he was still fun to be around
i mean when i hear myself saying it it sounds like he was not fun
i mean he was fun to be around
he was fun to go out with and go to clubs with and stuff
he would just get in those little funks and pretty soon it was just like i did not even
i did not even pay it any attention
it was just something he said
all the time
in every conversation
if everyone onboard could take their seats as we go under the bridge
the swells and tides are very unpredictable
the Golden Gate Bridge is 1 2 miles long and the towers are 746 feet tall
the roadway is suspended 220 feet above the water at the center span
the Golden Gate Bridge is the most photographed man made structure in North America
and it is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World
we had gone to Montana Glacier National Park the year before and Philip had a blast there
we told him if he got out of the Army in time which he did that we were going back there
and they had those forest fires so we could not get in so i had been to San Francisco before and i said you will love it there
and the bridge fascinated him
for some reason yeah
when we were driving across the bridge he just kept like looking around and
i just thought it was kind of odd that he would just be
and he wanted to get out you know
he says can we walk along the bridge
i say i guess there are people who can walk along the bridge
yeah we were on a tour bus
yeah i say but we can not get out now
he just kept looking out the window like he wanted to get out and just look around and
you know he thought it was just so beautiful and when we did get out of the bus he wanted his picture taken a few times with the bridge in the background
He'd ask questions how deep do you think it is
how high do you think it is
i mean i liked the bridge too
i mean but
i mean he just seemed so fascinated by it and i just
Just thought that was kind of odd to have such a fascination with it
i do not know it was like almost calling him you know type thing it was like magnetic to him
yeah
i do not know
we thought he might go on to live out there
Even if he is homeless at least it is a city he loves
because he was homeless in Texas living out of his car
Met two girls online
Went down twice
those did not work
he always fell in love with the wrong person you know
i think everything just disillusioned him
he had this idealistic view of things and this perception of how everything should be
and then when it did not meet up to his expectations
after a while it was like what is the point then
but he still had to make a choice
Gene's choice his preference had been made years before
he became increasingly alienated and he had told his mother that he wanted to kill himself
and she in essence had told him
i did not invest a lifetime in you to have you die on me
Kill yourself and walk away
you do not have a right to do that while i am alive
and i think it was very hard for him to watch his mother's non participation in a battle with cancer that she might have won
it was a choice on her part
when i talked to him he was acting as if life goes on you know type of situation and you know and
I'd always tell him
i am here for you
you still got family no matter what
you know i am a brother from another mother
he said to me after she was gone and there was a lot of stuff to clean up
and he said Well now i can finally
now i can finally end it all
and i looked at him and i said Well you will promise me that you will not go without saying good bye
i remember coming home because Thursday night's garbage day and Friday's recycling day
and Philip even did that before he left
he took the recycling things out to the curb
i came home that Friday and
they were empty and i said
that is unusual for him not to bring the buckets back in
and when i came in the house and as soon as she said
where is Philip
is not he with you
and i was like he did it
i knew
and it is the hard part for me
i had a feeling it was going to be in San Francisco but i said
if he is in San Francisco and i call the police to stop him if i have time yet then he is going to just hang himself or have the policeman shoot him
and i said if he is that determined i have to let him go
but when she asked me i said no he is not coming home
from the death certificate he was already you know done
it was just waiting for the policeman to show up at the door
we just came around the corner after snapping the shot of San Francisco in the backdrop and he was right there
yeah sort of surprised him
yeah we startled him
we came up upon him
he was taking off his backpack
in hindsight he was probably getting ready to jump
then he put back his backpack on really quickly and acted nervous
and we interrupted him
we interrupted him from jumping
and you spoke with him because you noticed something odd
yeah his whole body language his whole energy was
it was just a bit off
he was definitely nervous and he had a shuffle in his shoulder and i initially you know picked up on that and said
are you okay
what is going on
and at that point he made brief eye contact
Well dressed guy
yeah
Brief eye contact too
he was very nervous
he would not look you in the eye for very long
he just kept darting away looking away
you know and his biggest concern when you asked him
are you all right he said it is a long way down to the water
no he said it is a long way down
Long way down right
i did not know how to quite take that when i heard him say that
and i did not know if i heard him correctly
i thought maybe he had meant it is a long way back to the other side of the bridge
and here i am thinking Well you are three quarters of the way
you are close
and of course that was not the case
and we did not see him jump
Did not see him jump
for me he said he was just going to go down so deep that even if he changed his mind he could not swim to the top
but the coroner said it was over instantly
Boy imagine what this looks like to people
they probably look at us and say
what kind of mother and father were they
yeah
i was not perfect
but i mean i do not think i was such a terrible mother
and then i remember Sharon said to me
you know it is not all about you
it has nothing to do with you
yeah
i mean i was raised in a family dysfunctional
yeah so was i
my father was alcoholic hers was alcoholic
they fought like cats and dogs you know
the abuse
i should be an alcoholic
i should be a serial killer
you think you are raising your family to be you know religious or whatever and you try and do the best but you wind up doing more things that are harmful
and then when you try and fix them you might be too late
and it is like well no matter what you do good or bad it is
you know things are going to happen
and he said if you and Mom who i love you know are having problems what hope is there for me
he says i think you know you loved me the most and tried your best
and he said if you are having problems you know there is no way i can make it
Took a lot of pictures while he was on the bridge
yeah
he wanted to show what he was seeing what he was feeling
i was taking pictures of Alcatraz at the time
and while i was taking the picture i saw out of the corner of my eye a girl walking by
and she climbed over the rail
and she did it so smoothly it was almost like she was going to a little
Like she had her own little clubhouse
i do not know like she was going to sit on the ledge to eat lunch
so i got a couple pictures of her climbing over
and then i started taking pictures of her standing on the ledge and i realized that this girl was about to jump
but when i was behind the camera it was almost like it was not real because i was looking through the lens
i was actually like
i guess i was waiting for her to jump because i thought there was nothing i could do
it was too late
Earlier i was actually staring down at the ledge in a couple different points on the bridge and i was just trying to think to myself what goes through people's minds whenever they are standing on that ledge and they are about to jump off
Like what is the last thing they are thinking of
or like are they thinking anything at all
they just had enough and they just go and that is it they are gone
i started yelling out to the girl you know asking her what was wrong
she seemed to be speaking in a different language
and basically like tuning me out
Like really not thinking about what i was saying
so i got up on the rail and i reached out and i really did not know i was going to be able to grab the back of her jacket but once i grabbed it
i just lifted her over the rail and got her down on the ground
she started to fight me a little bit
so i just sat on her chest and just called 911
and they were probably there within a couple minutes
as crazy as it sounds i think of myself
like a National Geographic photographer must feel
and he is behind the camera filming and there is a big tiger and it is running at him
and he is like this footage is so great
he forgets that in a couple seconds that tiger is going to be on top of him
but it is like you are in that camera you are just behind and you do not really think about what is going on
and that is where i had to separate or had to actually get out of that mode of thinking and actually act on it and do something to help her
after i left the bridge patrol i was going back to my vehicle and i happened to look over and it kind of looked like she turned back
and she looked right at me
and it freaked me out for a second
i just did not expect her to look back now
i do not know if she actually saw me and was thinking like you son of a bitch i wanted to jump
or whatever it was that she was thinking
i am sure that in some way she did want to be rescued because if she really wanted to commit suicide and just take that basically like ultimate shortcut to the next level that she would have just climbed over and just jumped right off
so i think that she was sort of crying out for help there a little bit
the police did tell me that she was involved in another incident on the bridge and they talked her out of it
and i just hope that she is doing okay
Gene had a lot riding on this relationship and he wanted to get out of California and he felt that it was going to be like a new beginning
and i think he had
he had it planned out in his head how it was going to happen
and then when he got there the reality was not quite the same as what was in his head
yeah i think he was chasing a certain magical wonderland that would make all his problems go away and making excuses as to why he could not find it here expecting to find it somewhere else
he just wanted to make it happen so bad
that is why he went to St Louis
Only love really love
Feeling like he was loved and in love was going to save him
and who is to say that this is not a genetic thing
who is to say that that was not the reason his mother chose to have this child because she too was depressed and knew that she could keep herself here and functional if she had a commitment
how do we know that it was not at some inner level that he perceived this very young and that it colored his needs to have someone depend on him
i do not know
the ideas of suicide if i am completely honest with myself have been there for a long long time
Years way before i was diagnosed
but i was just touching on it like you know oh i will just kill myself
but the real thought process of actually going to do it and commit the act started I'd say about'99
and that is when i cut my wrists
at the end of his junior year in high school he had huge mood swings
during his senior year they were just compelling
i mean he was constantly either very high or very low
that was really a fight
that is when Kevin was at his worst
there were times where he could not even speak
and there were times where he would not stop speaking
i was hallucinating and i had made the assumption that there were bugs in my bed
and they were like stuff that were giving me AlDS and stuff like that
and i was just completely off the wall
i hadn't been sexually active for years yet i thought i had AlDS
and it was like
it was all in my head
i sprayed my bed sheets with a disinfectant
like a deodorizer or something like that
but i sprayed my bed sheets you know i sleep in that
i inhaled it all night long which caused the hallucinations to become greater and greater
and so i got up out of my bed sat at my desk and i wrote about
i must have written 5 versions of my suicide letter until i realized These are mean
i can not write them like this
so i wrote a real nice one
or so my thought was nice
i mean it is a suicide letter you know
i guess it said something like
Mom you are not always right do not think you are but i love you
Dad stop being so mean
you are hurting people
he had a terrible episode
and there was no comment with regard to suicide
it was a commentary with regard to hearing voices and difficulty remaining under control
and i called his psychiatrist the Sunday night prior and had a conversation with him and the psychiatrist told me
no do not worry about it
everything is going to be fine
Kevin and i stayed up and we chatted about it
and he seemed to be fine almost completely calmed
our conversations go like this when he is mad at me
he tells me to sit down in my chair and he basically yells at me
so i
i told him that i do not want to
what did i say
i said i do not want to hurt anybody anymore
i have to go away
or something like that
and he said you have an obligation to stay here for your family
you have an obligation to me who is raised you given you everything you want
you have an obligation to live for your brother your sister
but he was mad the whole time
so i said all right i am not going to do anything Dad
do not worry
and he was like do i have to take you to the hospital Stuff like that
i was like no no no
it is all right it is all right
i said Let me just sleep on it and we will talk about it in the morning okay
i am really tired Dad
i am really tired
so uh
he woke me up the next morning about 7 00 so i got maybe like 2 hours of sleep
and he woke me up and he said
Hey you are coming to work with me
i was like no
he said no come on
i am worried about you
i am really worried about you
i said Dad i am fine
the entire time lying through my teeth because i knew i was going to go to the bridge and jump
i said Listen why do not i take the day off and we will go do something
and then he said Nope
I'd rather go to school
i kissed him good bye on the cheek and i was like
all right this is the last time i am ever going to kiss my dad good bye
i will never see him again
and he will never see me
and i went to my English class dropped all my other classes
i took the K out to the 28 to the 29 out to the bridge
and the whole time i was just bawling my eyes out
Just crying
Talking to myself on the bus
before i got on the 28 i had stopped at Walgreens and i bought my last meal
Starbursts and Skittles
and
Went out to the bridge
Found a place that i thought
all right not too close to the pillar
i won't hit the pillar
i will just hit the water
i will either drown or i will die on impact
or i will have a heart attack
so i got there
Stood there for like 40 minutes at that spot
Just crying my eyes out
Joggers bikers runners tourists whatever
Running by walking by looking at me
did not say anything
and it is not their part
it is not their problem but anyway
and this woman she came up to me and she said in a German accent
i think it was a German accent she said will you take my picture
i was like Your picture
Woman i am going to kill myself
what are you
what is wrong with you
can not you see the tears pouring down of my face
but she could not
she was on her own hype
so i took the camera took her picture
Said Miss have a nice day
Turned back to the traffic turned to the bay
and said Fuck it nobody cares
Pardon my French
and i hurled over the bridge
See what most people do apparently is they get on the ledge outside of the bridge and they stand there
and people can talk them out of it or pull them up or whatever
i did not want anybody to talk me out of it
i just wanted to die
so i hurdled over the railing with my hands and i was falling headfirst
and the second my hands left the bar or the railing
i said i do not want to die
i said what am i going to do
this is like
this is it i am dead
so i said Well maybe if i get feet first
Maybe maybe i will live
so i thought
all right it is worth a shot
so my head was falling like this and i pushed myself back somehow and i landed literally like i was sitting down
Kind of like maybe a little more elevated with the legs
and i hit with my feet
and i guess the water treaded through my boots a little bit so maybe helped the impact
and the boots are pretty tough so
and i went down about I'd say 50 40 40 or 50 feet
did not know which way was up or down
i am thinking Am i still alive
because it is like a 4 to 7 second fall
it is like 120 miles per hour
it is like
i think that is like 7 seconds below terminal velocity or like the velocity that the down slope skiers get you know
i was awake
i was alive
i was swimming my butt off to get somewhere where there was air
so i reached the surface i guess because i saw some sort of light
and i was screaming for help and i could not really scream my voice was gone
i could not
i could not yell
i was like Help
Help me
and i felt something brush by my leg
i was like oh great
i did not die jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge
a shark is going to eat me
i was like this is ridiculous
Years later i found out as a matter of fact last year i found out it was not a shark
it was a seal circling me and apparently it was the only thing keeping me afloat
and you cannot tell me that was not God because that is what i believe
and that is what i will believe until the day i die
i am sitting in my office and the secretary said
there is someone on the line for you from Marin General Hospital
so i picked up the phone and a woman said is this Pat Hines
and i said yes
she said Your son has just jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge
i have lived here all my life
i know what that means
and i said is he alive
and she said oh yes
and i thought that they probably told me that just to keep me calm so that i would not wreck my car driving over to see his mangled body
i shattered my T 12 and my L 1 which is my lower lumbar region into very very tiny little pieces and the pieces went into my organs
but they missed my heart
at this point in time i mean i still thought he would be dead
so i went up to this gurney and i looked down and he was wide awake
and he looked up at me and he said i am sorry
and then he just closed his eyes and
i just stood there staring at him and he was by that point in time in a coma
it was just super scary you know
i mean i can not
i can not explain it
to feel it would be like
Like feeling an alien jumping out of your body or something
Like your soul or whatever
it was ridiculous
Scary
Just really wild
2004 was a tough year for Kevin
it hasn't been a cakewalk
Kevin's been visited by extreme mental illness 3 times subsequent to his jump off the bridge
the most recent he was confined for almost 3 months while he struggled and his doctor's struggled to get his bipolar bracketed in
and it is a matter of diet
it is a matter of consistency
and it is a matter of proper drug therapy
Kevin will begin to make headway
his life will gain traction and then he begins to get outside of the brackets into which he can function
and unfortunately it has taken 3 times now outside in those outside areas to convince him prove to him more importantly that he can not go there
Unfortunately for Kevin it is get up at 8 00 in the morning take your pills at 8 00 have lunch at noon if you will dinner at 6 00 pills at 9 00 bed at 10 00
and that is a very very difficult existence for a 24 year old male in this society
but i have told him
it is a wonderful disease to have Kev because you can control it
if you had cancer you would not have the same opportunity
Unlike cancer Kevin as long as you stay within these bands you have got it
it doesn't have you
it is funny my family members still think i haven't learned my lesson
but the lesson was learned a long time ago
and you know
it is hard when you keep messing up and no one in your family believes in you anymore or trusts you
or they are scared you are going to go attempt again
and they are always worried
Walking on eggshells when they talk to you
it sucks
so i am tired of that
i just want them to say Hey Kev what is cracking man
Just be real about it
do not walk on eggshells around me
i am the same
i am the same guy
Just a different soul you know
Different ideals
i just want to be normal again
but i never will be
we started using crystal meth and you know
Using crystal just
everything started going down the toilet
she lost her job
i lost my job
we ended up becoming homeless
she has a little easier time letting go of drugs than i do
i have a very addictive personality
i just found out last week that she is been cheating on me again
so i picked up my son and i gave him a hug and a kiss and said good bye
and told her to F off
and then i found myself just walking toward the Golden Gate Bridge
i was crying the whole way you know
the only thing i kept saying was
you know
as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
i shall not fear a thing because God's with me
so when i got to the halfway point of the bridge i set my book down and i jumped over onto the railing
and i just sat there you know crying and thinking for a little bit
and the cops showed up
i made the mistake of letting them get to know me too well because they completely used my son against me
Actually i came to the bridge last year at this time to do the same thing
so it is not a new idea but kind of one that became a little obsessive i suppose
i literally got here
Today i was on an airplane from Houston Texas
what drew me to it in spite of having to do so much preparations is that it is so accessible
you just kind of hop over
yeah letting go that is the tough part
i do not know if people think about that a lot like the process that a person goes through in trying to decide how to end their life
it is like a search
it is like looking for a college to attend or something
you know the pros and cons and it is a destructive act but there is a lot of rational thought that goes into an act that a lot of people just consider irrational
in my bag i had my parents' phone number and i wanted them to know what happened and not just be agonizing over what happened to their daughter for a week or two
so i wanted people to see me actually do it
and i think i really did want somebody to say no do not do it
when Gene called me from St Louis in despair and was going to jump off the bridge there he said i am just calling to say good bye
it is time
what could i say to him
you know i had tried on occasion to find something that would encourage him to live
something
and i asked him again for a favor
i said Put my name and phone number in a plastic bag in your pocket so that when you are found i can be told
i need to know
he had called me from a bridge back there
but he called me first from the train tracks saying he was going to lay his neck across the train tracks
and because he said things like that all the time i did not call him back
yeah
because i just did not want to hear it
you know you can only hear the same thing so many times and give the same answer so many times
you know Stop being stupid
do not be ridiculous
it gets tiring after a while
you want to hear something different
so i guess when i did not call him back he went to the bridge
yeah he had made his way to a bridge
he called me on my cell phone
he told me this relationship that he was pursuing is all falling apart
so i kept him on the phone
and i was talking to him
at one point in our conversation he said oh a cop's driving by
and i actually heard the cop stop and ask him
Hey you are not going to jump are you
they asked him is everything okay
any problems
and he is like no not really
you know they decided to leave him alone
and that is when i said Look i am going to get a ticket for you for the bus and you are going to come back to California
and i convinced him to do that
David is very dramatic
Boisterous
a life of the party type
Playing the piano
Singing
you know really Mr Party
which is very interesting because i am not that way at all
and i think part of the reason he liked me was that i did not ask him to do that or he did not feel he had to do that around me
he was a handsome guy
he was a good dresser
and he just exuded this
which is another reason why i guess it is so shocking to me is that he just exuded this joy for life
Ruby was someone that i was always proud to pull in
so when there was somebody new in my life or i was dating somebody for a while I'd want to bring him over you know
one of Jim's favorite things was when he'd see me he'd say oh i met a new friend
you have got to meet this person
you have just got to meet this person
he had great delight in bringing people together
he really loved people in a
Just a very warm personality
at least that is how he was in the beginning
before 6 months ago i would never have said that i thought
Ruby had a significant depression problem
i know that he was alone without a source of income
i know his sister had killed herself
i know he had all those variables
nothing before this last few months of his life indicated to me that he was out of the range of the normal ups and downs that we just do not share all the time
David came over to Charlie's to have dinner with us
and that is when he told us for the first time he was seriously on medication
but up until that point
Apparently he had been self medicating with alcohol
and although i knew him for 9 years i could count on maybe
Maybe 2 times did i see him really drunk
David would every so often determine that he had to get his life back together or he would be confronted by me or other friends and start treatment
he took antidepressants for a month and a half or so and made a big show of it
but then in the end i arranged the labels so that i could see if he'd been picking the bottles up and he hadn't touched them
did not touch them for weeks
so a couple of months before he died
Ruby started talking about
he could not get over his feelings of losses and he thought that he might be depressed
but he did not have any health insurance
so he said i want some meds
got any ideas about how i can get some
and i had tried some antidepressant meds
they did not seem to help and i could not sleep on them
so i said okay listen
here
you can have mine
but you have got to call a physician for information on how to take them
you know i cannot be responsible for how you take them
but you can have them
so
i was going to give him the whole bottle of them
the original bottle and i thought
what if one day somebody goes into his apartment and is looking through his stuff and you know finds my name on a bottle of meds
i took them out and i put them in an envelope
Just a plain envelope
it was around November or the fall when Jim lost an enormous amount of money
and he actually made the statement Well if i do not sell these pots which were these Japanese ceramics
i am just going to have to commit hara kiri
when i called him i said David i know you are in trouble
i know you have lost your job and i want to help you
he stopped because I'd never really said that before
because i did not view him as really in trouble
and he said
i can not talk about this right now because i do not want to cry in the middle of the street
and i thought oh my God
you know this is serious
he is really emotionally on the verge of tears
5 months before he jumped he had written a note an e mail to a couple dozen of his friends saying that he had been contemplating suicide
and a lot of them wrote back to him and called him and
however he never mentioned suicide to me ever
and i just can not fathom the idea of committing suicide
and i just think i thought that he was one of those people who
for him it just was not an option but apparently it was
my daughter was leaving for camp and i said you know what
Let's go to the movies
we went into the theater
and he just
he just put his hands
his head in his hands and he just wept
he just wept in the movie
and i was tearing up a little too
but he was just crying and crying and crying
and
and he put his hand on my leg
and i said Ruby i do not need to be comforted
and he looked at me
and i thought oh my God
oh no
and i just
at that
you know it was then that i remembered that i put the meds in a plain white envelope a couple months earlier
so
we got out of the movie theater and we were walking to his car
and i thought
he is not just depressed
he wants to kill himself
and he said the meds i think i can not sleep because of the meds
and i said
i know
i wish i hadn't given them to you because i feel like i made it worse
they had the same effect on me
he said that is it actually
i can not sleep
and i am just up
i can not stop worrying
i just can not turn it off
and not sleeping is what is making me crazy
i am thinking about killing myself
and i said i know
you know i felt it when we were walking to the car
Like something was gone
and he said i am so ashamed to tell you that i am thinking about doing this
what would you think of me if i did
and i said Ruby i have understood that there are people who have incessant pain
but
i do not think you are one of them
do you have a plan
and he said Well i am thinking about different things
I'd overdose except i am not sure how much to take and i might wake up in an ER and that would be horrible
and i thought about the bridge
and i said you can not do the bridge
Too dramatic
he said what about people who shoot themselves
and i said it is too messy
it is not fair to your landlord
and anyway you know you are not in the category of people who get to kill themselves
and then he wanted to come over and spend some time and just did not want to go home yet
but i actually just
i wanted to be by myself
i said no
can not
but if you feel really desperate you call me i will drop anything
i did say that
so then i got him out of my car and went home
and i did not hear from him
Actually ever again
we all know how much all of us who have been close to Jim how his passing has affected us whether it is fear that you know you might get to that same place and do the same thing or just guilt because you felt you weren't a good enough friend
or whatever it is there there is a lot of different reactions
Talking to everybody there is a lot of different reactions
and i think everyone is trying to make sense of it and as one in Jim's particular passing which as a friend of mine said
he was warning you but he was not asking for help
i thought that he was probably feeling so ashamed because the theme of that night was
i am so ashamed i am telling you this that i made the mistake of giving him some space to recover
and that was a bad call i think
you know i could have 51 50'd him
but also i did not want to humiliate him and have him be in a psych facility because i was not sure they were really going to help him and i did not want to cross my boundaries
but i will never again not intrude
i won't respect their privacy
and their
and i will not ever again not do something because i am afraid that they might be embarrassed
there is obviously a fuzzy line between doing nothing and doing what would have prevented it
and who knows where that line is
he was a grownup
i could not tell him what to do with his life
and i suppose if we had him locked up or something then he might still be alive but
i do not blame myself like that
Initially several of his other friends went out there as a group because they knew the light pole number where he had jumped
i could not go
but a couple of months later i did go and it was very difficult
and i will never be able to sort of drive across bridge again without some kind of emotional reaction
something else i am pissed off at him about
such a great bridge
i think the bridge has a romance
a false you know a false promise
a false romantic promise to it
because he is dead
and he doesn't get to benefit from the romantic from the romanticism of it he doesn't have any benefit from it
it romanticizes him a bit in the legend
but he doesn't benefit from it
so what if his story has that at the end
he is gone
and so i think there is an empty promise
it is almost like when alcoholics talk about the romance of the bottle you know
Like maybe the first sip is really good and everything else is hell
so maybe walking out there he had a romantic moment or two or an hour
but hitting the water can not be fun
and so i think he felt like a failure and this was some sort of redemption
i think that it just drew him with this idea of you know sort of being famous
the last time i saw him i was leaving for work
i gave him 5 bucks so he could get a pack of smokes go grab a paper you know go out and maybe hit a couple of places to put in some applications
and that is when he disappeared
i was the last one to actually talk to him
and i remember while i was walking out the door the last thing i said was Cheer up Gene
i said everything will work out
you know and
Just jokingly i said
See you when i get home
Love you
that was it
that was the last thing i ever said to him
the last thing i ever said to him was a fight
yeah
because he was not
i did not think that he was trying to find a job as hard as he could
and it was making me angry because i knew that he was very smart and he was very capable
and the only thing holding him back was him just not caring
and he had found one of the kids' sidewalk chalk and he was sitting behind Matt's truck and he wrote End me on the ground
Like he scratched it in over and over and over
and my son came and got me
and said Why would Gene write that
Knowing Gene and the way his personality works and stuff the Golden Gate Bridge was perfect for him because it is just one easy step and there is no turning back
in hindsight i almost feel like it was meant to happen
Maybe he is happy now
you know who knows
i do not
i know i know he was
he could not have lasted much longer
not the way he was going
but if he would have waited there was a message on our answering machine from one of the places in Oakland that had offered him a management position which is what he wanted
they were opening a new
Game Stop
i think it was
yeah whatever
one of the game stores
and they were going to put him straight into management
and he had an interview the day that he jumped at 10 00 in the morning
and i do not know if he got the message or if he missed it because i do not know what time he left
he was gone before i got home
so if he would have been there to check the message or waited
i could not fully cry and i could not fully whatever but the overwhelming emotion was anger
you know i was extremely pissed
i wanted to drive out to the Bay Area and go to the coroner and you know get clear Wake up
Why did you do that
i do not see any reason for people to do that
and Gene had people in this world that loved him
and he hurt them
if i see him again that is what i want to tell him
he hurt me
and i did not think he would ever do that
Disturbed is an interesting word because it
that is all i can define it as as i was disturbed
now i miss him
now i am sad
but at the moment there was almost
that i got the news there was almost a sense of relief
that he was not going to be disappointed or unhappy anymore
i miss him
but i do not have any answers
Just a bunch of observations and a bunch of experience of feeling disturbed about that situation
i do not know why people kill themselves
and yet it is a small step to empathize
to say
because i think we all experience moments of despair that it would just be so much easier not to do this anymore
but for most of us the sun comes out and then
oh well tomorrow is another day
Why he chose the bridge
i do not know
Maybe there is a certain amount of release from pain by pain
Maybe he just wanted to fly one timePreviously on Boston Legal
do we have anybody in corporate who understands this credit card world
Somebody Hands
Sorry
Hands Espenson

Denise
Daniel Post C E O Christberg Pellham Incorporated
he has stage four metastasized lung cancer
never fun
a major pharmaceutical company was testing a new cancer drug
Post used his friendship with the C E O of that company to get himself put into the test group
and to make sure that he got the actual drug not the placebo
Hmm
the rich are different from you and me
Certainly from you
so
Post is being sued by another cancer patient who was in the same study and who ended up getting the placebo
what is the cause of action
what you'd expect
Conspiracy intentional infliction of emotional distress
we are going to court today
Today
i thought i could Sighs
handle it myself but uh
O Olivia died of cancer did not she
yes
at any rate
i am hoping you can second chair
you ready
uh Denise Bauer attorney
Daniel Post
Guy dying of cancer
is that the way he described me
Rich guy dying of cancer
Denise will be second chairing
i filled her in on the case
Actually you left out our defense
do we have one
Chuckles
i like her
i am not sure if thejury is going to like me Mr Post
i have a client who tried to buy his way into a cancer study
could you tell me what possessed you to do that
i got cancer
are you really my lawyer
or did the Make a Wish Foundation just finally come through
Knocking Door Opens
Alan do you have a minute
what can i do for you Jerry
they are meeting soon to vote on this year's partnerships
this will be my third time to be up for partner
my last time
i see
i was wondering if maybe you could tell me where i stand
you know the right people around here
and i know
Well no one
Jerry you are an extraordinary attorney
i am
i constructed a chart that reveals my involvement is typically the key variable in the firm's winning a case
Bingo
it was my research that was the determining factor in the Simmons versus Arrego Oil victory
not to mention 252 other cases
because of my research
Bingo
but still i wonder whether the senior partners are aware of my contributions
Jerry you know i have a tremendous affection for my own intelligence
and even i think you are smarter than me
oh i am
i will see what i can find out
how long have you worked for Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals Mr Clark
Eight years
and what was your position
i was a lab technician in oncological protocols
you worked on a drug to cure cancer
Trade name is Pneumitrox
it was specifically designed to hinder the rapid cellular mutations in the lungs
and did Devlin MacGregor conduct a double blind study to test Pneumitrox
Sort of
Why do you say sort of sir
the test was corrupted
Objection
Foundation
Overruled
on July 9 of this year you received a call from your supervisor
what did he want
he told me to ensure that Patient 1123 received the Pneumitrox and not the placebo
Why
he did not say
but i subsequently discovered that Patient 1123 is Mr Post
it seemed fairly obvious
Objection
Sustained
what made you come forward
Doing so has cost you yourjob correct
Sighs
it did
then why
because some things are more important than a job
Mr Clark how many patients were involved in the experiment
uh 2 000
and statistically speaking how would it change the likelihood of one person out of the 2 000 receiving the drug over the placebo if another person was directed to get the drug
not much
because there was no guarantee that any of the volunteers would receive the actual drug
the odds were originally 50 50
the odds would change minimally
instead of 50 50 the odds would change from 49 95 to 50 05
uh sounds right
so virtually no change at all
Scoffs
Well if you were dying Miss Bauer 05 is everything
Shirley i wanted to ask you aboutJerry Espenson
he is up for partner
i can not discuss that with you
Why not
Well that determination is for partners only and you are not a partner
i am sure you understand Alan
Absolutely
Jerry Espenson
you mean Hands
not a chance
he is a weirdo
he is not a weirdo
and he doesn't like to be called Hands
how could you not
the hands
a peccadillo to be sure
we all have them
i do not have any peccadilloes
what is your name Denny
Denny Crane
Ah
yes
my point is Jerry Espenson deserves to be made a partner
Beeping
what is that
Bev bought me a camera phone
the woman you enjoyed in the coatroom
we can send each other pictures
this damn thing takes forever to load
Things going well with Bev then
she said she wanted to fulfill every single one of my fantasies
i made a list
had to type it myself
my assistant threatened to quit
Denny you are glowing
she is an amazing woman Alan
it is like having a one night stand
but every night with the same woman
i am thrilled for you Denny
now aboutJerry
he is not a rainmaker Alan
Shirley says he is not bringing in enough money
he is toast
Weird toast
would you let me have a glance at his performance review then
it is highly confidential
Just do not tell anybody where you got it
oh picture's finally loaded
Look at this
she is very limber for a woman her age
Alan I'd like to be alone with my phone
Just 15 minutes
Poor people skills
Just hands it to you
not presentable
that is my Denny
not a team player
i can see why it is confidential
it is revolting and mean
you do not have all the facts Alan
Apparently i do
Apparently at this firm being white and male is not even enough
you also need to be a golden retriever with a pedigree to be considered for partner
i am telling you it is a wonder you slipped under the radar
with your vagina and all
Jerry's had a few blowups Alan
one in front of a client
yes
yes
it is on his permanent record back in 2000
it also says he made a couple of clients feel awkward
could that be perhaps because he is an awkward guy
it also says he doesn't play golf
Actually he doesn't kiss any ass whatsoever
he just does his job
and no one's denying that
but partners need to bring in clients
that is how we make our money
Partners need to attend social dinners and make public speaking engagements
and they need to do it without being
Different
Very dangerous Shirley
Very dangerous
you know how the obituaries always say things like
so and so died after a brave struggle with cancer
i am not brave
i am terrified
Cancer can make a coward out of anybody
so when you heard about the trials for this new drug
oh i leapt at it
i am not a fool
i knew it was a random chance I'd even get the drug and not the placebo
okay
i was willing to leave that to fate
he was not
Mr Hopper when you began the test did you stop taking chemo or any other treatments for your cancer
no
but there were other promising tests i did not enter because of Devlin MacGregor
i see
and did Devlin MacGregor guarantee that you would receive the actual drug
no they did not
is not it true that you have already sued Devlin MacGregor for this matter and received a sizable settlement
Objection
Relevance
i am going to allow it
yes
but i spent every penny on medical treatments
but the money is not the reason i am doing this
i am doing this because i feel
i have a moral obligation to stand up to people like Daniel Post
People like that with money and power they think they can get away with murder
and now he is murdering me
no further questions Your Honor
Judge
Court will resume tomorrow at 10 a m
Gavel Raps
Denise are you trying to make the jury hate our client
if so you are doing a goodjob
i am starting not to like me either
Mr Post i
Denise i am kidding
you are doing an excellent job
Sighs
i have a few questions
um are you free for a bite
um could not you just ask me now
Well yeah
but then it would not be a date
our client just asked me out to dinner
Well good
then you can use the time to convince him to settle
Jerry it is not looking like a lock
what is the problem
Generally it is poor people skills
you mean i am odd
does it say in my file i am odd
no
Alan i would appreciate candor here even should you deem it hurtful
According to your file you have occasioned clients to feel uncomfortable
some have even expressed reservations about being alone with you
Evidently you also once pushed opposing counsel over some dispute
Sighs
he made fun of me
as conditioned as i have become to ridicule sometimes
so i am out
it is not over
you know i deserve this more than Brad Chase
he cuts off a priest's fingers and i lose out because i push a bully
it is not right
it is not over
Jerry i give you my word i will do what i can
Shirley i am sorry
i did not hear you knock
Gee i i wonder why that could be
Maybe because you were too busy having sex on your desk
how did you know
i had the door closed
Ah
but you neglected to draw all the blinds
Gasps
Oversight
we were both facing the same way
i am all too horribly aware of which way you were facing
oh goodness me
i am so rude
i am Beverly Bridge
Shirley Schmidt
Did you finish the notes on the partnership candidates
i have been busy
the vote's tomorrow
Fifty of the most senior partners will be there
this is unprofessional Denny
you are setting a very bad example for the rest of the firm
Understood
and from now on in this office those blinds go down before anybody else does
she is jealous
Poor thing
hi Brad
Hey Jerry
how is it going
a little nervous about that partner thing
you
i can not say i am not
got any indication
not really
Paul seems to think it looks good
but i certainly did not help my chances by
Lewiston
he says it looks good for you
he could not make any promises
Did he mention how it looks for me
no
we did not really discuss you
do you ever
i beg your pardon
do people discuss me
do they talk about me being odd because of my behavior
Jerry everyone here knows you to be a fine lawyer
that is all i have ever heard discussed
it is in my file that i am violent because i pushed another lawyer once
how do you know what is in your file
i have a mole right here on my neck
Chuckles
it is not like me to make a joke
i hope it is in my file i am funny
that is a good social skill
Given the evidence a credible witness and documented proof that you were administered
the actual drug and not a placebo Question
Go
when do you see yourself liking me
uh Mr Post Daniel um plaintiff's attorney has been very effective in turning thejury against you
you come off as someone of privilege who has everything the jury wants but doesn't have
Except the girl
Bottom line it is in your best interest to settle
how about we negotiate a settlement
i am not following
i agree to settle the case if you agree to stop talking about it and and declare this an official date
Sighs
have you ever done anything nice for anybody
Ever
Humming
you are trying to get a look under the hood
Chuckles
not until you agree
Agreed
the answer's yes
but my mom taught me that it is impolite to brag about one's good works
then do not brag
Tell
what is to say
Mumbles
um my company sent thousands of pounds of supplies down to New Orleans before FEMA even put its pants on
i fund a charter school for learning disabled kids here in South Boston
i do not think the government does enough to help its people so i give as much as i can
do you know why i can do that
you are a rich guy who throws his weight around
it goes hand in hand
Money gives me connections
Connections let me do what i want get what i want
Sighs
you really do not care what anybody thinks do you
i got stage four lung cancer
i do not give a damn what anybody i do not know thinks about me
Life's too short
Really
Sighs
one more question
Why are you really settling
Did Mr Hopper's testimony get to you
it did
but do not get me wrong
i i
i would do it again
it was a chance
and so i took it
and uh as it turned out the Pneumitrox did not work as well as I'd imagined so
Given that i have less time than I'd hoped
i do not intend to waste that time fighting a lawsuit
so i will settle
now
more wine
you look distressed
Your Guns Ammo magazine late again
she hasn't called all day
Ah
Bev
it is nearly 4 00
she hasn't called the office
she hasn't called my cell phone
i checked the machine at home
9 15 9 30 9 45 okay
i sense a pattern
i have done something
i bought her a gift
i bought her a gift
Well in time i am sure she will forgive you
do not you see
i did not i did not give her money like i do most women
i did not have a personal shopper pick something out
i shopped
and i Denny Crane
i shopped
and i Denny Crane thought about what she would like
Sighs
Maybe i am having a stroke
Maybe it is the mad cow
Maybe you are in love
i am delirious with joy
Denny you enjoy being with Bev
she enjoys being with you
Why do not you just have fun in the moment
and leave it at that
i knew you would not understand you heartless bastard
Wow
he is got it bad
you should not eavesdrop
yes he does
Very
you wanted me to tell you when that partnership voting thing was
Starts in 20 minutes
and now we turn our attention to our next candidate Brad Chase
Excuse me
Sorry to interrupt
i have an urgent announcement to make regarding national security
i do not think our country is being run very well
that concludes the national security announcement
now on to other business
i am looking at a group of partners in a world class law firm each of whom owes some of their success toJerry Espenson
when any of you is stumped and you need someone who has an encyclopedic knowledge of the law and the creative spark to know how to apply it whose door do you knock on
Mr Shore we appreciate your input but you are not a partner
yes
but that is only because i can not be trusted
i have here the confidential report on Jerry Espenson known to some of you who should know better as Hands
this report while acknowledging thatJerry works very hard and has an astute legal mind also makes some veiled references to inappropriate behavior
but really this is about money is not it
and whetherJerry Espenson brings in enough
and do not we all just love our money
you people must realize that once the rainmakers have brought in the million dollar accounts those clients expect excellent representation for their money
and Jerry is a big part of what they are paying for
my God why is not being brilliant enough
Why can not a lawyer be a valuable asset to this firm without being a smiling Ken doll with an aggressive handshake
does everyone at the firm have to be this guy
Shirley
Mr Shore you have no standing at this meeting
we would like to ask you to leave please now
Jerry Espenson has given 15 years of his life to this firm
his work has been essential
how dare you invade the province of a private partnership meeting
i am sorry
i did not think an invitation was forthcoming
there is a lot you do not know about the business of running a law practice Alan
the first rule being it is a business
i understand that
but it is a service business
you do not peddle widgets
you do not push stocks
you sell your people
and as far as your people go i will takeJerry Espenson
do not give me Well you need to hear it
i said nothing when you fired Sally Heep whose only infraction was to sleep with me
i made not a peep when you deftly ushered Lori Colson out of the firm
i even understood when you fired Catherine Piper a woman i profoundly adore
i swallowed all of it because i know it is a business
but to abuse a talented selfless employee only because his social skills lack polish to allow him to work tirelessly under the delusion that he could make partner a delusion you nurtured so as to make piles of money off him in the short term
that is a betrayal Shirley not just ofJerry but of you and your character which up till now i have considered undeniably decent
are you finished
no
Jerry Espenson no doubt will go off quietly into the night as the meek often do
but somebody here has to get angry about it
otherwise you will just go off and blithely do it again
we have not yet made a decision concerning Jerry Espenson
when we do i will call you first to tell you it is none of your concern
there is a saying Shirley
Perhaps you have heard it
all it takes for evil to succeed is for good people to say'It's a business'
Door Closes
I'd been given a death sentence
you are the one person in this room that knows exactly what that is like
and there was this drug
and i thought it could help me
so i used all my power and my influence to make sure that i got it
but i did not think it through and i did not think that there might be consequences for other people
in this case for you
and i see now that i hurt you
and i am sorry
Denise
this is our offer
it is the only one we are going to make
and it expires when we walk out the door
this is a very generous offer
Just think about your family
i do not care
this could be very long and drawn out
that is exactly what it should be
what do you want
if i take your money it won't be hurting you
the only thing that will really hurt you now is if i take your time
and that is exactly what i am going to do
i need to talk to you
you will talk to me
no i won't
you have a wife
you have a family
you owe something to them
but you also owe something to yourself
i know this road
do not allow anger to consume the last days of your life
Bev
yes Denny Crane
would you like some money
Laughing
i i i do not
Bev i am afraid
of
myself of course
as godlike as i seem to you and other people there is a there is a a mortal inside this godlike shell
i do not trust myself
Bottom line
i am not a one woman man
you know Denny we are both much too old for this and too smart
we are
is there a powerful man out there who hasn't felt what you are feeling
no
Chuckles
so why fight it
i mean people do not change their stripes and you do not want me to change you
and i certainly do not want you to change me
therefore Denny Crane as long as we are together feel free to have sex with anyone else you want
Bev
i love you
Laughing
Brad it was a very close vote but you made it
you are now officially a full partner at Crane Poole Schmidt
Congratulations
Thank you Paul
i will not let you down
Brad
on your knees
what
Denny must we do this every single time
my name on the door the answer would be yes
on your knees
Brad Chase i hereby dub thee Brad Chase
Welcome partner
Thank you my lord
you wanted to see me Shirley
yes Jerry
Out of courtesy i will be brief
i am very sorry but you won't be making partner
but i have done everything i have been asked
Your work here is considerable
it is just not enough
not enough
i won't lead you on
there will be no further opportunities for partnership
however we certainly appreciate all your hard work and we welcome you to stay of counsel
the choice is yours
okay
Knocking
you free for dinner
because i got a private chef that makes a mean breakfast in bed
Chuckles
you see where i am going with this
a a friend of mine just made partner
so we are gonna celebrate
you know cake
Rain check
Sure sure okay
i got nothing but time
oh wait
you know that is not true
Mr Lewiston tried to impress upon me that i not consume the rest of my life with anger
the truth is anger can satisfy while despair is rather empty
you do not seem very satisfied
this is not simply about vengeance Mr Post
if you were the only one out there corrupting medical testing perhaps I'd take your money or if not your apology
but there are others like you
Maybe this will send a message
Maybe that will be the final legacy of my anger
Guy acts like he is the only one dying around here
Chuckles
about that dinner
not enough
not enough
where is my coffee mug
all
Surprise
oh no
Look at that
Laughs
not enough
it is not enough
it is not enough
my initials on the briefcase
Nice touch
Jerry
Why do not you come on in
have a piece of cake
here i will get it for you
no
i can do it
okay
how is that Shirley
is that enough
how about that
is that enough
is that
Look Hands i mean Jerry Screams
Everybody stand back
i will kill her
i swear i will kill her
i want to be made partner
i am gonna draw up an agreement
and you are gonna sign it Shirley
it will include a hold harmless clause for this assault
this is a crime
Hold harmless clauses are for insurance and real estate not for crime
do not say crime
we are just talking here
it certainly won't cover attempted murder
do not say murder
you substandard first year Go pull the criminal law treatise at 22 a L R 3rd 1228
Reference cases that hold extreme emotional conditions diminish one's responsibility for a crime
you
what do you think you are doing
Going to get one of your guns
no
Why would i do that
Muttering
the one day i do not wear my sock holster
you substandard partner
Get me Rosenberg versus Kaplan
273 Mass
411
the facts of the case can be construed to uphold an employment contract even though it is entered into under duress
you hot secretary that makes me nervous
Get me a copy of the firm's partnership agreement and prepare to make some changes
Shirley
Jerry this is never gonna work
Pipe down
do not stand
Go
Hoarsely
Get my guns
i am calling the police
which gun should i get
no guns Just look at the damn cases
Dictating
Subsection one upon his or her motion a named partner may unilaterally reconsider the rejection of a senior associate for partnership
Did you get all that
yes Jerry
Please type it up
Clackety clack
what is going on
Hands went nuts
i found the cases you wanted
they are excellent
Thank you
Jerry what are you doing
Taking matters into my own hands
that is right people
i said hands
See i can bejust as funny as you jokesters
Why are not you all laughing
do not do this Jerry please
Stop now before this gets too out ofhand
Control
i will help you
Like you did with the partnership
you do not want to throw away an entire life's worth of work over one emotional outburst
i do not want to see the most gifted legal mind
i have ever encountered rotting in a prison cell
now put down the knife Jerry
on one condition
you represent me once i am arrested
i can not
that is a conflict of interest
i do not care
you know the firm can waive that conflict
i know that you will honor that waiver because if nothing else you are a man of your word
Make the deal
i will represent you
now hand me the knife
Sighs
oh
everyone
this is the cake i want for my birthday
this is really good work
i assume it is clear to you now why we could not makeJerry partner
i have to be with my client
Well there is not much to tell really
we were married for 10 years and in love for well probably half that
it is probably hard loving a golf bum
Chuckles
you want to hear something really awful
Woman
Taxi
when we first got married i knew deep down that he would never amount to anything
and somehow i was okay with that
so what are your plans now
you um dating
Occasionally
Actually not at all
little problem with commitment huh
i know the feeling
i am um not looking for a long term relationship either
Chuckles
what i do not understand is how he got his hands from the cake to Shirley's neck so quickly
you know Denny i can not actually talk about this with you now thatJerry's my client
you are not really gonna represent him are you
i gave him my word
oh please
we are lawyers
he is a wack job
by the way did i tell you
Bev and i are getting married
no
i would've remembered that
yeah well
she is the one
yes
she seems like the one
Congratulations Denny
i want to assure you that my impending nuptials won't change anything between us
no impact whatsoever
Gasps
i gotta go
we are registering for flatware
Woman
you stinkerPreviously on Crossing Jordan
we have all night
more than that i hope
what happened
i do not remember
one shot could be accidental but two
this is Jordan we are talking about
there was the gun shot residue in her hand and her arm and her fingerprints were on the gun
i think that you would do anything for her
are we done here
yeah
i mean are we done
all four cases solid evidence of murder
all of the accused were acquitted so
Same judge presided over all four cases
Judge Clarence Gordon
so the son of a bitch drugged that drink murdered J D and framed me
Cheers
Cheers
who was it
some guy
Judge Gordon
Clarence Gordon ring a bell no
he is the bartender
the one Jordan thinks drugged her
yeah that is the guy
Plenty of prints though
Run them against Jordan's
not your case Detective
whose prints
Jordan's
Jordan can not really have gone round the bend can she
Lu's got all she needs Jordan's prints on this guy's throat
one day after she was holding a gun over Pollack's dead body
we all know Jordan did not kill anybody but we need to prove it quick before she gets herself in more trouble
Yeah'cause two murders and violating the terms of her bail is not bad enough
i want every piece of trace off this body and i want it yesterday
what if it is just more Jordan all over it
then that is what it is
you are a detective detect where Jordan is
all right
someone paid this guy to drug Jordan
if he told her who she is tracking him or she is in D C going after the judge that she thinks is behind all this or
she could be dead
i will get a warrant to track her cell phone
yeah but then you find her and Lu finds her
the Lieutenant has authorized me to put you on administrative leave
for what
Stealing evidence
you reported him Woody i need you to hand over your gun and your badge
i will see what the Lieutenant has to say
what do you think you are doing
Court orders are being signed as we speak
you will have nothing to do with this body
B P D will transport the body to the morgue
Officers are going to stand guard until an independent pathologist completes the autopsy
it is over
you are all done protecting her
Let's go
we need to find her now

i just spoke to the Lieutenant
Administrative leave formal hearing the results go to i a D
he took my badge
i thought we were done
and i am sorry
you can hate me
i get it
but we are talking about Jordan's life here
i am doing my job like you should have
she knows she was drugged
she confessed
Forensics back that up and then she comes up with the story
that is the way it always plays Woody Lu
you want to talk about this case
Fine
Tell me where she is
i do not know where she is
then we are done
this is a bad idea Nigel
Bad ideas are all we have left
we should be in the lab tracking Jordan's cell phone
i need to keep testing her blood to find
that could take a month
we want Lu to drop the charges we need to find evidence Jordan was drugged
now
are not we in enough trouble
we find trace of a drug on our bartender that matches something in Jordan's blood it will prove her story
Come on like i told you
they are rookies
Probably their first time in a morgue
how many days has this body been in the swamp
this area's restricted
yeah we just need to process that body
the next of kin are down there screaming
you can not be in here
Maggot infestation is worse than i thought
there is uh menthol and masks down the hall
Hey what do you think you are doing
Detective Simmons told you to secure the body until i arrived
which one's mine
Sorry ma'am we were just
Look Doctor
have you touched it
Doctor we um
have you touched my body
no
Good
Doctor did not catch the name
i did not throw it
and so we do not get off on the wrong foot
i am going to assume you really need to process this uh ninety year old farmer with Alzheimer's found in a swamp with a fishing pole and a history of heart disease
yeah you see well because the nephew stands to inherit the entire family fortune so the brother
is freaking out
the truth is that we should have waited for you
but we believe that this body contains evidence that can help clear
look could you at least do a color test maybe look for cadmium or hexavalent chromium
no
is there a problem
no
no problem
Good
then leave Doctor Switzer alone
she has a job to do
Thank you
i appreciate the support Doctor Macy
you do not have my support
you are here over my objections
then i appreciate the candor
and the privacy
Let's go
POLLACK'S APARTMENT
WASHlNGTON D C
DO NOT ENTER
Hey Lily
i could not stay home
i am so worried about Jordan
Look about last night
Well if it is not our very own runaway bride
Shut up Nigel
it is okay
Listen what you did last night was pretty brave
are you okay
uh besides the fact that Jeffrey's mom keeps leaving nasty messages on my cell
Man i picked a bad day to break up with Lu
Hey Lily nice wedding
i checked Jordan's haunts nada nothing on her credit cards either
any luck with the drug
Five hundred ninety seven and still counting
what
Well i have been trying to track Jordan's cell phone but her carrier upgraded to an anomaly based i D S with a screened subnet firewall
Nigel so this intrusion prevention system Nigel
it worked
PHONE TRACK JORDAN i am in
Finally
what if Jordan hasn't made any calls
the sim card sends a signal either way
she is in Anacostia
Southeast side of Washington D C
oh she is alive
and she went after the judge
Hey Nigel found her
Washington D C Wait
she is a fugitive
you are a cop
do you want to be an ex cop
i am working on that
i am serious Woody so am i
if we found her so will Lu
Once she gets a warrant for the cell phone
she will find nothing
our fugitive's sim card is no longer operational
i am still not going to leave her out there to go after this judge
or she ends up getting shot by some cop who thinks she is a killer
you are not going
who is going to stop me
i sabotaged this
i am sorry
it is not the first time i have had my heart broken
Probably won't be the last
See you around Cavanaugh
Jordan
Jordan it is me
Jordan
Jordan put the gun down
are they going to find out this killed the bartender
i needed protection
Your prints were on his throat
and he admitted to drugging me
he was paid to spike the drink and then someone shot him
Shot at me
Paid by whom
he did not have a name
so you decided it was the judge
you came to D C to make him pay
i need to know what is going on
to save myself
to find out what the hell happened to J D
you are coming home with me now and you are turning yourself in
i will help you find the truth the right way
not breaking into crime scenes to find evidence
i did not break in
i had J D' s key
which you stole from the morgue
Why do you have to do everything the hard way
no one else not Woody not me no one else can help you
Lu thinks i am guilty
Even you walked in here not knowing
Clearly i have some character issues if even people i know are so willing to see me as a killer
Jordan Look the police did not trash this place
i am guessing it was the person who murdered J D
they came here for him they tracked him back to Boston
Did you find anything
no
Pollack must have had evidence against the judge for taking bribes
that is why the place was tossed
okay if you came up empty how are we going to prove it
we go after the judge
FEDERAL COURTHOUSE

uh okay
you go
i will call nine one one
Sir sir
are you okay
i can not seem to catch my breath
DR KATE SWlTZER
NOW PLAYlNG WHlPLASH METALLlCA KlLL'EM ALL
this autopsy room is off limits
uh Doctor Macy said he left some files so
Late at night all systems go you have come to see the show 
Metallica
i would have pegged her for Celine Dion
is not this pencam fabulous
two point four gigabytes wireless sync audio capture
Nigel E centric bullet wound entering the right plural cavity through the sixth intercostals space
Hey nice job dropping that pen
what if we get caught
we clear Jordan and i do not care
Hoyt she is doing bullet probes before she does the autopsy
she must think she is good
the trajectory is front to back right to left and downward at a fifteen degree
she is good
okay thanks
C S U processed the alley
no matches in CODlS or AFlS no evidence leading to any suspect other than Jordan
that is because the shooter was not in the alley
Thanks to Cruella De Vil we can place him exactly across the street
so whatever we find right here we compare to the trace that C S U found in Jordan's hotel room
if something's unique to both places it means that someone
was in both places
the killer
Let's go
Nice music uh oh
Doctor Switzer
do you want something
i am in the zone
i would like autopsy results today
everyone wants everything today
yes but my suspect has been spotted in D C and the D a wants to know if we are talking multiple homicides
they have got her no they have just spotted her
they do not have her yet
Get Macy on the phone
USER NAME
PASSWORD
Go ahead
Call security
you tell them about me i will tell them about you
about the bribes
i can call the cops right now with everything i know
you do not know
i know
the cases you threw in Boston
you had J D Pollack killed just to cover up the fact that you could be bought
the reporter's dead
of course he is dead
you had him killed
and Lance Cooke
you tried to kill me too
no do not lie to me
i am not lying
Please what do you want
i did not kill him
okay if you did not have him killed then who did
i can pay you
how much do you want
two men are dead and you are offering me money
Tell me who killed J D Pollack
i will pay you anything you want
Just do not let this get out
you son of a bitch
Tell me who killed him
you can not go in
Jordan
Garret no
no
you are coming now
you are done
Let's go
Garret i had him
i was this close
you were this close to being in custody
that place was crawling with cops
Lily called
they were coming for you
the judge knows what is going on
i know he does okay
and you were about to get a confession weren't you
i need to get back there
no i need to find out Come on
oh my God
Come on
what are you doing here
Getting a snack
or tampering with some more evidence
how could i
you and Switzer send everything from the bartender's murder to the C S U crime lab
what are you doing here Woody
i am staying with my friends
because we are worried about Jordan
that is what friends do when they are worried
Doctor Switzer's autopsy report on Lance Cooke
nothing suggests anybody but your friend
the police might have missed her today at the courthouse but they are going to find her
Tell her that
Did you find something
i finished downloading the judge's laptop
in the deleted cache there are e mails confirming deposits to an account in the Caymans
the four case files Pollack stole from the morgue
Big payouts on day one of each trial another payout on the day of the acquittal
half dozen more cases as well
that just tells us what we know
the judge was corrupt
Only there is a last deposit eight days ago
that is the day Judge Gordon started his current trial
Ten times the amount three quarters of a million dollars
what is the case
that is the weird thing
a car accident that got elevated to vehicular manslaughter because the driver left the scene
Guy would probably do less than two years
what is the big deal
Pollack must have answered that question
Woody can you access the D C police files
um not exactly
uh i have been placed on leave
i could always try and hack in
no
i can get us into the D C morgue
Police files may be off limits but maybe we can access the car accident victim's autopsy
WASHlNGTON D C MORGUE okay we got the accident report personal effects tissue samples
James put them right here
the chief must have really owed you
Hell of a pathologist lousy poker player
Went all in on a pair of nines
i have the info on the car accident victim
his name is Dwayne McKenzie from a coal town in West Virginia
LOCAL MAN KlLLED IN HlT AND RUN
no survived by in the obit
Lost his mom when he was a baby
lost his dad two years ago to black lung
everything here looks thorough
Just an accident
could not be
LOCAL MAN KlLLED IN HlT AND RUN
so why does someone want Dwayne McKenzie run off this road
Pollack was killed to stop the article about the judge
the bartender was killed so he would not tell Jordan who the killer was
Dwayne McKenzie must have known something must have seen something
he is a West Virginia coal miner
how can he be connected to these people
we figure that out we find his killer Pollack's killer
we have got to get Jordan out of this mess
how long before Lu finds her in D C
she is out for blood yours Jordan's
we got to get out ahead of her
all right a lot of dollar signs up here
our killer had money to pay off the judge
yeah but why Dwayne McKenzie
there is no criminal record no family no enemies
Coal is energy energy is money lots of money
TERRA COAL DWAYNE MCKENZlE
Terracoal
Dwayne worked for Terracoal
Terracoal as in Terracoal mine disaster
i am thinking we are on our way to a motive
Multibillion dollar company paying off a judge would be pocket change
what would Dwayne have known that would have made Terracoal want him dead
it has to have something to do with that mine disaster
something dangerous
something Terracoal wanted covered up
Take a look at the footage that Nigel found
the close knit mining town of Corbett is reeling today from a tragic cave in that claimed the lives of several men
it happened this morning
i remember this
Right after the Sago mine disaster
but worse
Nineteen miners died when the walls caved in
Dwayne had the day off came back to help rescue his friends
the tunnel was completely cut off
by the time we uh got to them
i just wish i could have uh
on behalf of Terracoal TED HAWTHORNE OPERATlONS MANAGER TERRACOAL
I'd like to thank all the brave men and women who risked their lives to save their fallen colleagues
our hearts go out to all the families
Dwayne died twenty nine days later in D C where Terracoal's head office just happens to be located
what do you do here anyway
Excuse me
are you Doctor Macy's secretary
no i am the grief counselor
i thought she was on her honeymoon
Well she is not
may i
i just started it but
where is Doctor Macy by the way
i have no idea
and if you are not his secretary what were you doing getting his files for him yesterday
he asked me to
Well you left this
everything okay
no no no
Deleting files
what did you do
it is all the evidence from the alley
i just started to process it
Guys what is going on
Make it stop
Make it stop i can not
Looks like you have a virus
what is going on Nigel
we will call you back
next time you are stealing confidential information on a case you have been barred from and leaking it to your fugitive friend and a W O L boss use a firewall
Doctor
or next time do not do it
since you have just violated a court order not to mention breaking several laws you hacked into my computer you videotaped me without my knowledge or consent
we are going to get fired
we are going to go to jail
Come here
Just do what you have to
she is not coming in
Trust me
Get the trace off the bartender's body
she cleaned him
the trace is gone
it all went to the crime lab
then what is this
the trace from the bartender
she must have taken duplicate samples
there is got to be something here that proves Dwayne McKenzie was murdered
Nigel's still not answering
what the hell happened
he will handle it
this is weird the lungs were heavy over seven hundred grams each
Typical for a coal miner in his sixties not for one Dwayne's age
something was wrong with that mine
you got anything
i Googled everyone in his address book no link to D C no link to Terracoal's corporate offices
and his cell is broken
of course
Call log might have given us a lead
but
but what
Date an investigative reporter you pick up a few things
Let's see
uh okay everything i need to set up an online account
View his calls
Take a look at this lung tissue
Polyurethane foam
Foam
they used it to seal off mine tunnels
it is not safe but it is a hell of a lot cheaper than concrete
the government outlawed it when they realized it would collapse in an explosion
but after the explosion particles would be in the air
Dwayne could have inhaled them when he went in and rescued his friends
SAFETY COMMlSSlON HOLDS TERRACOAL BLAMELESS which damaged his lungs
that is why he was in D C Terracoal corporate offices
he was going to confront them and they paid someone to run him off the road
before he had a chance to prove Terracoal's negligence
no not negligence
Terracoal knew
that cave in was murder
and Dwayne was the smoking gun
Well you told them to stay away from this case and they are
i do not think i will do well in prison
Well for starters they hacked into my computer and they
you are just getting fired
i am the one going to prison
can you re process the trace from the alley
before we are drawn and quartered
i doubt it
there is no mention of foam blocks in any of these reports
the cave in was ruled an accident by the Safety Commission
now the Deputy Director of the Safety Commission is a former C E O of Terracoal
it is a conspiracy that Pollack stumbled onto while he was investigating the judge
his story would have exposed it all destroyed Terracoal
we do not have any proof Dwayne's accident was murder
Says here there were witness statements
Maybe the chief can get them for us
you want proof
i want the guy that Dwayne met with
Garret look at this
Dwayne McKenzie's cell phone records
D C area code
Tried the number four times
last one was the day he was killed
you have reached the office of Ted Hawthorne at Terracoal
it is the guy from that video
the Director of Operations
that means he ran the mine
he authorized the foam
he killed those men and Terracoal helped him cover it up
Switzer's trace from Lance
i thought Lu picked it all up with autopsy results
Switzer double swabbed
Wow
she is meticulous
Let us just hope that whatever drug he gave to Jordan was still on him somewhere
Compare these swabs with her blood if something matches then it is proof that she was drugged
NEGATlVE
how much time do you think we got
RESULTS
NEGATlVE
RESULTS
POSlTIVE
it is a match
yes
you did it
yeah i did
what was she drugged with
no this just proves that whatever was on Lance was also in her blood
i need to analyze the swab to figure out exactly what the drug is
but it is something right
oh you with me
you figure it out
Hey Lu we were just
i do not want to hear it
you are under arrest both of you
Obstruction of justice tampering with evidence
since when is the truth tampering
Truth
an independent M E performed the autopsy
i am not about to listen to evidence that you have gathered illegally that will only taint this case
Jordan would never hurt anyone
but she did
you saw the surveillance tape
she and Pollack were fighting they went back to the room and continued the fight
she picked up his gun and she fired
first one was a warning
are you crazy
or she missed
i should have stayed away
the second one she shot him
Dead
she shot him in the back
People do crazy things when they are in love
you are wrong
Jordan was drugged
we know that now
she was probably unconscious
Even if she was drugged you do not know what it did to her
for all we know it could have made her violent
no
it goes to the conspiracy
someone wanted Pollack dead
he was on a story about a judge being paid to cover up a murder
the murder of a man who was going to expose the fact that a major coal company caused the death of nineteen of their men
you are kidding right
you sure Pollack hadn't figured out who killed J F K
Pollack's D C apartment was trashed
his expose would have destroyed the company
they had to find out what he knew and stop that article
Period
you do not intimidate me
the shooter confronted Pollack in the hotel room
Pollack would not drop the article so the guy shot him
Only she fired the gun
Gunshot residue
uh uh
he set her up
he put the gun in Jordan's hand and pulled the trigger
Reporter killed might have set off alarms
someone would look into what he was working on
but a guy killed in a lovers' quarrel
Only it did not happen that way
the drug in Jordan's system was a derivative of Flunitrazepam
it is like a roofie it starts taking effect less than an hour after ingestion
we know she took the drink around eleven thirty and they were back in the room by quarter after twelve
that still gives her time to shoot Pollack
before knocking you unconscious this drug has one unpleasant side effect
Invariably you throw up
yeah but if Jordan had tossed her cookies anywhere in that bed we would have found trace and we did not
i am betting that is because she was not there
can not hold your liquor like you used to huh Cavanaugh
there
i will get you some water
yeah
Mm hmm
Thought you'd turn up sooner or later
Stop the story
you do not intimidate me
Your kind never does your own dirty work
i am telling you do not write
Piss off before i call the cops
How'd she end up on the bed
C S U put the shooter's spot in the bedroom
no blood trail in here so they only did a grid search
okay Bitumen vitrinite
crystalline silica
must have come off the killer's shoes when he bent down to pick up Jordan
what is that
Coal
as in Terracoal
you going to throw us all in jail or let us nail these bastards
Vitrinite and crystalline silica in the exact spot Lance's killer stood
Laced with Sodium Chloride Methylphenol and urea sweat
which means we could get D N a
it still doesn't give us a suspect unless we have someone to match it to
we do
not to state the bleeding obvious but coal mining is extremely hazardous which is why every major coal company has a D N a database of every employee
anyone who goes into that mine
to identify bodies in a disaster
this this is our killer
i think i might have persuaded the D a to get us a search warrant for Hawthorne
Jordan
Jordan
TERRACOAL HEADQUARTERS WASHlNGTON D C
TED HAWTHORNE OPERATlONS MANAGER TERRACOAL
Ted Hawthorne
can i help you
you cut a few corners to save a little money and it cost nineteen men their lives
not to mention the three men you had killed to keep it all quiet
i just want to hear you say it
i need security in the parking
you do not understand the pressure
the accident was on my head
my bosses helped cover it up but once Dwayne threatened to come forward they asked me to do whatever was necessary
i have a wife and kids
i could not go to jail
what do you want
i want to kill you
Put your hands where i can see them
what the hell are you doing
you have the right to remain silent
got to do it your own way
the guys found coal residue which led to D N a evidence
Put Hawthorne at both crime scenes
Hawthorne killed them himself
Cleaning up his own mess
Come here
Garret it is okay
Just go with it
Doctor Cavanaugh you are going to have to come with us
in all my years on the force i have never seen such unprofessional behavior

now get out of my office
you wanted to see me sir
Hey hey what happened in there
i was supposed to meet with i a D
you are off the hook for everything
Why
Why
i recanted
i told them that i found the evidence that i misplaced it
you did that for me
i did it because i was wrong about Jordan
all charges have been dropped
If i had the chance love I would not hesitate  Tell you all the things i never said before Don't tell me it is too late Because i have my illusions to keep me warm at night I denied my capacity to love
you look pretty good for a girl who just got out of the slammer
Thank you for sticking your neck out Been up all night drinking to drown my sorrow down Nothing seems to help me since you went away I'm so tired of this town Well every tongue is wagging
Doctor Switzer what are you doing here
the case is closed
Actually i have been asked to stay
Telling secrets that should never be revealed Nothing to be gained from this but disaster
here is a good one Did you hear about my friend He's embarrassed to be seen now 'cause we all know he's sick
If i had a chance now you know i would not hesitate I denied my capacity to love and i am willing to give up this fight Oh i am willing to give up this fightthe tests showed that you have a condition known as athrial fibrillation
it is serious
it can also lead to heart failure
i do not think you should tell our kids right now
okay
yeah
i am in this relationship with a guy who is younger and i was wondering about having another baby
yes biologically it is possible
Did you give me this job because you thought
i would be good at it or because you want to sleep with me
you are smart and you think for yourself that is why i gave you the job
and it is why i kissed you
Hey
Hey
i leave you alone for five seconds you are shredding important documents again
it is like Watergate in here

it is just so weird
Ah well i mean it is it is weird
yeah well that is what i thought later
it is weird because he has no idea how close we have gotten
Right
how fast things have gone and now of course he doesn't understand where we are
no i mean it is sort of been my fault
i have tried to keep my distance from him especially after the whole photograph incident
Just like try not to embarrass him
but maybe that was a mistake maybe maybe now i should just take him out and say
hey man i am not going anywhere neither are you so let's talk it out
do you start all your best talks with hey man
yeah that is the key
they are like whoa this guy speaks my language
you are like the teenager whisperer
i am
i can not even believe you are
hey man
oh wow
and they just calm down immediately
Whoa this guy this guy's hip
would you take him out for a burger or something
yeah
yeah i think that is a good idea
i think
i want him to feel like we are all a family
and we are
oh my God it is used for aneurysms and blood clots
i wonder if he had like a heart attack and did not tell us
or he just hasn't had time to talk to you about why he is taking it
Well i think you'd find the time to tell everyone you have had a heart attack
you do not know that he is had a heart attack
it is just he could be taking it for something completely minor like
no i bet it is this
antiphospholipid syndrome
Thane's an auto immune disease
that could be worse than a heart attack
okay you know what this is the worst thing
they say you should never Google your symptoms
Wikipedia bad
all right
to relax
it was a lot of pills
i think it is going to be okay
Drew
oh hey
you want a ride
oh no i am fine the bus stops like right there so
well i mean i am going to the same place
yeah i mean
Come on
yeah sure
all right
all right
here we go
so how was school today
it was fine
i know uh Mrs Griscom really likes to pile on the homework this time of year so
yeah she really big pile of work
Well i was thinking maybe we could uh you know go out and get a burger sometime you know
Just like a casual thing just get to know each other
yeah yeah i feel like my mom told you specifically to ask me to get a burger
no no no i she your mom did not put me up to this
this is something i wanted to do just to sort of
Get to know you better you know
i barely
yeah i guess
i mean sure
some burgers some milkshakes
Just two dudes eating burgers hanging out
yeah pretty classic scenario
Well cool all right
Cool
okay here is the surprise
my friend at my old firm called me and she needs a new paralegal
and i told her about you
i really have no idea what that
i do not know what a paralegal does
i do not even
i do not know anything about the law
i know but you are a smart girl trust me
you are smarter than most of the paralegals i work with
you can pick it up quick
but did not they like go to school and they are all going to apply for this job
i have no experience
i mean i know how to make coffee
okay i have a little bit of pull
what do you have connections
she is my friend i talked to her about you and how special you are
Pretty gangster of you
so if you are interested she needs the application by 6 00
i know you can do this
i do not even know what this means
Salary requirements
oh you can leave that blank
Actually the salary is set at 48
48 what
48 grand
Holy balls are you serious
for no know how of how to do this job
you can learn on the job like i said
Zoe i know you can do this
Hey goose
Hey mom
is this a laundry visit or a food visit
Hey i come over here all the time when i do not need anything
i resent that
oh it is too bad because there is a cheesecake in the fridge
um i was actually hoping to talk to dad
is he around
Just give him a good shake
he will wake up
you know what i am going to let him rest
uh it is probably better if i talk to you anyways
oh yeah what is up
Well i went to pick up my allergy medication at the pharmacy and they gave me a bunch of dad's pills by accident
Warfarin
i googled that
it is a very serious medication
Your dad doesn't want you to worry
and really there is nothing to worry about
it is preventative more than anything
Well but for what what happened
Look goose I'd really like to talk to you about this but dad was very specific about my not discussing his health with you kids
you know how private he is
he is on an erectile dysfunction commercial
i do not think he can claim privacy as his number one priority any more
Mom you can tell me what is going on
i am not 13 years old
i mean if i need to be worried then tell me i need to be worried and i will start helping
it is just that your dad
Wants to appear strong to you kids
it is important to him
Mm hmm
and if there is anything that turns out to be you know worrisome i will let you know
Look Max we are just trying to understand why you do not want to play basketball's your favorite sport you love playing with Alex
i do not like it the way they play it
there are too many kids on the team
Well it is certainly different when everybody's out there on the court but that can also make it really fun too
that is how you learn teamwork working together
you know Micah probably has more fun because he gets to play video games during basketball
Well you get to play plenty of video games
but he has this one where you are like a knight and
we are talking about basketball
you go around slaying dragons
we are not talking about we are talking about basketball right now
you get to play plenty of video games okay
Well you know what i can not play
' cause i have a disability
okay do not use that as an excuse
Max having asperger's makes certain things challenging but we know for a fact you have got a great lay up so
well yeah i know i have a good lay up and i tell the other kids that but they still do not pass me the ball
oh
okay look
my P E Teacher says that if you write her a note she will let me skip
it is problem solved
Well Max we do not want you to sit out
we want you to feel included and
you can play basketball Max you can
but it is the easiest solution
it is not
Look if i am so good at basketball then
then why do i always get picked last
i do not know pal
Alright Max remember basketball is all about working together so i want you to try and pass the ball two times before you take a shot okay
Did you do anything this morning to limber up
yeah i limbered up
What'd you do
Took a shower
no that doesn't count as limbering up dad
it does at my age i will tell you
Just pass that ball all right
Remember if your teammate makes a basket say
good shot if they miss nice try

but i am trying to set her up for that point instead of just throwing her to the wolves when
well honey it comes to a point where i mean she is going to have to make her own decisions
Maybe she doesn't want to feel indebted to us
i mean especially if she is changing her mind about the baby that is that would make more sense
Honey you cat do that
you can not go down this road every single time
Zoe changes her mind okay
and you just have to be prepared for whatever decision she makes
no you can not put that there
you will miss the zombie
oh okay
i am not supposed to tell other people when they are doing something wrong
i am very sorry Micah
it is okay
i was going to miss the zombie
do you want to try mine
Even though it is my favorite game in the whole world
here let's trade
okay press down and then a if you want to start a new game
okay press start and then a if you want
yeah yeah i have played it before
 so much love the kids are laughing 
i should probably try and say something funny now but i am not really sure how to do that
it is okay
i do not like to joke that much
me either
i have always been kind of a serious kid
i like being serious too
Cool
Cool
 every little girl and boy   even better when they wake up   tomorrow it is been such an honor to talk and to meet so many of you all this evening
Small business is the heart and soul of our economy

Thanks so much
Bob
Fuentes
Mr Fuentes

Wait what are you going to talk about
me
you are going to talk about me

 and then we see  these moments are the only gifts we need 
oh sit sit sit
no i got it
Pop this stuff in the fridge
so uh
i meant to say thanks for recommending me for that job but i decided not to take it
yeah
yeah
Why not
Just was not for me you know
besides i do not really think it is my thing to wear nylons every day
Right
not my style you know
but i just
i do not want you to be disappointed
i mean it was super nice of you and i really appreciate it
so thanks for sticking your neck out
it is fine
okay
okay Zoe it is not fine
Actually i am disappointed
i do not understand
i do not understand why you would not take that job
i do not know i just it is not for me so
look around here
you can do something about this
you have to do it though
about what
about your situation about your life
my situation
you can make it better
yeah it is possible to change things
nothing about my situation
it is pretty easy
if you stop resisting
is hurting your baby okay
i am not worried about
i am eating right i am resting and that is all you need to worry about
Zoe you know that that is not all that i am worried about
so
you have to know that i am worried about more than that by now
i know exactly what you are worried about
you are worried that the baby's going to come out dumb like me
i am not oh my God
that is what you are really worried about
you are not dumb but would you stop acting like it
this was easy
it is not that easy
this job had your name on it waiting for you
how dare you say it is that easy
how dare you
i arranged it
it was setup for you
you arranged it
you think can just come in here and arrange everything from my life right
you buy some organic crap groceries and you bring it in and you fix everything
so when you leave everything's going to be fine right
Well guess what i do not even have a high school diploma
it says right there on the application
high school diploma required
so how easy are things looking now
Mama
Mm hmm
um never mind
Honey i am up
i am just resting my eyes
what is going on
i do not know if i am just freaking out about nothing
how do you feel about Bob little
Like do you think he is a good person
do you like him
yeah haddie i work for the man
of course i think he is a good person
i mean i think he is a great politician and he is just what are you getting at
what
oh God i bet i probably sound crazy right now
you do not what
and this might be off
but Amber i just do not want her to make any bad decisions
and maybe she would listen to you if she is doing anything
okay what are you talking about right now
i just we went from there to there
Well she was packing for this trip and she was bringing like pretty sexy clothes
what are you doing
nothing
never mind
what is with the mom
i will be back
what are you doing
Mom
uh i have a mom
i hope so
i have a dad somewhere
and i have a brother named drew
he is very sweet very sensitive
yes
Actually he just text messaged me earlier to tell me that apparently my mom is having a baby
or wants to with her new boyfriend
Really
yeah
so that would be a half sibling then that you are going to have
yes
i guess
Exciting
is it going to look like me
half
half of its face will look like me
i have got quite a few of those half siblings
oh yeah
half of whom i really like
that is funny
the other half well not so much
yeah not so much
i am glad you came
yeah me too
it is fun
you are making me look like i am a political rock star coming here with somebody like you
Thank you
i am glad i could help
Need to get that
um no
you sure
i am sure
 yeah yeah we are good
 hey hey  hey hey
it good
yeah it is pretty good
so i heard you went on a school trip
yeah
how was that
it was fine i guess
so um i get the sense that small talk is not your favorite thing
yeah
um
so uh i know that your mom talked to you about us having a baby
yeah
and um
i know that is a Quite a big thing to
yeah it is
i do not know i mean we talked about it already you know it is just an uncomfortable situation
it just makes me feel a little weird
i am sorry
okay
no
you do not have to be sorry
but i want you to tell me all those things that it makes you uncomfortable
i want you to be direct with me
i am gonna be in your life
yeah
we are going to have some kind of relationship
and it can be a bad relationship or no relationship but i hope it is neither of those
so i want us to be able to be direct with each other and tell each other what is going on
because otherwise i just get one word answers and i do not know what you are thinking
i am sorry
and then i second guess everything not for you to apologize
it is just a weird situation
so tell me about it
i do not understand why you do not understand that
it is just uncomfortable
i do understand that it is weird but i want you to tell me exactly how you feel about it
you can tell me anything
this is your opportunity to tell me you hate me tell me i am a you know
i do not hate you
that is not it
it is just you know
i do not understand why everyone pretends like it is not a big deal when it is
you know it is a huge it is a huge deal
and it just makes me feel weird you know and i have to see you at school and you are significantly younger than her
and it is just all of it as a whole i am sorry
i mean you know it is like it hurts you know
it feels like she is just going to go off and start some new family with you or something
you know and it hurts
okay drew i she is not trying to start a new family all right
that is what it feels like so
drew

' Thank you'
Excuse me
you caIled Peter Kleist
Ah yes
this gentleman here is Iooking for you
Ah Peter
i am KarI Hummel
Uncle Karl
i reaIly did not expect you to meet me personaIly
a nephew i have never seen my curiosity got the better of me
any more bags
no just these
oh but you
Welcome to Austria Peter
and how is my sister
Mother's fine
she sends you her best
she wrote saying that you were awarded your master's degree
we are aII very proud
Education is a Iong and honoured tradition in our family
yeah Uncle but i have had enough of it for a while
then you are not going on for your doctorate degree
i am going on for some rest
some relaxation some fun
Back to the earth back to my roots
so that is why you have come here to Austria hmm
we aII want to know where we come from and from whom
i am particularly fascinated by that ghoulish baron on my father's side
Hmm
Otto von Kleist
the baron's name is not exactly popular around these parts
to the viIlagers he was not a fictionaI character but real and his victims were reaI people
Even now they aII go out of their way to avoid going to the castle at night
i heard the castle's being made into a hotel
yes that is so
but a hoteI for foreigners not for the Iocals
how do you feeI about it
we pass it along the way
would you Iike to take a Iook
yeah between us we might even conjure up an ancestraI ghost or two
Chuckles
 Theme music
Peter Hey Uncle what are they gonna caII the hotel
Von Kleist Horror House
Karl chuckling no
but the castle has always been caIled Schloss des Teufels
Peter Schloss what
Karl Schloss des Teufels Castle of the Devils
Peter that is not too inviting either is it
Karl it is good for tourists
Look there is your castle
Peter Schloss des Teufels
could we go up do you think
yes we have a Iittle time
Man Eva did they put up those partitions yet
Eva please please
no no no no and i say you cannot make these changes in the ceIlar
Frulein you are just a child an attractive child but i do not Iike you threatening me
i am not threatening you Herr Dortmundt it is only that the Iaw says
Herr Dortmundt
Eva
Good day
how are you
may i present my nephew Peter Kleist from America
Herr Dortmundt
it is a pleasure
Frulein
Nice to meet you
and you
Eva's one of my prized architecturaI students
she represents me on the Commission for the Preservation of NationaI Monuments
Kleist
Peter Kleist
Peter is a direct descendant of Baron von Kleist
oh reaIly
yes
SeveraI great grandfathers back of course
Baron Blood they caIled him
WeIl i hope you haven't inherited his disposition
one never knows
they say one of his favourite pastimes was to impale anyone who incurred his displeasure on stakes planting their bodies up on this tower
as a warning to others
Peter Sweet guy
i imagine if he was around to see what Herr Dortmundt was doing to his castle he might get the same idea again
Hey that might be a good gimmick to attract people to the castle again
oh sure sure
Herr Dortmundt Iikes the idea
he would stick aII of womanhood up there
i think I'd better go and check what his workers are destroying in this part of the castle
Go on busybody
Go ahead and spy on me
Ah she can be so exasperating at times
WiII you please close that door
Why do you keep opening it aII the time
to see you come in
ReaIly now
Door slams
Hey hey
Somebody
Open the door
do you hear me
Somebody please
Open the door
Distant cackling
Screams
Cackles
Fritz
Fritz
do not you ever ever dare do that to me again
Eva what is it
that stupid fiend he frightened me out of my mind
Laughs Dortmundt oh that is just Fritz the caretaker
he is gotten into the bad habit of scaring intruders
Fritz come back here
i wonder how many victims the baron tortured with these trinkets
are you aII right now
i am sorry i know
Er Peter
if you think you can tear yourself away for the time being my wife has been waiting to give you a sample of some truly Austrian home cooking
Eva how about you joining us
Peter not you buddy
some more cheesecake Peter
oh no thank you
if i eat any more I'II get as fat as the old baron
the baron was a taII man but he was not fat
WeIl Iisten to her now
how would you know
the child is right
Von Kleist was taII and thin
she must have seen a painting of him somewhere
no i did not
WeII then child how do you know what he Iooked Iike
i have seen him at the castle
Gretchen i do not Iike you teIling stories Iike that
but i have seen him sometimes on my way home from school
i can see him Iooking out from the castle waIl just Iike the nice witch said
Ah so that explains it
she is been hearing too many stories about Elisabeth HIle
then you too know about her
when the baron had her burned to death
Karl
such talk at the dinner table
Martha's right i am sorry
Come Gretchen time to go to bed
Excuse us
Peter
of course
Eva
Good night Mrs Hummel
Good night
Good night Gretchen
Good night
Good night
Good night
Bye
WeIl i am glad the name of Elisabeth HIle came up
there is something i want to show you
oh but before i show you this suppose you teII me what you know about Elisabeth HIle
as Iegend has it she was a witch put at the stake by the baron because he was afraid of her
is that aIl
WeIl no before she died she put a curse on him promising he would suffer a hundred times as much as any of his victims and he did die a horrible death
they tortured him then burned him in his own chambers
Fortunately for the castle a storm extinguished the fire before it spread too far
the baron's body was never found
but Elisabeth HIle Ieft an incantation that would bring him back to suffer again and again
this is it
Looks authentic enough
Kunik Sator Holmat
where did you get this
Up at my grandfather's place
i was just a kid then but i never threw it away
since i was coming here to Austria i thought I'd bring it along and scare up a Iittle family history while i was at it
Hmm very interesting
Seems authenticaIly old
Worth trying out or too dangerous
we Iive in an enlightened age Peter where science not only reveals the old mysteries as mere superstitions but Iittle by Iittle discovers the true mysteries of the universe
however
i would not play with the occult if i were you
One's obsession with it could be the reaI danger
it is getting Iate and i stiII have my Iectures to prepare for tomorrow
no do not get up
I'II get Eva home safely
no no that won't be necessary because i Iive right close by
WeII then stay as Iong as you Iike unless you have to rush off somewhere
Peter oh no no no
Good night then
Good night
Thanks Uncle
Good night Doctor
may i
Thank you
7 XGR
no no no no
no not here
do not read it now
WeIl you do not reaIly believe in that do you
do you stiII have the keys to the castle
Look as a trustee of the government
yeah Iisten to this for a second
they say the only place the incantation wiII work is in the room where the baron was kiIled
WeIl that should be the burned room then
it is starting to make sense now
Let's go to the castle
Come on Peter
you want me to run off in the night as your guide
have no fear mein Frulein if the ancient baron should wake up on the wrong side of the bed
I'II be there to protect you
OK
Mm hmm
does that mean yes or no
it only means that i wonder with whom i would be safer with the baron's ghost or with you
Peter oh good then that means yes
Eva are you always so sure of yourself
Peter huh
no
Eva that is good
Eva Let's go Peter after you Frulein
Hurry
the witching hour is almost here
nothing to worry about
the second incantation wiII put the old boy back where he came from
i mean if we do not dig him we'II ditch him
Come on
Door is unlocked
Door creaks
Eva giggles thump Peter Damn
Eva are you aII right
Peter yeah
Eva oh if you feeI to your right there is an oiI Iamp on the table
Peter uh huh
got it
now aII i have to do is Iight it
and then we'II be set
Let's go
it is up in the turret
over there
Mm hmm
WeIl
where to
there is a table inside
Go ahead
and now the incantation
Woo
the parchment
oh i have it here
what is that
it is an originaI plan of the castle
Eva oh the incantation of Elisabeth HIle
Kunik Sator Hol
do not kid around
Why not
because you'II invoke Elisabeth HIle's anger
Only if we do it solemnly shaII the beIls toIl
announcing the baron's spirit
how nice
Chuckles
Ready
Ready
Kunik Sator Holmat
i beseech thee oh Elisabeth HIle reach the fiery depths of heIl and bring forth the eviI spirit of Baron Otto von Kleist to this the chamber of his tortured death
Wow
what is he waiting for
Maybe he doesn't Iike us huh
BeII toIls
WeIl that er
that must be the beII of the church of St Stefan
huh
it is midnight but the beII only rang twice
twice
two o'clock
two o'clock was the hour that von Kleist was kiIled
Peter
Peter if the curse reaIly worked then if he reaIly were to come back he'd be a monster
the way he was kiIled and
yeah i know
with his skuII aII crushed tortured burned
Peter he'd be a monster
i want to go please
do not worry
Come on
Rattling
Footsteps
Footsteps approach
Peter make it go away
Break the incantation
i beg you
AII right
AII right
Kunik Sator Holmat
Change thy heart and take him away
Holmat Sator Kunik
Take him away to the darkest depths and break thy incantation
i bet it was Fritz with one of his pranks
I'II bet anything it was Fritz
it had to be
it could not have been anyone else
i hope so
that is 16 huh
yes sir
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning Herr Dortmundt
is Fritz around
Fritz
no i fired him yesterday
then he was not here Iast night
no at Ieast he should not have been
Why do you ask
Herr Dortmundt would you mind if i brought him to the castle
Man Herr Dortmundt bitte
I'II be with you in a second
I'd Iike to show you around myself if i weren't so busy
Maybe you'II come up with more gimmicks to attract American tourists
WeIl what is it
Eva Iet's go back in to the burned room again
Along one of these waIls there is got to be a hidden passage
i was up half the night studying this thing
the plan shows a corridor Ieading into another room
that could be it
what on earth are you doing
here hold this a second
Why
Just hold it
what are you going to do break the whole castle down
there is got to be another room here
who could that be
Hmm
it is probably a painting of von Kleist
but why those scratches
Maybe one of his enemies Iet his hatred out in the painting
there is something about his eyes
I'd swear they were foIlowing me
he is Iooking at me
Eva Iet's try the incantation again
what for
i must find out what happened
but you told me nothing happened
i know i did but i want to make sure
oh Peter it was at night and spooky and frightening but today everything seems so unreal
does it
what if the ghost of Elisabeth HIle is stronger than the centuries
what if it could bring the baron back
oh come on
you do not believe that yourself
it is not Iikely but i must find out
what are you thinking
that to come face to face with my ancestor from the 16th century monster or not is an experience i would not want to pass up
Bird screeches
you feeI better now
yes thank you
i felt chiIls going right through me
are you ready to start
Kunik Sator Holmat
i command you return wherever you may be
Kunik Sator Holmat

Good morning
Morning Eva
do you have a few minutes you can spare us
WeIl i have a class but i guess it can wait
WeIl you remember our talking about Elisabeth HIle and the curse she put on Baron von Kleist
yes
WeIl Iast night at the castle i invoked the curse
Did you bring the baron back from his grave
oh no it is true Professor
According to the curse the baron was supposed to come back with blood flowing from his wounds and Iast night Professor there was blood under the door
and the door a big heavy oak door gave away Iike a supernaturaI force was trying to crush through it
a spooky castle a dark night a witch's curse
it can play strange tricks on our imagination
and Iast night a doctor was kiIled
yes i know
i read about it in the paper
you see Professor if the baron should have come back he would have needed medicaI attention and he could have kiIled the doctor no
if you reaIly think the baron is here why do not you send him back

Good morning Inspector
Good morning
Eva caIled and told me about Dortmundt
Strange
Why would a man Iike that want to commit suicide
he just was not the type always active thinking of money
Hm
i do not think it was suicide
the noose was tied by an expert and there were signs of a struggle which Ieads us to suppose that someone else was present
but if it was not suicide
then who
i mean
who kiIled him
Why would anyone want to kiII him
Fritz
Fritz
he was discharged just recently and was seen in this area Iast night
we have yet to check it out but we are Iooking for him

the documents wiII be here shortly
Thank you
Mr Becker
i am Doctor Hummel
this is Eva Arnold and my nephew Peter Kleist
how do you do sir
We'd aII Iike to offer our congratulations
Thank you very much
Thank you sir
Peter Kleist
yes
Baron Otto von Kleist was an ancestor of mine
it might interest you to know Doctor that Mr Becker intends to Iive in this castle and plans to restore it to its originaI condition
oh reaIly
yes
that is Eva's speciaI field
Perhaps she could be of some help
i am sure she could
when you have a moment young Iady
i would be delighted if you would pay me a visit and share some of your knowledge with me
Er weIl thank you very much
Excuse me Mr Becker if you'd be good enough to sign this document you shaII take IegaI title to the castle
Er good day Mr Becker
Nice to have met you
Frulein do not forget i shaII be expecting you
 Organ plays
Eva Mr Becker
Herr Becker
Rattling Gasps
Herr Becker you you frightened me
Laughing i am sorry
i could not help but admire that beautifuI tapestry
where did you find it
oh in a Iittle antique shop
it was a stroke of pure Iuck
they did not even know it belonged to the castle
of course it does
how clever of you to find it
WeIl thank you
Herr Becker there is something i would Iike to teII you
oh
Go ahead dear
yes it seems that a curse has been put on Baron von Kleist by a witch
now she vowed that he would suffer a horrible death and be returned only to go through aII the agonies again
Chuckles a witch
you you believe this
WeIl but
Iet me finish please
you see when Peter first arrived we invoked the curse
we said the words that would bring the baron back to Iife
and
i do not know
so many terrible things have happened here after that that i
i know it aII sounds foolish but
Let me be the judge of that my dear
Go ahead
Horrible things have happened since then
a doctor was kiIled in his home
Herr Dortmundt was murdered right here in this castle
and now Fritz is missing
Fritz
oh he is the caretaker here in the castle
if only we could send him back
Send him back
WeIl yes
you see the parchment with Elisabeth HIle's curse also contained an invocation to send the baron back
where is the parchment now
WeIl er that is the trouble
it burned in the fireplace
Tuts what a pity
but there is another way
i just can not remember it
another way
there must be another way
you know i remember when i was a child there were other similar Iegends
but now i search and search and search my mind and i just do not do not seem to remember it
and yet
Eva
yes Herr Becker
Please enough of that
Eva
oh yes sir
would you drape the tapestry over the railing
I'd Iike to see how it Iooks hanging
Certainly
Like this
Eva is something wrong
no it is that
it is just that for for a moment i thought that
Why not put it in your work room untiI we decide where to hang it
yes sir
after which you'd better get some rest do not you think
yes sir
Forgive me
Certainly my dear
Certainly
Screams
no

i never want to come back here again
Please
Please never
Peter please
AII right darling
HALLS OF RESlDENCE
Eva i
do not say anything
we do not need words
no matter darling what Becker or anyone else says i
Look i do not care about anybody else
i believe you
the only one who matters is you
I'd stiII feeI better if you stayed at my uncle's place for a few days
oh no I'II be aII right
do not worry about me
i won't be alone there
there are Iots of students who stay over the weekend
Listen I'II give you my car and then you pick me up in the morning OK
a kiss first
no no no do not get out
and weIl thank you for for everything
Door opens
Growling
Screams
Taxi
oh
Open
Open the door
the door
the door please
Open the door
Eva what is it
the monster
my God
what is wrong
what happened
it was the monster
the baron
it was the baron
the baron
i know it was
no no
he is stiII out there
Eva you must get a hold of yourself
it was the monster
it was
Continues sobbing
no do not Eva
do not
Easy easy
may we
oh come in come in
how are you
Fine
Finishing a few assignments
if you are busy we can
no i am almost finished
as you know part of my work here at the university involves research in extrasensory perception
each card shows either a circle a Iine or a rectangle
my average score is one out of three and that is exactly what chance predicts and
do these equations have anything to do with your caIling about er about what happened Iast night
Just my way of Ieading up to the subject
the fact is i haven't been thinking of anything else
then you do believe that i saw someone or something in my room and on the streets
i am convinced that you did
do you believe it was the baron
i believe that it could have been
do you realise what that means
a human spirit brought back to Iife after centuries
it makes the greatest discovery Iook triviaI by comparison
Try to remember what did he Iook Iike
oh it was just horrible
i reaIly do not want to talk about it Peter if you do not mind
i do not blame you
you reaIly had a terrifying experience
if it was the baron then both your Iives are in danger
He'II try again
but why
because he fears you'II send him back
but we can not
the parchment with Elisabeth HIle's curse burned
it is gone
there may be stiII another way
you know of one
about a year ago we were interviewing subjects for ESP right here in this classroom
for the most part we came up with results that were about average but with one very notable exception
a woman named Christina Hoffmann
a former teacher
Did you test her with these Uncle
yes
and by many other methods
her results were astounding
Far surpassing random or chance probabilities
but what makes you think that she can help us
because Christina Hoffmann claims and i believe her that she is not only clairvoyant but a medium between the Iiving and the dead
Why did you come here
i feel
i feeI something
no i do not want to talk to you
Christina you are the only one who may be able to help us
Christina no
no
it may be too Iate for aII of us
so you have come to talk to me about the baron
Remarkable
it was a foolish thing you did
and a dangerous thing
he wiII destroy you if he can
Peter but why
Only those present the day the speII was invoked have the power to eliminate it
Peter you mean Eva and i
Thus the baron has only you two to fear
Christina can you help us
no i cannot
i must not
but the parchment with Elisabeth HIle's invocation burned and with it the order to send him back
Please
Please you are the only one who can help us
Please
i told you i can do nothing
Elisabeth HIle invoked the curse
Only she can teII you its secret
but she is dead
Scoffs oh mortals are such fools
Once you kiIled innocent witches and now you bring murderers back to Iife
it was my ancestor who burned her at the stake
i can make amends with your help
this once belonged to Elisabeth HIle
Tonight we'II go to the place where she was burned at the stake
 Drumming
Christina Peter
Eva
Elisabeth these two who brought back your murderer would speak with you
the wiII of thy tortured spirit has been placed in these unknowing hands
Come speak to us Elisabeth
Come before the rock that shaII forever mark the place of thy death
Come Elisabeth
Moaning
Repeats distant voice you Iost the parchment
Fools
the curse shaII stand forever
Echoing
and the baron shaII suffer forever
the baron can be destroyed only by those he has himself destroyed
now because of you i have made him suffer again
and for that i am in your debt
Moans
i wiII teII you this
you have the power to destroy him to make him suffer again the agonies of heIl
Use it
before it is too Iate
Screeching
Woman Death awaits
Death
you knew he sees Elisabeth HIle
you cannot escape him Christina
you cannot escape him
i appreciate your coming here today and i promise i wiII not keep you Iong
but Frulein Arnold
can not you teII me something more about the man you saw in your room the other night
no Inspector i cannot
i hardly saw his face
i only saw his hands and they were crushed and burned and bloodied
it was a nightmare Inspector
Inspector is it reaIly necessary to make Eva go through this again
i am afraid so
you see the murderer of Dortmundt is stiII at Iarge
and Fritz
my men are stiII Iooking for him
Inspector what if we told you that we had another theory as to what happened to Herr Dortmundt and possibly Fritz as weIl
I'd be most interested
Eva you see Inspector it involves a curse a curse put on Baron von Kleist 300 years ago
Von Kleist
Baron Blood
Eva Exactly
300 years ago
yes and we believe the curse has brought him back to Iife
and that he kiIled Dortmundt and attacked Eva in the castle
and then he tried to kiII her
Eva yes i am certain of it
Frulein we are weII aware of your interest in historicaI archives
Mr Kleist we are aware also of your emotionaI involvement in this particular castle
you are both young impressionable
but you Herr Professor
you said yourself there have been other disappearances a fisherman a viIlager on his way home and then that peddler aII gone without a trace
yes and of course aII in the vicinity of the castle
i am afraid your theories are not of much use to me
is that aIl Inspector
for the moment yes
Thank you
Thank you for your assistance
i just do not understand that inspector
Four people disappear and he doesn't care
and aII in the vicinity of the castle
i do not get it
my God i never stopped to think that
she passes by there every day on her way from school
who
Gretchen
Rustling
Karl how stupid of me not to think of it
Hurry
Karl Gretchen
Gretchen
are you aII right
i feII off my bike
oh Iook she is bleeding
do you have a handkerchief
it doesn't hurt much
Thank God it is only a scratch
what happened Gretchen
i stopped to Iook at the castle and i hurt myself when i
i tried to jump on my bike
WeIl thank goodness that is aIl
i saw the bushes move because a ghost was there
Eva Look Doctor
Mr Becker is there aII by himself
do not you think we should warn him of this
Becker i appreciate your concern Doctor Hummel
i respect your opinion though i do think it is a bit far fetched
i am afraid Eva can not consider it far fetched
i understand your apprehension sir
in view of the strange things she appears to have seen strange enough to cause her to Ieave my employment
i hope this talk is not going to give this young Iady nightmares
she is my daughter Gretchen
Chuckling HeIlo Gretchen
Lovely child
oh i am very happy to announce that i have completed the restoration of the castle including a few items that may surprise even you dear Eva
Why do not you drop by this evening
WeIl i do not know sir
AII of you
AII of you of course
i promise you won't be disappointed Doctor Hummel
Thank you
oh and do be carefuI of these mountain roads
as you know they can be quite treacherous after dark
Laughs UntiI tonight then
Mr Becker is the ghost
what do you mean darling
I'd know him anywhere
his eyes burn Iike fire
AII right Gretchen that is enough now
Go out and play yeah
Let's go and wash up first
then you can go out and play in the garden
Wait a moment
Hmm
what do we reaIly know about Becker
PersonaIly nothing
who is he
where did he come from
Why did he
how is it he suddenly appeared at the auction
and where did he get his money
it is true his background has a Iittle mystery about it
and another thing he is the only one who is not afraid to stay by himself in the castle
and then his invitation for tonight was pretty weird
and yet what about his face
what do you mean
you know the man who was in my room who chased me aII over the castle he was not even human Iooking
i do not know
if he is the baron it is possible that he has the power to change his appearance
but you know i remember now that when i mentioned the name of Elisabeth HIle for the first time
Herr Becker Iooked weIl he Iooked stricken
if Becker is the baron then you must realise how dangerous it is to go to the castle tonight
there are too many unknown quantities to this mystery and there is no IogicaI procedure to its solution
Peter we can not drop everything right now just when Karl Just when it may seem too dangerous to go further Peter
but Uncle we must go
it is the only way we can get the proof
if only we knew what Elisabeth HIle meant when she said we had the power to destroy him
Maybe she meant the amulet
the amulet
Eva Peter Iook
Peter what
Up there that painting
is not that the one we saw
the night of the incantation exactly
Becker Good evening my dear friends
Please please come in
Chuckling i am reaIly delighted to see you
i was afraid you might have changed your minds
Come
Good evening Mr Becker
i am so glad you could come Doctor
um Herr Becker
is not that Baron von Kleist
yes i believe it to be the only true portrait of the baron in existence
WeIl it reaIly seems very odd to me Herr Becker that the whole painting was restored except for the face
Artistic integrity dear Eva
since no one knows what the baron actuaIly Iooked Iike would you have a painter give him a face that was not truly his own
i understand that he was a sadist and a murderer
and quite probably insane
Sadist
Murderer
Matters of terminology
Insane
Hmm
i rather think not
he was much too clever
but such cleverness goes hand in hand with insanity do not you think
you are the scientist Doctor
but Iet's not bore these children with clinicaI analyses
I'd Iike to show you something more realistic
Excuse me dear Eva
now if you'II aII just foIlow me please
WeIl what do you think
Did you see that
my God it is pretty startling even for a castle Iike Schloss des Teufels
but they seem so Iife Iike
Anybody would think they were real
a magnificent effect Herr Becker
if it is just an effect
oh Peter
i have restored not only the furniture of the castle
i have tried to recreate the atmosphere the personality of its originaI owner
the baron's wiII not only dominated this castle but aII the vaIley below
the people were necessary only for his convenience
those whom he found inconvenient
Chuckles FoIlow me
i am particularly pleased with the meticulous and exacting restoration of this dungeon
with a Iittle imagination you should be able to envision the tortures and hear the screams that echoed through here
Screams echoing
those recorded screams in the baron's day were real
Hours perhaps
Entertaining
it is disgusting and horrible and i
I'd Iike to Ieave please
it is aII very fascinating but i am afraid we must be going
may we assist you upstairs
Thank you no
but please come back
there are many more things i would Iike to ask you Herr Becker
Perhaps you would Iike to stay
Peter please
Chuckles i understand
Let's go
it was a pleasure
Good night
do come back soon for a Ionger visit
a much Ionger visit
Auf Wiedersehen
i am sure he is the baron
but if he is why did he Iet us go
Possibly he is just playing a game
do you have the amulet
oh yes it is here
we have got to try to send his ghost back
Hurry
Let's go
but Iet's talk to him before sending him back
this opportunity is never gonna come again
Think what it would mean to actuaIly speak with someone from the past
Peter please
Peter
you have unleashed a monster on the world
you must try to send him back
Becker oh
i am disappointed Doctor
is your scientific interest waning
for a man in your position
i would have expected more inteIlectuaI curiosity
Baron Otto von Kleist
what a pity Eva you are Baron von Kleist that circumstances oblige me to eliminate my only Iiving male descendant
Go back
Go back
Go back
Go back to wherever you came from
Go back
Child
do you think you can destroy me with a trinket
Good shot Doctor
Chuckles
Baron Iaughs
Sizzling
Baron Iaughs Peter no
no
now you shaII taste the pain the exquisite agony the fate you'd planned for me
Only Iuckily for you there wiII be no coming back

you shaII die
Peter no

Well that is good
yes that is good
what is in this one
you are small
i never thought you'd be small
and this one
this is very large
what is in it then a bedstead
it is my mother's piano
Baines tell them to carry in pairs
Take all the boxes table and the suitcases

she looks tired
she is stunted that is one thing
and the big case
no no
Just the trunks and the boxes as i explained
no it can not come now
it must
she wants it to come
yes so do i but there are too few of us here to carry it now
Too heavy
what you mean you do not want your clothing or kitchenware to come
is that what you mean
we can not leave the piano
Let's not discuss this any further
i am very pleased that you arrived safely
but we must know if they can come back directly for it
could i apologise for the delay
after they have taken the other things
might i suggest that you prepare yourself for a difficult journey
the bush will tear clothing and the mud is very deep in places
what do they think they are doing
we do not have time for this
what is the matter
Why are they stopping
that is the way to the burial grounds
it is tapu
they want more money
they are trying to make two days out of it
no
no they know another track to the side of this
Septimus now take that off
Take that off
Watch your feet
Mind your feet
Septimus
Please stop it
Stop it
Stop please
you will tear it

Septimus now stop

be careful
Arm down
if you cannot have a ceremony together you will have at least a photograph
Careful
the lace is most fragile
my real father was a famous German composer
they met when my mother was an opera singer in Luxembourg
Why
i want to be in the photograph
Going to leave the cloth here
no no
it is just to keep the chair dry
we must have slipped on the planks
they have gotten very greasy
Get in that chair
Pull the tarpaulin off
i am sorry it rained
we have not light enough inside
shall i have the umbrella on this side on t'other
on t'other
on t'other
can you take this please
and sitting
very still
and where did they get married
in an enormous forest with fairies as bridesmaids each holding a little elf's hand
no i tell a lie
it was in a small country church in the mountains
which mountains are those dear
the Pyrenees
i have never been there
Mother used to sing songs in German and her voice echoed across the valleys
that was before the accident
and what happened
one day while my mother and father were singing together in the forest a great storm blew up
but so passionate was the singing that they did not notice
they did not stop as rain began to fall
and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bold of lightning came out of the sky and struck my father who lit up like a torch
at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb
she never spoke another word
oh dear
not another word
Well from the shock
yes
it would be
Terrible
Terrible
Terrible terrible
Sorry
i have to go away for some days
some Maori land i am interested in which i may buy very reasonably
Well i hope you will spend the time to get settled in
and perhaps in some ways we could start again
all right
i am not able to read
Please take us back to the beach where we landed
i am sorry
i can not do that
i do not have the time
Goodbye
i can not take you there
i can not do it
Mumma
Mumma watch me
Look
Mumma
Mumma

Well you have stopped combing your hair which is a good thing
it was looking overdone

Show him Nessie
the Reverend's going to use animal blood
no doubt it will be very dramatic
Very dramatic
Tea
Morag what would you think if someone were to play a kitchen table
Like it were a piano
Like it were a piano
it is strange is not it
i mean it is not a piano
it doesn't make any sound
Biscuits
no no sound
i knew she was mute but now i am thinking perhaps it is more than that
i wonder if she is not brain affected
Shush
no sound at all
no
it was a table
Well she was very violent with the gown
she tore off a chunk of lace
i have had been here to see it
I'd have sworn you she'd have used her teeth and wiped her feet on it
it hasn't come to anything yet
it is simply a concern that is all
yes
yes of course
a concern
there is something to be said for silence
Indeed
Cotton
with time i am sure she will become affectionate
Sure there is nothing so easy to like as a pet
and they are quite silent
the grand old Duke of York he had ten thousand men
he marched them up and up and marched them down again
those 80 acres across the stream what do you think of them
i do not have any money
what are you on about
I'd like to make a swap
what for
the piano
what the piano on the beach
it is not marshy is it
no
Baines the music lover
i never would have thought
Hidden talents George
I'd have to get lessons
it would not be much use without them
yes i suppose you would
Ada can play
i have it in a letter that she plays very well
she is been playing since she was five or six
what on
Well on on your piano
that is the swap
what is she saying
she says it is her piano and she won't have him touch it
he can not read
he is ignorant
he wants to improve himself and you will be able to play it
Teach him how to look after it
you can not go on like this
we are a family now
we all make sacrifices and so will you
you will teach him and i will see to it
a Broadwood
a fine instrument
i have not seen one here nor in New South Wales where i have tuned 200

i hope you have scrubbed your hands
it is in tune
it is in tune

Mom would like to see what you can play
I'd rather not play

Slowly slowly
Lift your skirt

Higher

Lift it higher

you need another wife
Undo your dress
i want to see your arms
Play
two keys
i shall listen hard at rehearsal because i live too far to come often
which sign is the word rehearsal
i can not imagine a fate worse than being dumb
to be deaf
Aye
Deaf too
Terrible
Awful
to tell you the whole truth mother says most people speak rubbish and it is not worth the listen
Well that is a strong opinion
Aye
it is unholy
what do they say
are they selling
Offer blankets for half the land
Twelve
Offer the guns Baines
Offer the guns
what do they want the land for
they won't do anything with it
they do not cultivate it they do not burn it back
nothing
i mean how do they even know that it is theirs
Thought i might as well mark it out as we agreed
yes why not
Well Ada says you are doing well with the piano
I'd like to come and hear you play
what do you play
nothing just yet
no
Ada four keys
Why five
i just want to lie
all right all right five
Early in the month of may
the angels were sweetly singin'
a young man on his deathbed lay
for love of Barbara Allen
we are running late
if you haven't got your lip colour on can you line up behind Rose please
you all been to the lavatory
yes
i want no running on the stage
they are bringing in extra chairs
do not touch the blood
Look who is here
the musical Mr Baines
what are you going to play for us tonight
Twinkle Twinkle George
how about a little tinkle tinkle George
Perhaps you would like to turn pages for Nessi
she is playing for the children
i am in costume
i am very pleased you have taken up the piano
now where is this song
George excuse me
how about Mary had a little Lamb
or a polka
Come on Geroge what is it to be
Fools
Come on George
Move along
Ladies and gentlemen could you take your seats please
we are about to begin
Early in the month of may
the angels were sweetly singin'
a young man on his deathbed lay
for love of Barbara Allen
Out of there sprung a red rose full
and out of it a briar
then they flew up to the high church wall
Till they could go no higher
and then they came in a true love's lock
the roses and sweet briar
and so the young maid came upon each and all of Bluebeard's missing wives
their severed heads still bleeding their eyes still crying
Slow down Nessie
Slow down
but hush
who comes
i am home early my sweet wife
where art thou
oh
Husband
what a surprise
yes wife
a surprise indeed
so now you know my secret
no
no
you the youngest and sweetest of all my wives
no must be prepared to die
no
no
Wait
i shall not wait
Bare your neck
Chief I'd like to introduce you
this is Mrs Williams this is Mrs Parsons this is Mrs Reid this is Miss Palmer and this is Miss Kerr
Very very nice
do what you like
Play what you like
i want to lie together without clothes on
how many would that be
yes
Ten keys
what the clock say Missa Tewart
never behave like that
never nowhere
i am greatly shamed
you have shamed these trunks
i know why Mr Baines can not play the piano
you missed some here
she never gives him a turn
she just plays what she pleases
and sometimes she doesn't play at all
when is the next lesson
Tomorrow
i have given the piano back to you
i have had enough
the arrangement is making you a whore and me wretched
i want you to care for me but you can not
it is yours
Leave
Go on go
Stop right there
this is not yours
what are you doing with the piano
Hmm
he is given it to us
Put that down
Put it down
you are cunning Ada
i have seen through you
i am not going to lose the land this way
Stay there
Hori George do not wanna see nobody
he is sick
you got the tupeka for Hira
no
Baines
Baines
Baines look
i do not think you should have given up the piano
i will make sure you are properly taught
Music on sheets and so on
i do not want to learn
you do not want to learn
no
but our bargain
i can not afford the piano if you mean me to pay
no no payment
i have given it back
i am not sure i want it myself
it was more to your wife that i gave it
oh i see
Well
i expect she will appreciate it
this is all i have
Bring that back
is it all right
Why do not you play something
what will i play
Play a jig
do i know any jigs
Play a song then
Why won't she play
we get the thing back she just wanders off
Keep playing
Wait
Wait
Why
Why can not i
i shan't practise and i do not care
Blast and damn
Bugger her
Bloody bloody bugger her
Let her fall face down in boiling bloody mud
Let a mad dog bite her till she bleeds
where is your mother
where is she gone
TO HELL
so what brings you here
Did you leave something
i have not found anything
does he know something
the piano was not harmed
it arrived safely
would you like to sit
i am going to sit
Ada
Ada
i am unhappy
because i want you because my mind has seized on you and can think of nothing else
this is why i suffer
i am sick with longing
i do not eat
i do not sleep
so if you have come with no feeling for me then go
Go
Go
Get out
Leave
what
Whisper it
now you are going i am miserable
Why is that
Ada i need to know what will you do
will you come again
Wait
i do not know what you are thinking
does this mean something to you
i already miss you
Ada do you love me
Come tomorrow
if you are serious come tomorrow
Mumma stay still
MUMMA
MUMMA
THEY'RE PLAYlNG YOUR PlANO
here Papa
you should not have gone up there should you
i do not like it and nor does Papa
we can play cards if you like
she is asleep
Look
one night she was found on the road to London
Grandpa said her feet were cut very badly
she could not walk for a week
Ada
Alisdair is it because of our play
have the natives aggressed you
Well i will have to say
you have done the wrong thing here
you have put the latch on the outside
you see
now when you close the door it will be the Maoris that lock you in
you see
with the latch on that side you are quite trapped
Quite trapped
we have just come from George Baines
they have taken him over
no wonder he is leaving
he got in too deep with the natives
they sit on his floors as proud as kings
but without any shred of manners
he is quite altered
as if they have been trying some native witchcraft on him
Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone
so Baines is packing up
Well he is nothing to pack but he is leaving
and it is just as well
Nessie has foolishly grown fond of him
we have had some tears
Stop it
Stop
STOP
i am frightened of the way back
we must leave in good light
will we be safe
oh yes
if you leave now i am sure of it
Nessie hold this
you know i am thinking of the piano
she does not play the piano as we do Nessie
Up
Up
no
she is a strange creature
and her playing is strange like a mood that passes into you
Up
now your playing is plain and true and that is what i like
to have a sound creep inside you is not at all pleasant
what is that
it is a pigeon
i should have waited
i want to touch you
Why can not i touch you
do not you like me
Come on Lucky
who is gonna be my friend
i am coming to get you
we must get on
i have decided to trust you to stay here
you won't see Baines
Good
Good
Perhaps with time you might come to like me
Stop complaining i said
and be quiet
you just have to be naked until i finish washing and drying your clothes
i do not mind if you are cold
be quiet
no we are not supposed to visit him
what
the grand old Duke of York he had ten thousand men
he marched them up to the top of the hill
and marched them down again
and when they are up they are up
and when they are down they are down
and when they are only halfway up they are neither up nor down
Crooked Mister Tewart
Crooked
Mother want me to give this to Mr Baines
i thought maybe it was not the proper thing to do
shall i open it
no
Give it to me
Why
i trusted you
i TRUSTED YOU
i TRUSTED YOU
D'YOU HEAR
Why do you make me hurt you
we could be happy
YOU MAKE ME ANGRY
SPEAK
YOU LlED TO ME
SPEAK
OR BY GOD YOU WlLL ANSWER FOR THlS
DO YOU LOVE HlM
DO YOU
IS IT HlM YOU LOVE
SHE SAYS
NO
MOTHER
MOTHER
Mumma
you give this to Baines
Tell him if he ever sees her again i will take off another and another and another
Mumma
RUN
what has happened
Hush hush
what is it
you are not to see her he will chop her up
what happened
Tell me
TELL ME
where is she
Ssh
Quiet down
Quiet down
where is she
HE CHOPPED IT OFF
what did she tell him
what did she tell him
i am going to crush his skull
NO
NO
NO
he will chop them off
you pushed me too hard
you cannot send love to him
you cannot do that
Just even even to think about it makes me very angry
i meant to love you
i clipped your wing that is all
we will be together
you will see it will be better
are you hot
my sweet love bird
are you feeling better
what
Look at you
it is your face
i have had that face in my head hating it
but now i am here seeing it it is nothing
you have your marks
you look at me through your eyes
you are even afraid of me
Get up
Baines has Ada ever spoken to you
you mean in signs
no
Words
have you ever heard words
no
not words
you never thought you heard words
i heard it here
i heard her voice
there in my head
the lips did not make the words
but yet the harder i listened the clearer i heard her
you punished her wrongly
it was me my fault
she said
i am afraid of my will of what it might do
it is so strange and strong
she said
i have to go
Let me go
Let Baines take me away
Let him try and save me
i wish her gone
i wish you gone
i want to wake up and find that this was all a dream
that is what i want
it was a terrible shock
oh dear
no
she needs it
she must have it
what did she say
she said Throw the piano overboard
it is quite safe
they are managing
she doesn't want it
she says it is spoiled
i have been given the key
i will have it mended
Please Ada
Ada
you will regret it
it is your piano i want you to have it
she doesn't want it
Sit down
Throw it over
Stop
all right we will throw it over
'What a death
'What a chance
'What a surprise
'My will has chosen life
'Still it has had me spooked and many others besides
'I teach piano now in Nelson
'George has fashioned me a metal fingertip
'I' m quite the town freak which satisfies
'I am learning to speak
'My sound is still so bad i feel ashamed
'I practise only when i am alone and it is dark'
'At night i think of my piano in its ocean grave' and sometimes of myself floating above it
'Down there everything is so still and silent that it lulls me to sleep
'It is a weird lullaby and so it is
'It is mine'' there is a silence where hath been no sound
' there is a silence where no sound may be
' in the cold grave under the deep deep sea'so what you are eating is not technically yogurt
it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures
it is really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness
Well that is very interesting
it is also not pink and has no berries
yeah but it doesn't really answer my question
what was your question again
do you want some
Ah
Right
no
i am lactose intolerant
Right
so gas
yeah got it
Well good night
what are you doing
there was a draft
PENNY
i did not feel a draft
Why do not we just go into your
oh yeah
Maybe we should slow things down a little
no i did not mean to go into your apartment to go fast
no i know
i know what you meant
it is just this is only our first date
okay
Sure
no problem
Why do not we just figure out where we are going and when we want to get there
and then rate of speed equals distance over time
Solve for R
or we could just wing it
that might work too
Good night Leonard
Good night
he is coming
Screen saver
oh hey Leonard
how was your date
Bite me
Sheldon how could you just sit there and let them spy on me
they were clever
they exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing
you should thank us
when future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned this right here is the black box
what are you talking about
the date went fine
she said she wants to slow things down
okay so she said she wants to slow things down
it is like saying i am really enjoying this meal
i am going to slow down and savor it
no it is like this fish tastes bad so i am gonna slow down and spit it out
Well no
we sort of decided to wing it
oh even i know that is lame
okay
all right
Let's assume your hypothesis
we went to dinner we talked we laughed we kissed
where could i have gone wrong
Think back Leonard
the littlest things can set women off
Like Hey the waitress is hot
i bet we could get her to come home with us
or how much does your mom weigh
i wanna know what i am getting into
i did not say anything like that
Good because they do not work
they do not care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate
Sadly that is my home run swing
Look everything went fine
i did not even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters
that woman across the hall is into me
Let's go to the tape
Look at her reaction to the good night kiss
no change in respiration pupils undilated no flushing of the chest
Nice close up by the way
Interesting
her jaws are clenched
no tongue access
Clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans
that is not a bad sign
Please
you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement
and the worst sign of all is you are here and not there
i am not there because i am taking things slow
which by the way compared to you guys approaches warp speed
and take down that camera
he was a lot more fun when he had no hope
Give him time
hi
oh hi Penny
yeah FYl the hot water is inadequate on Machine 2 so colors only
Four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle
so I'd avoid using that for your delicates
Thanks
Well good Lord
Why do not you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock
Sheldon may i ask you a question
i would prefer that you not but i won't go so far as to forbid it
all right i heard yes so
okay here is my question
has Leonard ever dated you know a regular girl
Well i assume you are not referring to digestive regularity
because i have come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate
no i meant has he ever been involved with someone who was not a brainiac
oh
Well a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a Ph D in French literature
how is that not a brainiac
Well for one thing she was French
for another it was literature
so
do you think that if Leonard and i keep dating he will eventually get bored with me
that depends
on what
do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics
no
do you speak Klingon
no
you know any card tricks
okay
i get it
Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college
Why would you lie about that
he was going on about this college and that grad school and i did not want him to think i was some kind of stupid loser
you thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate
there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates
yeah but you are neither
Right
okay look this is between you and me
you cannot tell Leonard any of this
you are asking me to keep a secret
yeah
Well i am sorry
you would've had to express that desire before revealing the secret so that i could choose whether i wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping
you can not impose a secret on an ex post facto basis
what
Secret keeping is a complicated endeavor
one has to be concerned not only about what one says but about facial expressions autonomic reflexes
when i try to deceive i myself have more nervous tics than a Lyme disease research facility
it is a joke
it relies on the homonymic relationship between tick the bloodsucking arachnid and tic the involuntary muscular contraction
CHUCKLES
i made it up myself
okay look if Leonard finds out that i lied i will absolutely die of embarrassment
Physiologically impossible
oh Sheldon please
Look i am asking you as a friend
you are saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences
Well yeah
Interesting
one more question
Perhaps i should've led with this
when did we become friends
i e i could not become Green Lantern unless i was chosen by the Guardians of Oa
Given enough startup capital and an adequate research facility i could be Batman
you could be Batman
Sure
IN DEEP VOlCE
i am Batman
IN NORMAL VOlCE
See
hi guys
Hey
hi Penny
Hey
if you are not doing anything Friday night i thought we could go see a movie
you know i think i have the dinner shift on Friday
okay
what about Saturday
you know i am not sure
the manager hasn't posted the schedule
how about i let you know
Great
okay
so you just let me know when you know
okay so oh God i am the bad fish
what did i do wrong
Why are you asking me
i have no information about your interactions with Penny nor do i have any method of learning such things
LEONARD
what does that mean
nothing
you seem to be implying a back channel between me and Penny
where obviously none exists
no i did not
i just think you need to be careful how you phrase things sir
what is going on with you
Well i might ask you the same question
Why do you drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me but exist between you and Penny a person to whom i barely speak
what is wrong with your face
there is no reason to bring my looks into this
Good day Leonard
what
i said good day
Good day
Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice
our soup of the day you must release me from my oath
Sheldon i am working
Why do not you take a minute to decide
i can not keep your secret Penny
i am going to fold like an energy based de novo protein in conformational space
Like a Renaissance triptych
Like a cheap suit
Look why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret
i am constitutionally incapable
that is why i was refused clearance for a government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider beneath a fake agricultural station 12 5 miles southeast of Traverse City Michigan
which you did not hear about from me
Look just forget i told you about me not graduating from community college okay
Forget
you want me to forget
this mind does not forget
i haven't forgotten a thing since the day my mother stopped breastfeeding me
it was a drizzly Tuesday
okay
you promised me you would keep my secret so you are just gonna have to figure out a way to do it
Leonard i am moving out
what do you mean you are moving out
Why
there doesn't have to be a reason
yeah there kind of does
not necessarily
this is a classic example of Mnchausen's trilemma
Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub reasons leading to regression or it tracks back to axiomatic statements or it is ultimately circular i e i am moving out because i am moving out
i am still confused
Leonard i do not see how i could've made it any simpler
Hey qu'est ce que c'up
we just got back from that exhibit of those plasticized cadavers
some of those skinless chicks were hot
if you will excuse me i am going to pack
that is kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia
it is not you Howard
he says he is moving out
what did you do
Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television
no
Did you take a Band Aid off in front of him
no
Did you buy generic ketchup
Forget to rinse the sink
Talk to him through the bathroom door
Adjust the thermostat
Cook with cilantro
Pronounce the T in often
no
Did you make fun of trains
i did not do anything
he is just gone insane
Well we all knew this day was coming
that was fast
it is my pre packed disaster evacuation bag
it is recommended by the Department of Homeland Security
and Sarah Connor
where are you gonna live
Until i find a permanent place i will stay with friends
Bye
Well but you can not stay with me
i have a teeny tiny apartment
Excuse me but is not hosting guests an aspect of manushya yajna one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder
i hate trains
do not be ridiculous
you love trains
yes i do
Come on
See you later Leonard
this could work
INDlAN MUSlC PLAYlNG ON TELEVlSION
this is a very old building
Sixty years
Used to be a watch factory
uh oh
what
do not you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials
not until now
i can not believe i did not bring my Geiger counter
yeah i had it on my bed and i did not pack it
lf you are not comfortable staying here i am kidding
i packed it
it was a joke
yeah i was subverting the conversational expectations
i believe they call that the old switcheroo
Terrific
is that woman Aishwarya Rai
yes
is not she an amazing actress
Actually I'd say she is a poor man's Madhuri Dixit
how dare you
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess
by comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute
Sorry i did not mean to offend you
Obviously you are not that familiar with Indian cinema
DOORBELL RlNGS
who is it
RAJESH IN HlGH PlTCHED VOlCE
Stripper gram
Tag
you are it
should not you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire
i have never slept on an air mattress before
no lumbar support whatsoever
Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench
i do not see any way to get a park bench in here
do you wanna switch
no
that is fine
i am perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle
Get out of bed
we are switching
now only if you want to
Just get in the bed
MRS WOLOWlTZ
what is going on
are you boys roughhousing
we are just talking Ma
if you do not settle down right now l'm not gonna let you have any more sleepovers
for God's sake Ma i am 27 years old
and it is not even a school night
Comfy now
Eh
that poster of Halle Berry is a little unnerving
so do not look at it
she is like my fourth favorite Catwoman
no kidding
yeah Julie Newmar Michelle Pfeiffer Eartha Kitt and then her
what about Lee Meriwether
oh i forgot about Lee Meriwether
Well i am glad that is settled
that makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite Catwoman
Julie Newmar Michelle Pfeiffer Eartha Kitt Lee Meriwether
Please i am begging you go to sleep
i am trying
i am counting Catwomen
she did make a fine mutant in the X Men movies though
oh for God's sake
she is not my favorite of the X Men
in order that'd be Wolverine Cyclops
i forgot Professor X
Professor X Wolverine Cyclops Iceman then Storm Angel the Bea no wait Nightcrawler
Professor X Nightcrawler Wolverine Cyclops Iceman then Storm Angel
DOOR KNOCKS
LEONARD
i am coming
Hey
there he is
there is my old buddy bud bud
what is with him
Koothrappali dumped him on me
he could not get to sleep so i gave him a glass of milk with a handful of my mom's Valium in it
but he still would not shut up so tag you are it
i am back
i still do not know why you left
i can not tell you
Why not
i promised Penny
Promised Penny what
that i would not tell you the secret
Shh
what secret
Tell me the secret
Mom smokes in the car
Jesus is okay with it but we can not tell Dad
not that secret the other secret
IN DEEP VOlCE
i am Batman
Damn it Sheldon
you said Penny told you a secret
what is the secret
IN NORMAL VOlCE
okay i will tell you but you can not tell Leonard
i promise
Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she is not smart enough for Leonard
so it is nothing i did
it is her problem
i drank milk that tasted funny
Penny thinks i am too smart for her
that is ridiculous
i know
most of your work is extremely derivative
and do not worry that is not a secret
Everybody knows
hi
yeah hi
Listen
i know what is been bothering you about us and i have the answer
what are you talking about
i wanna say that it is not Sheldon's fault
he tried very hard to keep your secret
if Howard hadn't drugged him he would've taken it to his grave
he told you
yes but it is okay
now that we know what the problem is there is a simple solution
Pasadena City College
a place for fun a place for knowledge
See this man here is playing Hacky Sack and this girl's gonna be a paralegal
oh
i get it because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can not date a girl without a fancy college degree
Well it is really not that fancy
it is just a city college
Right but i have to have some sort of degree to date you
that doesn't matter to me at all
so it is fine with you if i am not smart
Absolutely
okay this time i know where i went wrong

Bid me discourse
i will enchant thine ear
Shakespeare
in Japan ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion
in a country where married couples do not go out arm in arm much less say i love you out loud intuitive understanding is everything
the idea that a husband and wife should embrace and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing
however to go out dancing with someone else would be misunderstood and prove more shameful
Nonetheless even for Japanese people there is a secret wonder about the joys that dance can bring
shall we dance
Hisako that is enough
Let's go to one more bar
Even accountants need to be entertained
it is no fun drinking with co workers
it is not fair

do you really like it so much
not a matter of like or dislike it is my job
Nine o'clock
Time to go home

for what i am about to receive
Your father rarely stays out late
you seem very pleased
he really should get out and enjoy himself more often
Why do you say that
do not you think he is too serious
he works hard then comes straight home every day
he bought us this house
that is what fathers do
i feel kind of bad
it is not as if you are lazing around
i suppose so
i am glad you understand
but he does seem depressed lately
Poor dear gets up before either of us
so get up and make his breakfast
he says i do not have to
so that is being in love
you look so happy
i haven't worked for thirteen years

everyone calls me Tamako sensei
how do you do
Pleased to meet you
are you all beginners
my wife dragged me to a ballroom dance circle
okay so how should we do this
i do not mind starting from the very basics
Let's start with party dancing then gradually move on to the modern and Latin steps
i know those terms but these two probably do not know anything about the various dances
Good point
Let me explain
the social dances include the waltz tango the slow fox trot quick step and the Vienna waltz
These make up the modern dances
the rumba cha cha cha samba paso double and jive constitute the five Latin dances
Together these are the ten competitive dances and each qualifies for competition
i hope one day you will get to try them all
Today we will start with the mambo
the mambo and the jitterbug are non competitive but you will fear no party if you learn them
they are excellent foundations for ballroom dancing
Lead with your left foot
Your weight goes on your right foot
Bring the left up to meet the right
Go back with your right
Take the weight on your left
then right up to the left
that is one set
Left right left right left right
the first two are quick
Feet together is a slow step
two quick equals one slow
is that clear
Simple is not it
These are the mambo's basic steps
Let's try with a partner
you two will lead
the leader that is always the man
leads with his left
that is set in stone
Ladies respond with their right
Ready
Bring your feet together
i am sorry
it is alright
from the top
next is the half turn
Watch how i do it
Ready
Left foot make a half turn then bring both together
Right foot half turn then together
now you try
no no no
Look how i do it
Left turn slow
Right turn slow
the fat gentleman can do it
Concentrate on your own steps please
Let's try it in pairs
half turns are initiated by the man
Ladies respond one step later and finish one step behind
Go back on the foot you lead with
from the top
Start on your left this goes back
Right foot in and turn
the same foot as you lead with
you can do it
Once more
Feet together
Good exercise is not it
yes i am exhausted
Give it our best shot
she sure is pretty
that is why you are here right
Private lessons that is the way
not that anything would come of it
you are better off in a class
she is all the sweeter when viewed from afar
if she hadn't split with her partner she'd be so busy competing she'd have no time to teach here
that old goat comes three days a week
Still hasn't noticed she loathes him
Sooner or later he will quit
Wonder how long you will last
the missus literally dragged me over to the local community center
a social dance circle
Taught by the local grocer
he is a real poseur but he has the old dears drooling
he is really not that good
i am taking these lessons secretly to surprise him and the missus
what is your name
Tanaka
what is your excuse
Sorry
i should not have asked a personal question
Doctor's advice
i am diabetic
Really
and so young too
it is good exercise
how about you
i also heard dancing's good for the health
that is what they all say
Am i the only one who is being honest
you look like a hot shot manager type
the old ducks in my dance circle would love you
Well time to go
where do you live
Maybe i can drop you off
i live in Oji
all the way from Oji
and you Mr Manager
i am no manager
i live out past Tokorozawa
that is miles away
Funny how we all travel so far ain't it
Best kept under wraps eh
they will think we are a bunch of dirty old lechers
before i go up the stairs at the school i always make sure no one's looking
Mr Sugiyama look up
Head up
is Dad home yet
not yet
he stays out late Wednesdays
that is good
You'd rather he was not here
you said he should go out and enjoy himself
Did i
but he does seem to be happier recently
that is good news
you were worrying that he was depressed
was i
yes you were
Wonder what cheered him up
that is enough
it is not your private dance floor
and i am sick of your one trick rumba
a cheap imitation of Donny Burns
how can we tango to this rumba
is not your time up anyway
Get lost
Go practice somewhere else
Shut up you fat frustrated old bag
what
Mr Aoki
what is going on
this is pathetic
you beg me to be your partner then you create a scene like this
i have never been so embarrassed
Get yourself a new partner
Letting this hysterical cow insult you
who are you calling a cow
and you copied my dress
Take yours back to the shop
it sure was a shock to see you standing there
i did not recognize you
Actually i was quite impressed
Five year's practice would make a dancer of anyone
Five years
i had no idea
i keep it well hidden
everyone gets the idea that you are strange
Especially since i am still single
of course they think i am just after girls
but when i finish work put on the clothes the wig and become Donny Burns
Latin world champion and i start to move to the rhythm
i am so happy so completely free
you know how it is for me at work
but i blew it again
i take part in amateur dance competitions
J a D a organizes them that is the Japan Amateur Dance Association
i am at the third level
but i still can not find a good partner
i met that last one on a dance tour to England
yes to watch the competitions
she had no partner either so we teamed up
she was so young and pretty single too
it was a good chance
that fat old bag ruined it
she is probably rich and has nothing to do but dance
Why did you start dancing
Well
i do not get much exercise recently
and i heard it is good for health
that is what they all say
Keep it secret
Imagine what they'd say at the office
yes of course
you could come to one of our dances
no thanks
i have barely begun
Doesn't matter
you look great
Better than me
it is easier if you go with someone
more women than men so every man's a prize
are not you here to dance
no point standing around
i will teach you
Let's dance
be a man
Dance with me
would you be so kind as to dance with me
Thank you
are you alright
i am sorry
do not worry
Listen to the music
Start on the second beat
okay
two three four
i am sorry
are you alright
if you will excuse me
he is acting weird
Miwa Co
Private Investigations
Excuse me
we offer free consultation
it is very discreet
Maybe we can help
he comes home late on Wednesdays and goes out on weekends
on these days his shirts always smell of perfume
Wednesday it is the same scent
on weekends it is mixed
he is seen making strange body movements
besides that it is a woman's intuition
Did you think of asking him
yes many times but
but what
i am afraid to
he is so straight
if it is another woman it will be more than just casual
and if he is having an affair
i have never even considered it
he might be caught up in something weird
but if it is an affair i am afraid to think i might lose him
an investigation will cost at least 500 000 yen
that is usually sufficient to gather evidence for a trial
Assuming we are talking about divorce
but we are not really sure it is an affair
you are right
in your husband's case there is no history of adultery and if it is enough to establish he is not mixing with some strange group then how about this
we will budget three days
if it takes less we will give a refund
Why not
i am not opposed to you appearing
but you want him only because he is the best
that is not reason enough to choose a partner
yes it is
i am a top class dancer too
you just want to spite your previous partner
Ever wonder why he left you
he betrayed me
i was dancing well
his mistake caused that accident
he did not ever try to cover for me
you still think so
it is not a partner's skill you are lacking
it is your dancing
Why can not you understand
how can i
you force me to teach these clods in the barn
is that my lesson
you yourself learnt on this very same dance foor
Starting this school was our dream
i am working
i am giving lessons
Why can not i get a new partner
Why can not i dance at recitals
Come in
Tamako sensi called to cancel today's lessons
i see
Sorry to interrupt
Re schedule your private lesons and take tonight's group lessons
Lucky boy
Tonight she is in your arms at last
any preferences
how about the waltz
Mr Sugiyama
yes
Why not
then let's practice the waltz
i will take you through the steps you have learned
Mr Sugiyama you first
are you really a reporter
not just chasing after her like everyone else
no not me
i am working
Really
can you dance
Wish i could but i have never had the chance
C'mon let's try
i will be the lead
i am on duty
Give it a try
he takes dance lessons every Wednesday
so he is involved in something strange
his instructor is a middle aged woman
Tonight's substitute was quite pretty
i would'n mind dancing with her myself
Getting around like this
you are kidding
Dancing doesn't suit the Japanese body
Guess he is just another dirty old man
that substitute is looking for a partner
he is certainly aiming hight
Sensei
what is it
Thank you for today's lesson
not at all
i am not as experienced as Tamako sensei
no no you were very good
i was impressed
Thank you
no
i thank you
i thought I'd go and eat
i haven't had dinner yet
but eating alone spoils the taste
if you haven't eaten perhaps we
i am sorry
i prefer not to have private contact with students
i see
Excuse me
one thing
this may seem rude but i hope you did not join the class with me as your goal
i take dancing very seriously
it is a classroom not a disco
do not dance if that is what you are after
every Wednesday your husband attends a ballroom dancing school
Presumably he is late Wed smelling of perfume because of the dancing lessons
one other point
on weekends he goes to dance with his classmates
the weekend perfumes you noticed are from dancing with the various women there
our brief was not to prove adultery so it is too early to make that conclusion
is this pretty lady his teacher
his regular teacher is a more mature woman
that lass is a substitute teacher
i have never seen him this happy
Personally i do not think your husband
is having a relationship whit her
what makes you think so
Experience as a detective
but why dancing
him dancing
i can not believe it
Perhaps a woman on weekends
i can investigate further
you have nothing to worry about
we do not know why he started dancing
but the secrecy is surely because he is ashamed
Experience again
as a man yes
i suspect he will soon give up dancing
Why do you say that
a hunch
he will tire of it
i wonder
some hunch
you forgot this
Sorry i am so rushed
Busy as always
Thank you very much
i do not get it
it must be that substitute
Your improved posture will give you away
hello there
you are really improving
a compliment from you is praise indeed
you are conscious of every footstep
no not yet
but your posture is so good
is it really
it gets dangerous when it is second nature
is that right
Like golfers swinging their umbrellas at the train station
Think i will be practicing on the platform
that is hard to imagine
Well you'd be the last one to notice
Dance is that captivating
Maybe
i never thought I'd get in this deep
have you been to a dance hall
no not yet
it is a lot of fun
we should go sometime
You'd be the last to notice
that flasy guy is Jitterbug Hama
he is a dance hall regular
those sitting over there are waiting to be asked to dance
you can hire a pro from the counter over there
Ms Ishizaka your partner awaits you
Enjoy yourself i will be dancing with Marika
is that you Mr Sugiyama
Ms Tamako
what are you doing here
that is my line
i work here part time
i am alone so i have nothing to do on days off
i moonlight here to keep dancing
on your own
no i am with Aoki
she is very pretty
who is she
his new partner
they entered the Eastern Dancing
Eastern Amateur Dance Gala
yes that is it
he insists on dancing with such young girls
Hope he is not dumped again
he should dance with Toyoko
she is also looking for a partner
how about you
not in competition no way
is not she fantastic
Aoki is very much a Latin man
he won't dance anything but Latin
may i have this dance
Hang on a minute
if that is okay with you
shall i introduce you to someone
if you do not mind I'd prefer to dance with you
how sweet
but do not feel obliged
Try someone else perhaps
it is not that
some of my steps still need work
so earnest
here you can forget the steps and enjoy yourself
that is Joe Blues over there
they say he can make your backbone melt
this tune
Remember the King and i
that bald actor
Yul Brynner
it was that film which started me dancing
it still sets my heart racing
he held Deborah Kerr's hands like
Dance is more than just the steps
Feel the music and just dance for sheer joy
Watch it
Sorry
Forgive us
oh it is you
be careful
you have got nerve you are hopeless
you forced me
i said i could not
sometimes the worst dressed dance best
like good dancers who say they can not
Toyoko please
Tamako sensei
Come see this
is not that Mr Kimoto
yes
i hear he is going to give a demonstration
what is happening
he is a dance instructor an all Japan finalist
he suddenly split with his partner
Look is not that Mai
so the rumor is true
Rumor
you know breaking up with her partner
Did she
you should know you are the one who likes her
they did great at Blackpool then suddenly split up
Blackpool the top world competition
do not you even know that
some say that Kimoto and Mai fell in love and engineered the break ups to get together
Interesting place is not it
you are suggesting we dance here
is not that why you are defying your father
but why here
it is not like we have to dance among them
we needed a place for our debut and the owner kindly offered us this anniversary event
but this is not ballroom dancing
Lounge lizards and showgirls
what is wrong with that
they are having a wonderful time
Doesn't their dancing thrill you fill you with inspiration
Blackpool has a history but in its own way so does this dance floor
so there is no hope then
Why should i a Blackpool semi finalist dance in a dump like this
Am i right
is this some kind of test
it was not intended to be but it is now
so i must have failed
i can not dance here
that is a shame
Good luck finding someone
you too
you should lighten up and enjoy your dancing
it is more than just competition
i am not suggesting we go to a hotel
it is a short cut
i thought maybe we could become partners
but our styles are too different
no couple gets it right away
we need practice
no that is not it
when we are talking like this you are fine
but it is so creepy
Your dancing it gives me the creeps
Mr Sugiyama
not here yet
you will do
be my partner for a minute
Good evening
what is this
Looks like Tanaka's being auditioned as a partner
she is determined to move up to the next level
they say men take three times longer to learn than women
Stop
Control yourself
Slobbering like that
Your hands are dripping wet
you are making me sick
there is no way you are becoming my partner
you dragged him out there
Shut up short ass
that is rude
you should watch what you say
Fussy little man with your fussy little steps
you want to talk about my steps
what about them
Go on share your wisdom
do i really make you sick
Am i really that disgusting
the first girl i ever liked said that
and i was not even dancing
my doctor recommended dancing as exercise
first i was embarrassed
but soon all my cares were gone
like being drunk
my heart singing
Fireworks exploding in my head
all my worries forgotten and i began to love dance
but i suppose even when i am dancing
do i really look that bad
no of course not
i am sorry
i did not mean it like that
Forgive me
Toyoko
this is the third time she is collapsed from overwork
this is Toyoko's daughter
Sorry for all this trouble
you must be Mr Sugiyama
yes
she tells me everything
Said you were elegant a little like my late father
she seemed sad to hear you had a family
i hope she was not too pushy
she is under such pressure lately
she can not find a partner
the last one insulted her dancing
she is desperate to enter the competition
she works hard at two jobs
and helps out a friend's restaurant
every night she is out dancing
no wonder she collapsed
how long has she been widowed
as far back as i can remember
she gave up dancing to concentrate on raising me
she first met him at a company dance party
it is by far her favorite memory of him
she is always telling that story
she regrets i missed seeing him waltz
but Japonese ballroom dancing is pityful
Sorry i souldn't have said that
Why do not you be Toyoko's partner
no I'd be terrible
You'd be okay
i guarantee it
She'd never agree
my dancing is far too bad
she will be fine
you heard what her daughter said
she is quite fond of you
and dance begins with the dancer's feelings
besides you are not a bad dancer
Spare me just two hours three times a week after class
two hours
i won't charge you
Special training
there is still three months before the competition
we will be able to do it
is not that right Mai
you look fit as a fiddle
i am full of energy and raring to go
you are a brave man or you have got strange tastes
Look i do not know what my daughter said to you
but i do not want sympathy okay
Stop being so defensive
he agreed because Mai asked him to do it
you hardly need sympathy
i guessed as much
Ready
Let's begin
we will need to do the waltz and the quick step
Plus the rumba and paso doble
Dance them in that order
first the waltz
Wait
if you do not lead this is hopeless
we haven't covered that yet
you have got to be joking
and you want to be my partner
that is enough
he is already under pressure
do not make it worse
Bear her no mind
i just wanted to see you two paired
we will stick to modern today
Everyone's worried about you
you do not come to practice
me too i have
i have ended up in the competition
and with that Toyoko Takahashi too
Once more
Good night everyone
if you will excuse me
Good evening
hello again
Glad you came
what about trying Mr Aoki for the Latin program
you must be joking
Give me Sugiyama any day
but i was watching his rumba the other day
it still needs a lot of work
i am not saying he can not do it but his Latin will take time to improve
both may be a bit too much
i was going to ask you if we could stick to just one when Mr Aoki happened to call
there is someone he must beat in this competition
and Mr Aoki is after all a Latin man
so if Toyoko will do
i mean seeing that you two haven't always gotten along so well
Teaming with me to get revenge
must be a big deal
do not tell me that latest little bimbo up and left you again
Trash your style did she
yes she did
she insulted me
Said my dancing made her sick
are you busy tonight
not particularly
would you mind taking Mr Sugiyama
i want to watch these two
do not hesitate
Really put that right foot out
Ready
Once more from the top
that first step is so important
you are still hesitating
the leader must commit his whole body to convey to his partner the tone of the entire dance
a weak first step transmits nothing
this is how you did it
See how it says nothing
be confident you must stride
it is most important that your own right side remains firmly up against your partner
Feel that
shall we
that is not it
Take a bigger stride
yes
that is more like it
now let's try it with Toyoko
Watch them Mai
Wait for her to come
then take her firmly
do you see
the judges watch from the minute you start
do not hold back
you are already hesitant
Pull her in closer
Take a big stride with the right
Toyoko will you stop that
but he is stiff as a board
i am terribly sorry
not that
here from the heart
will you both try to be serious
we are serious are not we
would you consider tutoring them for the competition
Wait for her to come to you
Look left
is he okay
i will call an ambulance
to win you need to stand out and to dance well
with anywhere up to ten couples on the floor at once you are lucky to get ten seconds from the judges
this is the quick step format
you enter from here
with an initial sweep past the crowd
Alternating scissors
then a side chass change direction
to a running finish and natural turn
is not it exciting
the waltz usually begins facing outward and starts with a half turn
leaving the middle wide open
so take center stage and do something unusual
Even if they hate it the judges will be watching
are you alright
Let's take a break
Mr Sugiyama's exhausted
no i am fine
i am beat too
i will get drinks
i will go
it is okay
Mineral water for you Chinese tea for him
Thanks
Sorry i am getting carried away
no need to apologize
at my age it is embarrassing to say so but every day i feel so alive
Even being tired feels great
it is been a long time since i felt this enthusiastic
it is a good feeling
Lately i have begun to think about Blackpool again
Up until just recently
i haven't wanted to
Blackpool is a small seaside resort town
Normally it is very quiet
but that completely changes for the championship week
i first went to Blackpool when i was five
the central ballroom was so big and so splendid
i joined all those strangers imitating their steps
i will never forget the finals at the Winter Garden
Particularly one young couple
they lost in the semi finals
they had the most enchanting quick step routine
but just at the end they collided with another couple
he fell heavily and ended up in the hospital
but both my parents were tremendously impressed
i asked why
Father explained that to the end he tried to protect his partner
since that first day in Blackpool dance has become my entire world
what started me dancing was you gazing out of the window like that
you can see that window from the trains
every day on the train home i looked for you
when i saw you somehow i felt relieved or disappointed if you weren't there
Your melancholy look
it totally charmed me
i married at age 28
had a child by 30
at 40 i bought the home i longed for
i have worked so hard for these things
i thought it was a happy life
but after i bought the house something changed
it is no reflection on my wife or on my love for my daughter
but something was different
i need to work to pay the mortgage
i accepted that but something was still missing
then you appeared
Looking up and seeing you there made me want just one time to dance with you
Even after
i was very rude to you you stuck with dancing
i really felt like giving up
but if i had
i would have been everything you accused me of
of course it is true that affection for you was what brought me to the class
but to be confronted with it was a shock
i thought she did not have to be like that
i wanted to prove to you that it was not because of you
I'd said i was here to dance
but
but what
no sooner did i decide to continue than i really began to like it
i was watching you too
from the window here
i saw you practicing on the platform
it warmed my heart
i will never forget it
it is just not fair
Selfish man
Eastern Japan Amateur Dance Competition
here we go
Mr Sugiyama you look so serious
Relax a little
Ready
Cheese
how come you are here
Inspired by our enthusiasm
this is the missus
do not be so rude
this is my niece
the wife roped her in too
Tanaka wanted a partner
they dance great together
Mr Sugiyama
that suits you
my late husband's best tails
you deserve a medal for putting up with her
Enough from you
Go and save seats for us
the first round will be the rumba
Number 1 09
Number 1 1 0
1 1 4
1 1 6
Mr Aoki looks like he is going for it
Fussing with your hair
our routine was crap
they deliberately messed with it
Take the damn thing off and dance
you would not understand
Bald creeps are not my specialty
Alright then
Let's get rid of it
Mr Aoki's fantastic
he cast off more than just the wig
Mom
they are announcing finalists
i am coming
Numbers 1 01 1 03 1 06 1 09
1 1 0
1 1 4
1 1 5
1 21
i thought Mr Macho was pretty good
Bad attitude
Ungentlemanly behavior
it is a British sport after all
he will be too nervous even to hear the music
you must guide him
Leave it to me
Mr Sugiyama
we are on
Mr Sugiyama just flow with the music and enjoy the dance
first round
the waltz
here they are
but they look nervous
no over there
Did you arrange this
i had no choice
it is easiest if she sees for herself
she is headed for a breakdown
you are a detective not a marriage counselor
you are not even billing her
there is Dad
the start is everything
Take a deep breath
now
they did it
Points lost there
but who is fault is it
that is why i do not like amateurs
can not keep from bumping into others or being bumped themselves
how you react is most important
Judges naturally notice bumping
but a quick recovery and a calm return to dancing on the contrary can be noted and scored pretty highly
you are hooked are not you
C'mon Dad
so close and he doesn't notice us
is your daughter here
i hardly think so
i could be mistaken but i am sure i heard a girl call out
C'mon Dad just as we began
and now for the quick step
Well done
he is great
he is doing well
Told you
Dad
Watch out
you knew
yes
for a long time
but i was afraid to talk about it
i kept thinking you'd tell me
but you did not say a word
at first i thought it was an affair
it was a relief to find out it was not
but i still could not understand why
it brought you to life
i felt completely on my own
Today when i saw you it was even harder to understand
it hurts so much
Even if it was dancing it was still an affair
it was not just an affair
i was seriously involved
Until today
Until today
yes
i have finished with dance
Why
because of me
it will be all my fault
no not at all
it is just not for me that is all
Hey look at this
it will blow you away
what is it
you won't believe your eyes
is that Aoki
Read this part
after suddenly doffing his trademark wig Donny Aoki swept the floor before unexpectedly defaulting
Donny Aoki
that bald jerk
Ballroom dancing of all things
you can just imagine that dirty pervert
there is nothing wrong with it
if you have never danced you should watch what you say
hi there
hello
i hope you did not quit dancing because of me
i really do not care let's dance again
you were dancing really well
you did so well in just a year do not throw it away
it is not that
i have just had enough of dancing
i began on a whim
you saw the results
i am sorry for disturbing you more dedicated dancers
Please forgive me
Forget all that
it doesn't matter
Maybe you have a lot on your mind
but if you want to dance call me
i won't stand for you dancing with anyone else
Mai is going to England
we are having a farewell party next Friday
Please join us
Mai would be pleased
this is a letter from her
Thank you so much
Please do not laugh at me for saying this but i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart
in the competition you danced superbly
you did your utmost to protect Toyoko
she is fully aware of that
we all know you did your very best
and that is why Toyoko put her trust in you
she really does want to dance with you again
Remember i once told you about Blackpool
i did not tell you about my failure there
that is because i never really faced up to it myself
but now i can tell you about it
two years ago when we finally arrived there
i was realizing a dream so thrilled just to be there
I'd sacrificed everything for competition
i had an excess of self confidence
the audience's support for us was overwhelming
we made it to the semi finals
i rode on the waves of applause and cheering
i was thrilled and moved and i danced my best ever
and then just like you we collided during the quick step
i blamed my partner
Why did not he protect me
his reaction stunned me
he wanted us to break up
Even if we did go on to win he wanted us to split after the competition
i couldn'y understand
we were both aiming for the top
Why did he betray me
Soon after i returned to Japan
i wanted to show him up so i looked for a top class dancer
but my father would not let me take a new partner
he had me teach at his school
he never wanted me to teach but he made sure i did
i did not understand why
i was so unhappy reluctantly teaching
then you arrived at the school
during the months we practiced for the competition something began to change within me
i came to realize that i had always danced alone never fully trusting my partner
my failure at Blackpool was not his fault
it was a natural result of me dancing only for myself
it was you who taught me the splendor of dance when you trust and enjoy
i decided to start again from the beginning
so thank you very much
i am looking forward to seeing you at the party
Going to the party
she is going to England right
Seems you know everything
i owe you an apology
i hired a private detective
i was afraid to ask you
you have always been so serious
and because i love you
Please go and dance with her tomorrow
Continue your dancing
I'd rather you were full of life than see you look so down
Teach me to dance too
Dance with me the way you would with her
will you be quiet
i quit dancing
Why not dance with Mom
do it
Dance with each other
you were wonderful
Please dance for me
when i move my left go back on your right
if it is my right then it is your left
we turn 90 degrees to the right and bring our feet together
Back on my left you come right
my right your left
as you turn 90 degrees bring both legs together
Alright once more
i am sorry that i made you feel so lonely
Going shopping later with Chikage
See you after the party
Love Masako
where is Sugiyama
he is already left
he has
is Sugiyama here yet
not yet
that is strange
he is already left work
Look at Hattori showing off
Go dance when the rumba starts
Sitting waiting is not going to bring him here
Maybe he is not coming
shall we dance Mr Sugiyama

Written Directed by Masayuki SUOPope Innocent Vill
in nomine Patris et Filii comprised of ambitious men sons of Rome's ruling families
Orsini dog
Colonna whore
the Pope's most powerful advisor is Vice Chancellor
Rodrigo Borgia
i have not given up my hope of a Borgia on the Spanish throne
i ask Your Holiness to replace me as Bishop of Valencia with my sainted nephew Cesare
there is a question of Cesare's dubious birth
no Spaniard no Borgia bastard will ever again be Pope
he draws support from his married lover Giulia Farnese
Why are you so good at this
and his family
Juan
and Rodrigo has even greater plans for me
Cesare
but i do not want to be a priest
i do not have the soul for it
and Lucrezia
who will arrange a marriage for me
Cardinal Borgia your uncle
Still Rodrigo is determined that none shall forget the name
i have this sense of foreboding
that i will soon die
you will not die soon
but five will die before the summer heat cools
Deaths that will change you
who is going to die
that i cannot say
Tell me
no
i have not the power
you are Bishop yet you ignore Church dogma
Pope Innocent
Pray for us
what are you doing
Cesare he has the fever do not touch him
Use this to see a doctor not for wine
Pope Innocent has condemned witchcraft and all Christians who associate with witches
besides you make us late for your uncle's banquet
a toast
a toast to our guest of honor our newest Cardinal Giovanni de Medici
Giovanni de Medici
between the Borgia the Cibo the Medici and the Orsini families
by marriage by blood we are all one family
Salute
Salute
and i toast my dear sister Clarice who is in Heaven celebrating the elevation of her son Giovanni
as she also celebrates her daughter Maddalena's marriage to Franceschetto Cibo
Bravo
Maddalena how is it having the Pope as your father in law
Tell us in Florence are women allowed to eat with men
no
Well when i am Countess of Oliva
i will insist that i sit at the same table as my husband
uh about that
Your betrothal to Cherubin de Centelles has been nulled
oh no
he does not want me
Your uncle has made a better match
Don Gaspare de Procida
Son of the Count of Almenara and Aversa
twice as handsome and twice as rich
oh my God
she has the fever
Friends
Dear friends
as many of you know Papa has taken ill exhausted from working day into night keeping the peace between Naples and Milan
Wait in the library
i toast my father Lorenzo the Magnificent
Lorenzo
a song
Written by Lorenzo
the civil war which has raged throughout the Turkish Empire is over
Bajazet has defeated his brother Djem
a united Muslim army means those heathens will once again attack Italy
yes but according to this report after Djem was defeated he surrendered to the Knights of Rhodes
Ironic huh
a Muslim feeling safer with a Christian than his own kin
what do the Knights intend to do with the Shahzadeh
Hold Djem at our fortress in Auvergne
until such time as a new Crusade is launched
Djem hidden away in the hinterlands of France
Wise
Hardly wise Brother
Keeping him out of public view diminishes his usefulness
instead he should reside here in the Eternal City
the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil
he shall preserve thy soul
God will protect us
we stand before you Lord here where so many pontiffs rest in eternal peace aware more than ever of our own mortality
we are all going to die
we are all going to die
his Royal Highness the Shahzadeh Djem
Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Church i have brought a gift
People of Faith i give you the Lance of Longinus the very blade that pierced the chest of our Savior Jesus Christ
the Holy Lance
the Holy Lance
my name will be carved in history
Thank you Rodrigo
i do not bite
Come in
i asked to see you the nephews of my benefactor Cardinal Borgia because as a stranger in your city i thought you could be my guides
and perhaps even my friends
Join me
no
Thank you
i am on a fast
Hmm
a health precaution
a penance
Well i am in search of a sin for which to be penitent so
this fabric from Milan is absolutely gorgeous
Lucrezia you cannot wear Milanese cloth the first time you are presented to your fiance
Don Gaspare de Procida is cousin to King Ferrante of Naples and given the current tension between Naples and Milan a dress made from that material would cause a war
Show us another
do you constantly disagree with me out of malice or mere habit
Lucrezia
Your brother Goffredo is here with a message which he will speak only to your ears
Goffredo
Goffredo
how are you
how is Mother
Boiling with fever and begs you come at once
Absolutely not
Lucrezia is busy preparing to meet her future husband
i have been denied the sight of Mother since moving to the Cancelleria
if she is fevered i must run to her
we have only just cleansed this house
you shan't expose yourself to more ill humors
but Adriana the link between mother and daughter is sacred
if my mama were dying i would fight the Devil himself to be by her side
you see i am not so disagreeable
you encourage me knowing that such a visit would enrage my uncle
i am sorry
Tell Mama i cannot
i will not visit her
Mama will die
Goffy
Cultivate this friendship with Djem
it will frustrate della Rovere
Eminence word from Florence
Lorenzo de Medici has succumbed to the fever
the first death
are the streets of Florence quiet
so far
where is Giovanni
he is here in the study
i knew how infirm Papa was
i should have stayed by his side
he wanted you in Rome doing God's work as he did his entire life
i will go say Mass to pray for his soul and pray as well that peace within the Italian states will not perish with Lorenzo
may God bless you and your brothers Giovanni
Grieve my friend
there is no shame in a broken heart
Just before my father died the monk Savonarola refused to grant him absolution
the thought of Papa burning in Hell until the end of time
a monk cannot condemn a man
Only God can
God is just
he will open his arms to Lorenzo and say
you made Florence a paradise on Earth
Come dear one and rest
we must forget our priestly intentions for tonight and celebrate the genius of your father's living
Sweet love of Jesus
we should have gone with Giovanni to Florence for his father's funeral
he did not want us
you mean he did not want me
i will be honest Rome casts a strange spell upon you
not Rome
Wherever i am
there is always two elements struggling within me
Beast versus Archangel
more often than not the beast wins
a beast has no soul
you do
my soul is empty
Alessandro i have a confession to make
to me
have you forgotten
i like you am not yet a priest
no but you are a drunkard and will therefore keep my confidence
more likely i will simply forget
so speak freely
i am consumed by the fever of envy
my brother
our friend de Medici
their lives are in motion
mine is as stagnant as the garbage in Montesarchio
you are Bishop of Valencia
but that is not enough
i yearn for what Juan has
his dukedom
or Rodrigo's affection
both
more
something else
what does Professor Decio teach
Unlike lust but much like gluttony envy becomes a sin only if you act upon the impulse
but how can i not be envious
Juan will achieve greatness in his life
so will you
by a different route
Cesare contemplate the other side of your instincts
you comfort the sick the afflicted
when your emotions are in check your presence is calming nurturing spiritual
Regardless of your desires perhaps you are a priest
and if your soul is empty replenish it
Make restitution to those you have sinned against
Marcantonio we must talk
Fucking turd
Remove yourself from Colonna property or i will put the next one through your skull
Marcantonio i have wronged you
Forgive me for my wretched sins
who can forgive sins but God alone
Am i correct priest
Run or die
i am ready to die
if my dying ends the feud between the Colonna and the Borgia then go ahead and kill me
Enjoy your freedom Catalan for when Pope Innocent lies in his tomb your entire family shall be shackled to the walls of the lowest darkest dungeon inside Castel Sant'Angelo
so much for replenishing my soul
Madonna i bring you some small tokens of my deep affection
Pearls from the sea
Gold from the mountains
Perfume from the air
and yet i see that all the elements pale beside your loveliness
Brother we must talk
Hurry this is important
yes Juan
i am sure you are on a mission of utmost urgency
there
Christoforo Castanea Count of Castel Leone
last night he had a secret meeting with Mustafa Pasha
an impoverished count shares a drink with the Turkish ambassador
so
Padishah Bajazet is offering 300 000 ducats to the man who kills his brother
Castanea has a title but no property
i believe he plots to assassinate Djem
you will help me discover the truth foil the conspiracy
since when have you been interested in Turkish politics
or the truth
Cesare i know your value even if our uncle does not
Together we can triumph
Rodrigo will bless us both
Djem is more valuable to Rome and to us Borgia alive
then quickly devise a plan
Simple
we must befriend Castanea
when Innocent expires we fear the next pope will bellyache for another Crusade
and use Djem as a rallying point against Bajazet
we Borgia would do anything to keep Djem from gaining power
that is why we have him under lock and key
Worry not
Go on
Go
Why do you say worry not
the Padishah has hired me to
Dispose of his brother
Excellent
how
i am to poison the well which supplies the water to the Apostolic Palace
Poison the well
but then would you not also be poisoning the Pope and all the clerics who live and work there
his Holiness is almost dead anyway
as for the rest good riddance
Good riddance indeed
the hour is late
no
the room belongs to you
you have already paid for
we pay nothing
our mother owns this inn
Thank you
for everything
the ale the women the friendship
Christoforo we thank you doubly for taking us into your confidence
we know that your fortunes are low but no nobleman should be without a valet
our man Rudolfo will serve you till the end of your days
for what reason could you possibly be wearing that frown
Well go on
were the flowers not to your satisfaction
the wine not to your taste
Don Gaspare
his demeanor his arrogance
his interest in me is purely as a mirror of himself
Boys mature more slowly than girls
but i am now a woman and i want a real man not a preening child
i refuse to wed Don Gaspare
Silly girl you must
the documents have been signed by your uncle
i will not be forced into wedlock with that self loving peacock
i am a Borgia
i deserve better
no
you deserve whatever blessing his Eminence gives you
that is not the face of La Bella
that is the face of Hell
Your niece
she refuses to marry Don Gaspare
for what reason
she finds him undesirable and demands a more handsome husband
Don Gaspare is one of the finest looking young men in Europe
more importantly this match has been sanctioned by King Ferdinand of Spain
my love i do not have time for trivialities
Please solve this problem
Use your wiles to convince the girl
Beg pardon Your Eminence
Word from the Vatican
his Holiness is mere hours from death
the fever accelerates
as do the pains in his abdomen
an old scar on his right leg has broken open
i have done all i can
i have heated the room sealed the windows to sweat the fever out
there is no hope
you are absolutely certain
when Innocent dies the peasants will go on a rampage
shall we fortify our palace
Definitely
Whichever cardinal controls the treasury controls whichever cardinal sits next on Saint Peter's throne
if Orsini does then Borgia does
Orsini must double the Papal Guard at Castel Sant'Angelo
no
it would be better to have our own men in place
we must also station our Bravia around the Vatican
Tell Juan to arm the consigliere and move Djem to the secret room above the Sistine
i want a shooter on every window
you take five men to the roof
i am in charge brother
Go Goddamn you now
yes sir
she says i carry myself with an air of importance
of course i do
i am a de Procida
i shall rule Almenara and Aversa one day
yes but do you wish to share your throne with a woman who abhors you
as my mother does my father
a romantic gesture will warm Lucrezia's heart
i gave her pearls gold
Wealth is not romance
Romance is for fools and poets
Romance is the precursor of seduction
have you yet tasted a woman
i assure you Lucrezia is ready to become one
but a woman needs romance a woman craves seduction
for the sake of your own desires woo her
Lessen your swagger and you will find yourself with ample reason to swagger
you are to go to the chapel at once
no
Forgive the intrusion
the city is in turmoil yet i could not stop thinking about you
no this is improper
Please only one moment signora the length of a heartbeat
Until the wondrous day when i may kiss your lips
we must defend this wall here
this wall is more
Look who i found skulking about
Cricket what brings you here
you two must come
Mama is dying
we cannot both go not now
Look our defenses are in place
there is naught to do but wait and you are more the healer than i
when Castanea makes his move against Djem you will let me know
of course
do you want me to come with you
no
Make sure the Bravia on the roof are not drunk
we bequeath the 148 000 ducats in the papal treasury
to our beloved son Franceschetto
we bestow unto Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere the keys to the Castel Sant'Angelo
my dear brothers i beseech you all to elect someone better than me
as my successor
Signed Innocent Vill of that name July 19th
1492
July the 19th
he changed his will five days ago
what difference does that make
for the past five days he has barely known his own name
there are witnesses that will confirm his healthy state of mind
i for one
if we do what Innocent asks the papal treasury will be depleted
he begs us to elect someone better than him yet does not leave the poor soul a single ducat
Borgia is already imagining himself wearing the tiara
there will be no money for whoever is next you fishmonger
be silent Catalan
you want the Castel Sant'Angelo ruled by this Genoan sodomite
Giuliano
Stop it
what is this
such behavior in the presence of the Pope
Desist
each of you has benefited from my father's reign
if a man's last request is sacred then a Pope's must be doubly so
if della Rovere takes possession of Castel Sant'Angelo we Borgia are doomed
we must keep Innocent alive until this will is broken
and we must secure the papal treasury
how
by moving the gold and silver from the Castel Sant'Angelo to a secret location
you spoke to Lucrezia
she refused
yes
Excellency help me
Mama
Cesare save my family
you need fresh air
has the doctor
they say we are too far gone
where is Lucrezia
she will be here soon
Rodrigo
Goffy i need you to fetch someone
yes sir
i do not wish to impose but you sit alone as if lost
we have had our disagreements but the difference in our ages is not great
and more importantly i know the joy and yes fear of a wedding engagement
i am lost
at first i found Don Gaspare repulsive
with his head held so high i thought he might topple backwards
but now part of me is taken by him
but i am so ugly how can Don Gaspare possibly be proud that i will be his wife
no
he agreed to marry me solely for my dowry
Nonsense
you are a beauty in the making
and we women though we have no rights or privileges can use for high purpose our virginity and later our sexuality
oh Lord what a thing to say
are you shocked because you have never heard such words or do you pretend to be shocked because you know deep in your heart that i speak true
Perhaps we shall be friends
Papa food will restore you
what can we do Dottore
i have a way to nourish his Holiness
what better cure than mother's milk
Castanea he is on his way to the Vatican
yes
i will go tell your brother
no
i will take care of Castanea myself
Signor help me
there will be a place for you by my side in Heaven
Grazie
Grazie
if i save your family Excellency you must swear that you will use your influence with the Pope to lift the ban on witchcraft which is not Devil worship but natural God given remedies
yes yes i will speak to his Holiness
but if my family dies you will die as well
Juan
no
Judas
we are a planet of Judases
i have hired a doctor an expert in the latest medical methods
a Jew
a Jew inside the Vatican
Borgia this is a sacrilege
Whatever can be done must be done
what in the name of the risen Christ are you doing
Curing your family
Excreta
from swine
you are covering my mother in shit
you ignorant cunt
my family should be treated with potable gold with aqua regia ambergris not the feces of pigs
if your high brow cures work why send for me
Excreta pulls the toxin out and has many other healing powers
i myself bathe weekly in shit and my skin is flawless
you will cure them witch or i will feed you to pigs
there you are one ducat each for the use of your son's blood
no
no
God have mercy on me
no i do not think he will
down here you are as far away from God's mercy as any man can be
but you may yet be blessed by Borgia mercy if you reveal who else is involved in this conspiracy
Please
Let me go
Let me go Juan
Give me a name
Juan
Juan
Juan
Juan
Juan
Juan let me go
Give me a name
Juan
Juan
Tell me who is involved
i will
i will
Come back i will
all three boys are dead
but did the cure work
oh well
Pay the Jew in full
Guardian of our souls and bodies healer of the sick helper of those in their agony pray for us
Saint Michael the Archangel guardian of our souls and bodies healer of the sick helper of those in
Cesare
Mama
Goffredo
the fever has been broken
Thanks be to God
and to you
you have worked a miracle Cesare
Miracles are myths
this was the magic of science
Ottaviano
Brother
Why will Ottaviano not wake
the second death
no
no
i beg you
no
you were to cure all three
i warned you
Guards seize the witch
when you looked into the future did you see yourself as the third death
a curse on you
Eternal damnation
our Father who art in Heaven hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
Amen
Blessed Joseph patron of the dying
i recommend the soul of this faithful servant Pope Innocent in his agony that under thy protection he may be preserved from the wiles of the Devil and that he may be found worthy to enter everlasting joy
through the same Christ our Lord
Amen
Water
no thank you Eminence
Drink
i said no
no
Stop
Stop
Stop
the water is poisoned
now how would you know that
Old friend
Rise Franceschetto
such behavior is unbecoming for the son of a Pope
i beg you Juan save me
you must tell your uncle that i was working in secret with you to uncover the conspiracy pretending to join Mustafa Pasha and Castanea
of course
i would be happy to lie on your behalf
Especially if the 300 000 ducats you received from the Turkish ambassador found its way into the Borgia bank account
i will send the money over at once
and your father's previous will
Restored
may i go
Mmm
Franceschetto
there is one more insignificant item
Your wife
Maddalena de Medici
i will be away from my home tomorrow evening
Excellent
who knows Franceschetto your father may yet recover and then you can cut my throat
i want you there tomorrow to watch Castanea die
a terrible crime has been attempted on the Blessed Person of our Supreme Pontiff and a foreign prince who is a guest in our city
a crime made worse for the perpetrator conspired with the heathens who defile the name of Christ in the Holy Land
Let Christoforo Castanea be damned for an eternity
and Juan Borgia praised by all true believers
Die die die
Die die die
the fourth death
Witches
Heathens
this sickness is a curse which a witch has put on me
Destroy
Advocate where is the will
Destroy
no
no no stop you imbecile
Eminence
According to legend this lance gave supernatural power to Constantine the Great Justinian Charlemagne
the Colonna have placed their Bravi on the Ponte Adriano and move towards Ponte Sisto
we must depart at once or we will be trapped this side of the Tiber
Today is the anniversary of my brother's death
i am haunted by the thought of him dying alone in exile whilst i remained in Rome
how often will you torture yourself
if you had left the city you'd never have been allowed to return
i will not leave here now until i have seen that the Pope is dead
i am surrounded by flames
i am surrounded by flames
Surrounded by flames
Innocent Vill of that name Supreme Pontiff of the one true church the first among men the height and summit of the human race moribundus mortuus

Giovanni Battista Cibo
the fifth the final death
no not the final one
the peasants believing they as the children of God are the heirs to the wealth of their Holy Father will steal whatever they can
since Roman lust for plunder is never satisfied the mob will attack the palaces of every cardinal in Rome
Soon they will come here
as has been true since the beginning the value of a human life is worth far less than its weight in gold
we must departSubtitles

Mutation it is the key to our evolution
it has enabled us to evolve from a single celled organism into the dominant species on the planet
this process is slow and normally taking thousands and thousands of years
but every few hundred millennia evolution leaps forward

Woman Screaming

Well won't it be kind of cold
Well that is the point stupid
otherwise it would not be an adventure

Woman
Ladies and gentlemen we are now seeing the beginnings of another stage of human evolution
These mutations manifest at puberty and are often triggered by periods of heightened emotional stress
Thank you Ms Grey
it was quite educational
however it fails toad dress the issue that is the focus of this hearing
Three words
are mutants dangerous
i am afraid that is an unfair question Senator Kelly
after all the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous
Well we do license people to drive
yes but not to live
Senator it is a fact that mutants who have come forward and revealed themselves publicly have been met with fear hostility even violence
it is because of that ever present hostility that i am urging the Senate to vote against mutant registration
to force mutants to expose themselves will only further
Expose themselves
what is it the mutant community has to hide i wonder that makes them so afraid to identify themselves
i did not say they were hiding
Let me show you what is being hidden Ms Grey
i have here a list of names of identified mutants
living right here in the United States
Senator Kelly
now here is a girl in illinois who can walk through walls
now what is to stop her from walking into a bank vault or into the White House or into their houses
Senator Kelly
and there are even rumors Ms Grey of mutants so powerful that they can enter our minds and control our thoughts taking our God given free will
i think the American people deserve the right to decide whether they want their children to be in school with mutants to be taught by mutants
Ladies and gentlemen the truth is that mutants are very real and they are among us
we must know who they are Woman
that is right and above all we must know what they can do
Applause Continues

with nearly every invitation confirmed the event promises to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history
the leaders of over 200 nations will discuss issues ranging from the world's economic climate and weapons treaties to the mutant phenomenon and its impact on our world stage
many American legislators have contended that debate over mutant issues should be the primary focus of what is on the surface a strictly diplomatic affair

Hey no powers
to the public we are merely a school for gifted youngsters
Cyclops Storm and Jean were some of my first students
i protected them taught them to control their powers and in time teach others to do the same
the students are mostly run a ways
Frightened alone
some with gifts so extreme that they have become a danger to themselves and those around them
Like your friend Rogue
Incapable of physical human contact probably fort he rest of her life and yet here she is with others her own age
learning being accepted not feared
John
Sorry
i am Bobby
what is your name
Rogue
Logan's Voice
what will happen to her
Xavier
Well that is up to her
Rejoin the world as an educated young woman or stay on to teach others to become what the children have affectionately called X Men
Welcome to Mutant High
Xavier
but the school is merely a public face
the lower levels however are an entirely different matter
when i was a boy i discovered i had the power to control people's minds make them think or do whatever i wanted
when i was 17 i met a young man named Eric Lensherr
he too had an unusual power
he could create magnetic fields and control metal
Believing that humanity would never accept us he grew angry and vengeful
he became Magneto
there are mutants out there with incredible powers Logan and many who do not share my respect for mankind
if no one is equipped to oppose them humanity's days could be over
i will make a deal with you Logan
Give me 48 hours to find out what Magneto wants with you and i give you my word that i will use all my power to help you piece together what you have lost and what you are looking for
Crowd Cheering Shouting
Kelly
Senator listen you favor gun registration yes
Well some of these so called children possess more than ten times the destructive force of any handgun
no i do not see a difference
all i see are weapons in our schools
Well that is fair enough
all right
so
it is gonna be close
a vote this loaded is always close
what about the U N summit
the whole world will be watching
Maybe there is some way you could use that toy our advantage
we are Americans Henry
Let the rest of the damn world deal with mutants in their own way
you know this situation
These mutants
People like this Jean Grey
if it were up to me I'd lock'em all away
it is a war
it is the reason people like me exist
where the hell are we
Pilot
People like you are the reason i was afraid to go to school as a child
i am sorry
for what
if i hurt you
so could not wait to get my shirt off again huh
Jean
the metal is an alloy called adomatium
Supposedly indestructible
it is been surgically grafted to his entire skeleton
how could he have survived a procedure like that
his mutation
he has uncharted regenerative capability which enables him to heal rapidly
this also makes his age impossible to determine
he could very well be older than you Professor
Cyclops
who did this to him
he doesn't know
Nor does he remember anything about his life before it happened
Experimentation on mutants
Sighs
it is not unheard of
but i have never seen anything like this before
Cyclops
what do you think Magneto wants with him
i am not entirely sure it is him Magneto wants
Bird Cooing
Yech
Magneto
Toad has a wicked tongue Senator
Just like you
who are you people
where is Henry
Mr Guy rich has been dead for some time Senator
but i have had Mystique here keep you company
she takes so many shapes
Whatever you do to me you will make me right
every word i have spoken will be confirmed
are you a God fearing man Senator
that is such a strange phrase
i have always thought of God as a teacher as a bringer of light wisdom and understanding
you see i think what you really are afraid of is me
me and my kind
the Brotherhood of Mutants
though it is not so surprising really
Mankind has always feared what it doesn't understand
Well do not fear God Senator and certainly do not fear me
not anymore
what do you intend to do to me
Let's just say God works too slowly
i think you will be comfortable here
where is your room
with Scott down the hall
is that your gift
Putting up with that guy
Actually i am telekinetic
i can move things with my mind
Really
what kinds of things
all kinds of things
i also have some telepathic ability
what like your Professor
Nowhere near that powerful
but he is teaching me to develop it
i am sure he is
so read my mind
I'd rather not
Come on
you afraid you might like it
i doubt it
what do you see
Scott
Good night Logan
you gonna tell me to stay away from your girl
if i had to do that she would not be my girl
Hmm
Well then i guess you have got nothing to worry about do you Cyclops
yeah it must just burn you up that a boy like me saved your life huh
you ought to be careful
i might not be there next time
oh and Logan stay away from my girl stay away from my girl
Grunts
Door Opens
Mumbling
Logan
Logan
Logan wake up
Gasps Yells
Screams
Gasping
Help me
Somebody help
Scott grab a pillow
it was an accident
Xavier
Logan
what happened
is she all right
she will be all right
what did she do to me
Whenever Rogue touches someone she takes their energy their life force
in the case of mutants she absorbs their gifts for a short while
in your case your ability to heal
i feel like she almost killed me
if she'd held out any longer she could have
Door Opens
how are we feeling Senator
Advanced i hope
Hmm
what the hell have you done to me
Senator this is pointless
where would you go
who would take you in now that you are one of us
Yells
Growls
Tom my let it go
Tom my please let it go
i am telling Mommy
Boy
is that a mutant
Woman on TV
of this week's U N summit
with the leaders of over200nations attending the secret service has transformed Ellis Island into a veritable Fort Knox for tomorrow night's opening gala
Ellis Island rests less than one mile from the shores of Manhattan
Bobby
Rogue
Bobby
Rogue what did you do
they say that you are stealing other mutants' powers
no no
i borrowed his powers
you never use your power against another mutant
i had no choice
no you have to understand me
if i were you
I'd get myself out of here
what do you mean
Listen the students are freaked
Professor Xavier's furious
i do not know what he will do with you
i think it will be easier on your own
you should go
Xavier
what are you looking for Eric
it is strange
there are more powerful mutants out there
Why should this one be so important to him
Maybe it is his way with people
you do not like him
how could you tell
Well i am psychic you know
where is she
who
Rogue
she is gone
Woman's Voice
Welcome Professor
Welcome to Cerebro
this certainly is a big round room
the brain waves of mutants are different from average human beings
this device amplifies my power allowing me to locate mutants across great distances
that is how i intend to find Rogue
Why do not you just use it to find Magneto
i have been trying
but he seems to have found some way to shield himself from it
how would he know how to do that
because he helped me build it
now if you will excuse me
have you ever
Used Cerebro
no
it takes a degree of control and uh for someone like me it is
Dangerous
Telepathic Voices Low Distinct
Man over P a
now boarding on track four
she is at the train station
Logan
where is it
a few miles west of here
Logan you can not leave the mansion
it is just the opportunity Magneto needs
i am the reason she took off
we had a deal
she is all right
she is just upset
Storm Cyclops find her
See if you can talk to her
what
where is my motorcycle
Logan
Hey kid
i am sorry about last night
me too
you running again
i heard the professor was mad at me
Well who told you that
a boy at school
when is the last time you saw her
she was supposed to meet me for lunch
you look around
i will check with the ticket agent
Welcome Professor
you think i should go back
no i think you should follow your instincts
the first boy i ever kissed ended up in a coma for three weeks
i can still feel him inside my head
and it is the same with you
there is not many people that will understand what you are going through but i think this guy's Xavier's one of them
he seems to genuinely wanna help you and that is a rare thing for people like us
Train Rumbles
so what do you say
Give these geeks one more shot
Come on
i will take care of you
you promise
yeah
yeah i promise
Come along now

Young people
Sirens Wailing

Hold it right there
Stay where you are
Put your hands over your heads now
you Homo sapiens and your guns
that is enough Eric
Let them go
Why not come out where i can see you Charles
what do you
Want her for
can not you read my mind
what now
Save the girl
you will have to kill me Charles
and what will that accomplish
Let them pass that law
they will have you in chains with a number burned into your forehead
it won't be
that way
then kill me and find out
huh
then release me
Fine
Gunshot
Crowd Gasping Screaming
Care to press your luck Charles
Guns Cocking
i do not think i can stop them all
Grunting
Still unwilling to make sacrifices
that is what makes you weak
Good bye Charles
you said he wanted me
i made a terrible mistake
his helmet was somehow designed to block my telepathy
i could not see what he was after till it was too late
where are you going
i am gonna find her
how
the traditional way
Look
Logan you can not do this alone
who is gonna help me
you
so far you have all done a bang up job
then help us
Fight with us
Fight with you
what join the team
be an X Man
who the hell do you think you are
you are a mutant
the whole world out there is full of people that hate and fear you
and you are wasting your time trying to protect'em
i got better things to do
you know Magneto's right
there is a war coming
you sure you are on the right side
at least i have chosen a side
i am looking for Dr Jean Grey
Senator Kelly
i am Professor Charles Xavier
i was afraid if i went to a hospital they would
Treat you like a mutant
we are not what you think
not all of us
Tell it to the ones who did this to me
Senator
i want you to try and relax
i am not going to hurt you
Welcome to the future brother
the machine emits radiation that triggers mutation in ordinary human beings
but the mutation is unnatural
Kelly's body is rejecting it
his cells began to break down almost immediately
what effect does radiation have on mutants
there appears to be none
but i fear it will seriously harm any normal person exposed to it
so what does Magneto want with Rogue
i do not know
Cyclops
Wait a second
you said this machine draws its power from Magneto
and that it weakened him
Xavier
yes
in fact it nearly killed him
he is gonna transfer his power to Rogue and use her to power the machine
is somebody there
yes
i am here
Please do not leave me
do not want to be alone
all right
do you hate normal people
sometimes
Why
i suppose
i am afraid of them
Well
i think you have got one less person to to be afraid of
Gasps
Cyclops you and Storm ready the jet
i am gonna find Rogue
Jean get Logan a uniform
Whoa wait a minute
he is not coming with us is he
yes
i am sorry Professor but he will endanger the mission
and if
Hey i was not the one who gave the train station a new sun roof pal
no you were the one who stabbed Rogue through the chest
Scott
Hey why do not you take your little mission and stick it up your
Senator Kelly is dead
i am going to find her
Settle this
i am sorry
Bee ping
Cyclops
you cans till hear me can not you
you have taught me everything in my life that was ever worth knowing
and if anything happens
and if anything happens well i will take care of them
Jean
Jean
no
Jean
Jean
Answer me
Please
i know where Magneto's going
Thud Man Groaning
Magnificent is not she
i have seen it
i first saw her in 1949
America was gonna be the land of tolerance of peace
are you going to kill me
yes
Why
because there is no land of tolerance
there is nope ace
not here or anywhere else
Women and children whole families destroyed simply because they were born different from those in power
Well after tonight the world's powerful will be just like us
they will return home as brothers
as mutants
our cause will be theirs
Your sacrifice will mean our survival
i will understand if that comes as small consolation
Put her in the machine
i will raise it
Cyclops
Magneto is here
Liberty Island
now presumably his objective is to mutate the world leaders at the U N summit on Ellis Island
he doesn't know his machine kills
and judging from what the Professor saw if Magneto gave Rogue enough power
Jean
he could wipe out everyone in New York City
Cyclops
we can insert here at the George Washington Bridge come around the bank just off of Manhattan
we land on the far side of Liberty Island here
what about harbor patrol
Radar
if they have anything that can pick up our jet they deserve to catch us
Whirring
you actually go outside in these things
Well what would you prefer yellow spandex
Engines Revving
Engines Firing
Whoa
okay there is the bridge
i am taking her down
Storm some cover please
Toad Mystique stays harp
we are not alone
and you stay here
Once i give my power to the girl i will be temporarily weakened
you will be my only defense
Thunder Rumbles
Sounds like a storm's coming
Sorry
you call that a landing

the first dignitaries started to arrive about an hour ago greeted with a sort of garden party atmosphere which was designed to entertain them
as the others traversed the rigid security
Alarm Wails

You'd better close your eyes

Mystique
Mystique
i have seen Senator Kelly
so the good senator survived his fall and the swim to shore
he is become even more powerful than i could have imagined
he is dead
Storm
it is true
i saw him die
Like those people down there will die
are you sure you saw what you saw
i would also like to thank the president of the United States for hosting this event under the lights of the great city of New York
Why do none of you understand what i am trying to do
those people down there they control our fate and the fate of every other mutant
Well soon our fate will be theirs
Rogue

Cyclops can you hit it
Cyclops
the rings are too fast
i will kill her
Logan
Just shoot it
Storm can you get me up there
i can not control it like that
you could fly right over the torch
then let me go
if i do not make it then at least you can still blast the damn thing

Jean use your power
Try to steady him
Hang on to something
Scott wait

Just wait

Come on
Hey this one's alive
Let's get him out of here
Welcome back
i knew you'd find your way
i had you to guide me
how did we do
oh
oh that tickles
Hey
Hey
how are you feeling
Fantastic
that was a brave thing you did
Did it work
yeah
she is fine
she took on a few of your more charming personality traits for a while
Chuckles Coughing
but we lived through it
i think she is a little taken with you
Well you can tell her my heart belongs to someone else
you know you and i
how is the professor
he is good
Good
there is an abandoned military compound at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies close to where we found you
there is not much left but you might find some answers
Thank you
are you going to say good bye to them
Man on TV
the Mutant Registration Act lost its main proponent today with the dramatic reversal of Senator Robert Kelly who until this time had provided the loudest voice in the cry for mutant registration
i was wrong on this particular issue
and i hope in time i may be forgiven
Thank you
the Mutant Registration Act continues to draws up port
Storm
Mystique
Cyclops
Son of a bitch from many Parents Rights groups who feel threatened by unidentified mutants in their school systems
in a related story the body of Senator Kelly's long time aide Henry Guy rich was found today
Preliminary coroner reports seem to indicate that Guy rich was maul ed by a bear
Rogue
Hey
you running again
no not really
i have some things to take care of up north
i kind of like it
i do not want you to go
Sniffles
i will be back for this
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night
the feeling that someday they will pass that foolish law or one just like it and come for you and your children
it does indeed
what do you do when you wake up to that
i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school looking for trouble
Why do you come here Charles
Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers
oh yes
Your continuing search for hope
you know this plastic prison of theirs won't hold me forever
the war is still coming Charles and i intend to fight it by any means necessary
and i will always be there old friend23 976
Hey man
Help a brother out
Baker do you copy
okay
Remember now honey pie 3 00 a m and 3 000 000
Put the fear of God in them
you will hear me coming Daddy
Lester you just try and keep your hands off your pecker now
what can i get for you
what are you offering

and if my taste runs toward musicians who happen to have their own club
Hey that makes you an epicurean baby
Excuse me
Mike Gooding CYA Records
i just listened to that set man
Nice
Very impressed very impressed
my man
Welcome to little Jazz
Thank you
Hey you want to meet the band
Sure

Enjoy the show
Too much oil
Excuse me
you use too much oil
you are wearing Caron Poivre which is a good fragrance for you but it is being ruined by the oil
Bravo
you are very good about the perfume but i do not use oil on my skin
i did not mention anything about your skin
Think it is on the gun you are wearing
i think tonight's gonna end very badly between us
Overwatch we got a vehicle pulling up
Like a low rent Cirque du Soleil type thing
it is being towed by a garbage truck

Probably a couple hawks on the roof
it is time to set your brother loose

Dom
Dom
Injuns 2 cowboys zero
okay so we got some things on the date
April 19th
on current or planned events we drew nothing but historically
Baker some stuff came up
Oklahoma City bombing took place on April 19th
both the Bay of Pigs and the siege at Waco ended April 19th and what a lot of Americans do not realize is that April 19th was originally Patriot's Day
but Baker April 19th was the day that Weed lost his family
Jesus Christ
what the hell is True Patriot
from what i can glean some kind of reverse PR campaign against the United States on or around the time of widespread international criticism of the US government
so we already look bad and this is supposed to make us look worse
okay what kind of ops are we talking about
Torture of prisoners in US custody all photographed
Radiation poisoning of a Russian official by the ClA
Murder of an Iraqi family supposedly by a US soldier and the bombing of a subway in an allied country in order to sway support against the Iraqi war
all carried out under the banner of True Patriot
Prisoner torture that is Abu Ghraib
Radiation poisoning Litvinenko
Iraqi family murders Mahmudiyah killings
Train station bombings Madrid subway attacks
Look i want you to dig deep on this
okay
i want bank accounts i want anything and everything
Already done
we got classic shells offshore so no one who was not staring at them would ever connect them to True Patriot
they are similar to the tracking accounts this Hal Leuco character is using to go after Weed
Nice
Osterberg
Hey
do not shit yourself son
it is just me
hi
i look like that dude the one in Platoon
he is in Sniper
one shot one kill
all these gentlemen callers competing for your attention
i like the single life
Look this situation you know what they say
2 heads are better than 1
Bigger targets
i do not need your help
then why haven't you killed me already
the night's still young
Well hello handsome
Walter why did not you tell me that today
April 19th is the day your wife and daughter died
it hadn't occurred to me
someone says you are gonna die the last thing you think about is the date
Something's not right here Walter
you know how some people they get a trick knee before it rains
you see i get this twinge in my gut and it is never let me down and right now it is telling me either you or this situation is full of shit
which one is it
is it
that is outrageous Agent Baker
yes and i resent what you are implying
i have given the better part of my life to this bureau and my country
you have no right to speak to me this way

Walter you are a government official
you are about to murder your own
for the greater good
there are men outside that door that are wanted enemy combatants directly aligned against our country
they have engaged in the most heinous acts ever perpetrated against the United States
in 40 years i have never had the opportunity to do anything heroic
Walter this is not heroic
this is sanctioned murder
you are sweeping up for somebody Walter okay
Hal Leuco fed you a line of bullshit and now they are using you Walter
i am not being used
i lied to you
i am well aware of True Patriot a vicious coordinated assault by animals like Finbar McTeague conducting tortures in the name of American interests
he stages these sessions photographs them and disseminates the pictures around the world
and Ariella Martinez mercenary well versed in exotic poisons and toxicology
she liquidates a Russian dissident with radioactive poison used only by the US military
Lazlo Soot
he murders an Iraqi family and pins it on a US soldier
those crazed hillbillies the Tremors
the True Patriot is a fabrication
Hal Leuco made it up
they blew up a train station in Spain
it swayed a major election voted in a liberal president who then pulled his support on the Iraqi war
191 people were killed today and more than 2 000 were
it seems the train targeted by the bombers were either in station or
These are cold blooded mercenaries and killers in open warfare against our government
they have been sent a contract on me to lure them here where i can terminate all of them
okay Walter wait a minute
everything you know about True Patriot is a lie
yes
Hal Leuco whoever or whatever the fuck he is he is been planning on using you for months maybe even years in advance
yes Walter
they planted these stories
they stitched them together to get you here to this moment
it is blowback Walter
everyone you mentioned all those enemy combatants yeah they have done some sinister things Walter but on behalf of the US government and now they want them dead
do you see what is happening here
this is not about patriotism
this is about eradication
no
yes and that is what they are doing to you Walter
do not let them
do not
no
my wife and my daughter were taken from me
by what
Chance
Ideas live on Agent Baker
People do not
and when i roll out that door and detonate these explosives
i join the grid of destiny
i will be remembered
i will be history
you have a choice
Destiny's plaything or avenging angel
Please do not do this
Walter
Walter please
Fuck
Come on
Come on
Help me
Help me boy
Help me
Help me boy
i will help you you old fucker
Sir
Sir are you okay
Hey buddy you all right

Gun
he is got a gun
i am Agent Baker
i am in charge
do not
do not move
Get down on the ground
Get off him
he is FBl
you 4 lock this place down check for survivors
See to Lester Young there while you are at it
Agent Baker i am Special Agent Anthony Vejar
i know you have been through hell but i am out of time
where is Walter Weed
he is dead
you can verify that
you saw him die
you saw a body
he blew himself up into a million pieces
i am gonna ask you one more time
Did you see a body
Did you actually see him die
he was sitting on enough C 4 to level downtown Chicago
he was a suicide bomber
there is no body to recover
we have reason to believe that Walter Weed was Hal Leuco
what
we think Leuco was some sort of cleanup man taking care of old assets like the Tremors McTeague Lazlo Soot in order to eradicate any link to True Patriot anyone he'd dealt with personally
there is an element of shadow government behind this
ClA NSA agency in the black
it is unclear but you and your men were used co opted
okay wait a minute wait a minute
my team did an extensive background check
they tracked Weed all the way back to his childhood
he worked for the agency for God's sakes
it was all fabricated
Leuco papered disseminated information in the agency to create the illusion of Weed
Hal Leuco is not even a real name
it is short for Haliaeetus leucocephalus
it is Latin for bald eagle
you want bald eagles on your playing cards i think you have earned it
the assassins the money we were tracking where did all that come from
as Walter Weed Leuco had access to bureau intel everything we'd been working on domestically
as Hal Leuco he was privy to more than his share of ClA ops
we were a week away from proving the connection between the 2 when this happened
3 000 000
that is good
i am glad
how could he get away with 2 identities working at the highest level of intelligence
Leuco is a ghost a will o the wisp
now you see him now you do not
that is why i needed to know did you see him die
are you sure
how could he survive that blast
how the hell did you do that
i can not tell you that
it will spoil it
Son of a bitch

Ooh
it is just together they kind of scream socialism
Casey's gonna decline
Well Sarah and i thought they were nice
i bet
so did Chairman Mao hmm
i could talk to Sarah about it
i would
i have a big day planned at the Buy more for Casey i am gonna get out of here
Good luck
Hey
you have a lot to talk about
have fun
MORGAN CHUCKLES
Hey
Silly quick little question do our wedding colors remind you of socialism
in a good way
is there a good way
uh i do not wanna make a thing out of it so let's call Daphne
yeah get her on speakerphone
i love that gal
PHONE BEEPS
OPERATOR
we are sorry
the number you have reached is not in service
Please check the number or try your call again
you sure you dialed the right number
SARAH
oh my God
i can not believe it
we have been conned
we have been conned
she is already cashed our check
and our account has been emptied out
i just do not understand
she came so highly recommended by the Internet
i should have seen this coming
she asked for our money up front she gave us a 40 percent discount
you know if there is one thing i am not Chuck it is a sucker
me neither
we are not a couple of sappy helpless lovebirds
yeah that is right
we are ClA agents
Daphne Peralta she chose the wrong couple to con
that is us right honey
of course i mean us
i thought there was another couple
Getting in the car
you know for an amateur con Daphne Peralta sure is hard to find
i do not get it
we have traced every cell phone every bank account and nothing
she must have hundreds of aliases
she is a ghost
not literally
she is not an apparition we are dealing with but in the sense she is hard to find
i have used every available resource to find her
we could ask General Beckman for help
to locate our wedding planner
i do not think that is gonna go down well
she stole from us but you are taking this hard
Well of course i am
i was raised by a con man and i got taken
we have done everything to make it right
we have left no stone unturned
not every stone
here is where you see your new shopping center
the Nagamichi Complex 2011
i got chills just thinking about it
do we have a deal
SARAH
Jack Burton
uh give me one minute gentlemen
Old business associate of mine
oh my daughter conned
i know
Chuck and i were throwing this party and
Wow you are still in Burbank with the uh schnook
how is that
Fine
anyway the party planner she ran off with all of our money
Know Daphne Peralta
have you worked with her
no i am sorry darling i have never heard that name before
Why do not you uh use some of your vast ClA resources to find her
how did you find out
i took a peek at your wallet
Fancy federal ID there
i am a little surprised you turned out to be such an upstanding citizen
and a little proud too
i have used all of my available resources
i do not have the authority to go any further
Why let that stop you
Con means confidence you know that
you remember that summer that we spent in Savannah
CHUCKLES
where we lived in the governor's mansion
if you do not have the authority pretend you do
that is right
Fake it till you make it
okay
Thanks for your help Dad
that is it
you are not gonna explain to me what happened in the last two years to make you go from con to mark
in a while crocodile
Hey Dad
Funny meeting you here
Hey
Ha ha
hello
Why do i feel like this is an ambush
Today is the day
what
you move out
who is gonna do your laundry
Today is the day you speak to Kathleen
and tell her that you are still alive
Yay
Yay
not gonna happen
okay Dad you have been putting this off for a week
it is gonna be hard but you have to
you said we are gonna do this together
i am not avoiding anything
Your mother believes that i am dead
if she walks into the Buy more she will think i left her for some crappy job
she deserves better than that
so much for that great idea
yeah
it is not such a great plan after all was it
okay
be cool be cool
you guys find that new iPad case you were looking for
no no
we are actually completely sold out of them
i am very disappointed about it
we are just gonna go
they do not have it
there is all these cases
ALEX
no no
that is the wrong generation
you want me to what
Just fake a flash
a little one
on Daphne Peralta
i question your dad's influence because that is crazy
we have gone as far as we can without Beckman
and all we need to do is access the FBl's Echelon satellites
she can either help us or we lose Daphne and our wedding
okay okay
Fine
i will just give her one of these
and voil access granted
uh it doesn't look like that
no
what does it look like exactly
Well it kind of looks like you saw something really bright and tasted something sour at the same time
i do not know i mean if i had to do it it would kind of be like
Like that
oh
what
Well i thought it was good
Wait you do not like my flash
it is not that i do not like it
but then tell me
Hmm
she lives with the schnook
DEVON
Yo bro
you are in Neighborhood Watch territory go ahead try and run
i will be faster because i have superior form
Ha ha ha
Whoa whoa whoa no no
my daughter lives here
Sarah Walker

Sorry about all the Neighborhood Watch talk
Just protecting the fam you know

Well i was uh gonna surprise Sarah but obviously she is not home
the problem is i got nowhere else to go
GASPS
oh well i am uh on baby duty so
oh of course
Sure
I'd be happy to help out

BABY GlGGLES
SARAH
i have been following somebody
a woman that i think may be more dangerous than we expect
BECKMAN OVER MONlTOR
who is she
Daphne Peralta
Chuck did you just flash
that i did partner
and you are right this Daphne Peralta is a very dangerous woman
what did you see
Connections
Specifically connections between her and other dangerous people
who specifically
Anan Magoro
but we just took down the entire Magoro terrorist cell
was there anyone else
yeah
yeah
who was that
Artur Novokov
Artur Novokov
he blew up three U S Embassies in Africa last week
i am putting out an interdepartmental call to ClA NSA and FBl
this could be the most important piece of U S Intelligence work
uh general before you do that you should actually know that
i want every resource we have redirected towards one singular goal
the location and apprehension of this woman Daphne Peralta
i want her captured dead or alive
what
how am i supposed to know who Artur Novokov is
because you work for the ClA
it is not my fault
we have been planning a wedding i have been busy
and besides who puts a story this important on page 13
oh one of the Kardashian girls just got her GED
Allegedly
all branches of U S Military are about to launch an attack on our planner
it is not gonna take them long to figure out the connection
but the good news is now we have access to all of the agencies' databases
Daphne Peralta we are coming for you
Keep your eye on it kid
Ready
BABY COOlNG
what do you think
DEVON
so you here for the big day
what big day
um
oh today
every day's a big day to me
i am a go getter
Carpe diem
Hey
i got you a toy
yeah your favorite toy
you are good with her
BABY GlGGLES
yeah you know at first it was tough
i mean really tough
then i started to learn Clara's signals
Signals
yeah like when she wants her pacifier she puts her hands to her face
Like a tell in poker right
Sure
my daughter ooh
she is a tough one to read
i taught her to keep things close
i said the second you let your guard down you get hurt
there
she did
she let her guard down
and now i wanna know why
BABY CRYlNG
you do not mind if i stick around a bit do you
you get HBO right
BEEPS
Sarah would it surprise you that your father is at Ellie and Devon's
what
of course
Baby at this point maybe we should just tell him about the wedding
it will make everything easier he'd love to be there
Dad hasn't been there for an important day in my life
so let's just focus on Daphne
i think i found her on one of these FBI Echelon satellites
this was taken five minutes ago
so what is a SuperShuttle
Reliable transport at a reasonable price
Leaving Pasadena on the 134
i got an idea
SuperShuttle
hi
yes I'd like to organize a pickup
yes i do have a AAA card
okay i managed to shut off Castle's satellite feed
you have five minutes to get Daphne off that shuttle
Beckman's already got Casey in the field with a SWAT team
General do we have a location on the target
not yet
our satellites are still dark but we are getting them back up now
i will be ready
oh my God Rosa i met this super hot guy at the Winston
Daphne Peralta
CLEARS THROAT
Surprise
Chuck Bartowski
i work for the United States government
and you ma'am are under arrest
CHUCK OVER RADlO
Sarah i got her
we will get her off the van at the next stop
Watch this
what are you doing
Get away from me
oh my God somebody please do something
what is going on back there
nothing
i work for the U S Government
he does not
this weirdo is my ex boyfriend
he is been stalking me
there is a stalker
oh my God he just exposed himself
no i did not
Aah
this guy just totally exposed himself to this woman on the SuperShuttle
Please do something
okay everyone just calm down
i did not expose myself
what is going on in there
nothing
Everything's under control
i am fine
how are you
i told you we should've taken a taxi
what is it 15 more
Quiet down all of you okay
we are already late
now who is flying Southwest
you
okay
Colonel i was able to get a trace on our target
Sending it to you now
Hmm
SuperShuttle
Good cover
no one would give it a second look
Listen up men
Daphne Peralta is smart and dangerous
i do not wanna lose anyone today so keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready
you heard her
we are going in hot
Hoo ah
Listen you have got to get Daphne off that shuttle right now
i am working on it
Right
i am talking through an earpiece to an agent who wears an earpiece because we are agents
no more messing around
Stop this
no way man
i will lose my job if i do not get everybody to the airport on time
i am extremely unstable
Aah
DRlVER
what are you talking about
if you do not pull over this van i will expose myself to you and everyone else in this vehicle
oh
oh my God
oh
Blondie's here too huh
this is already spiraling out of control
the ClA's gonna be here any minute get in the car
Listen ha ha i get it that you are angry okay
but there is not a damn thing you can do
Your little government con
it failed
i am calling your bluff
TlRES SCREECH
we are in really big trouble
yeah
she is your wedding planner
do you two have any idea what you have done
an inkling yeah
i am to blame general
it was my idea
we all have personal lives
it should not interfere with the mission
BECKMAN
you are both to blame
i just thank God that Miss Peralta is not going to press charges
Press charges
she is a thief general
she stole 26 230 from us
for the foreseeable future you are both suspended
General this is Daphne's client book
it has all the people she is conned in it
the Bartholomews they were promised a horse drawn carriage
over here
oh look at that the Gerlichs
Look at all the family they have flying in from Hungary
the airfare alone
oh
General the bride's brothers are Hungarian scientists
Let me guess you flashed
yeah
yes i did
i did i did yes
Bruno Franz and Paulie Klg they have been working for the Iranian government
they have all of Iran's nuclear research on a portable device called the Zephyr
the face was more convincing this time but i am still not buying
you are not to pursue anyone or anything until you earned back the trust of the government
and if history is any indication then that might take a while
MONlTOR BEEPS
okay now where is the ball
this one
Really
you sure
okay
Nope
you see the secret to the shell game is the ball's not in any of these
it is right here in my pocket
Once you know all the cons you will never be a sucker
GRANDMA
Your daughter needs a father
JACK
she can count on me
GRANDMA
is that why you are asking for money again
JACK
Whatever you can spare i will double in a month
i am good for it
you are not welcome here anymore
okay okay i get it
Let me say goodbye first
GRANDMA
no
i can not imagine what it must be like for that girl to constantly say goodbye to her father
she deserves better
CAR DOOR CLOSES
CAR ENGlNE STARTS
i do not wanna live with Grandma
i am coming with you
no i do not think that is a good idea
but i brought this
you need it right
SlGHS
i can not sweetie
this is your money
but i know you are good for it
Plus we do not need that money to have an adventure together
CHUCKLES
you are right
all we need is you and me
you want some ice cream
no
i am sorry my advice did not pan out
is that why you are here because you were worried
yeah
a skosh
here
what is wrong
Mm
Work thing i probably should not discuss it
Come on give your old man a chance
i do know a thing or two about criminals
Maybe i can help
okay well there are these three brothers called the Klgs
they are never in the same place but they are going to be in L a for their sister's wedding
they carry around this device with them called the Zephyr but they rotate it amongst themselves and um
you know never mind this is
no i am listening
Your mark are the Klgs and the Zephyr's the package
Right
but the problem is the wedding reception that they are supposed to be at is one of Daphne's cons
any way that we could make that wedding reception happen
Daphne's records did say that she never met the Gerlichs in person but even if i convinced them it is still on how could i throw a 100 000 wedding in 24 hours with no ClA resources
because darling you got me
i know you guys are all used to having some high tech resources at your fingertips
but everything i know i learned in the'80s when VCRs and rollerblades were the cutting edge so just bear with me
Especially you Chuck
Just wanted to thank you guys for including me on this
Always wanted to pull a con so
Daphne Peralta promised the Gerlichs a lavish reception at the grand Ambassador Hotel Ballroom
WHlSTLES
that is beautiful
Unfortunately the ballroom was booked months in advance for Tammy Katz's bat mitzvah
so it is a no go
not necessarily
JACK
Bat mitzvah starts at 8 and our reception begins at 6 30
Ma'am can i help you
SARAH
so you gonna act like you do not know who i am now
Daphne Peralta Tammy Katz's bat mitzvah coordinator
now per Tammy i called in advance to ensure I'd have the room for two hours before the party
Tammy's got a theme for tonight
Hungarian wedding
Ahem
Casey what are you doing here
i came to stop you
you are in deep enough as it is
but Casey the three Klg brothers will all be here tonight
one of them will be carrying the Zephyr that has Iran's nuclear research
Sounds crazy but it is true
Look i should not have lied to you
i did it to protect you
i am sorry
it was a mistake but what Chuck is talking about is very real
okay what can i do to help
Hey cop face
Glad you could join us
i think we got a job for you
WHAT i LlKE ABOUT YOU PLAYlNG ON SPEAKERS
all right all you party people let's get this shindig a going
Come on
MAN SlNGlNG
Hey
uh huh
Hey
that is what i like about you that is what i like about you
Hey
there you go
Enjoy
Still no sign of the Klgs
Keep stalling
Alrighty folks
Let's slow things down for a second huh
Grab that special someone and show them how much you love them
AT LAST PLAYlNG ON SPEAKERS
shall we
you are asking me to dance
we got time
WOMAN SlNGlNG
my love has come along
and my Ionely days
Plus uh it could be the only chance i get to dance with my daughter at a wedding
WOMAN
and life is like a song
um
uh
Chuck and i are getting married
i know
CHUCKLES
i am sorry i did not invite you
no no you were right not to
i do not exactly have a great track record of uh
Well being around
Truth is i uh
i never thought my little girl would settle down
i thought you'd end up more like me just one adventure after another never stay in one place too long
is not that what you wanted
it was
but um i found a home here a good one and i am happy
i am sorry Dad
DOOR OPENS
got my eyes on the Klg brothers
be careful
they are armed and dangerous
you ready for this
Just like old times kid
all right Sarah
you are up
Klg number one is approaching the bar
Mr Klg hello
Daphne Peralta wedding planner
are you enjoying the party
yes it is very nice
it would not be the same without your extraordinarily generous gift to the Gerlichs
the toaster
no silly
the open bar
no no no
this is a mistake
oh i am sorry
i have got your credit card on file in the back and if you just follow me i am sure we can sort this mess out okay
Again i am so sorry for the inconvenience dear

GRUNTS

Unh

KATHLEEN

Unbelievable
i can not believe you dated Parisa too

Hey tell you what why do not we just go drink a toast to her
Good stuff's in the back
Ha

SlGHS

CHUCK OVER RADlO
we have neutralized the Klgs
Let's get out
to work part time as a security guard and moonlight at the Buy more
Really can not talk to you about this right now
Please
you need to leave
i talked to Alex and uh she already knew
she thinks you are some kind of hero or something
that you work for the government that
she wanted to believe it so much
i guess i did too
CHUCK
Casey where are you
you should go
but only if you promise to tell Alex the truth
you wanna be a part of her life you owe her that
i do not wanna lie to anyone
then do not
Hey where is the DJ
he needs to make an announcement
they are just about to cut the cake
oh the cake
Right
uh the DJ will be back in a minute i promise
he is in the bathroom so do not worry
what am i looking for
Well the Zephyr's small like a portable hard drive
Bruno's clean
so is Paulie
this one too
then where is the device
how do none of them have it
SlGHS
Guys listen to me people are getting restless all right
the father of the bride wants to cut the cake
and in case everybody has forgot the cake is made of Styrofoam
Unh
i do not get it
i mean my flash said that one of the Klg brothers keeps the Zephyr on him at all times
it is a shell game
what
Right
the Klgs are just decoys to keep everybody distracted
we did not know it because they have never been in the same place
in the game the ball is always close by
which means someone else here has the Zephyr
Coming through coming through
that knife is very dirty
this is their moment
SQUEAKS
the cake is made of Styrofoam and you knew it
what is really going on here
where are my sons
who do you work for
Daphne Peralta
Let's talk outside
we need to get back out there
MORGAN OVER RADlO
Listen there is no reason for the gun sir
uh i mean Mr Father of the Bride
Morgan where is he taking you
MORGAN
oh what a lovely parking garage
no no no
Hold on a second
i am nobody
i am nobody
There'd virtually be no consequence in you letting me go
the same goes for killing you
what
CHUCK
Freeze
Put your gun down
you are under arrest
Stop
CHUCK
Morgan
CASEY
Hey
you got no place to go
GRUNTS
hi Casey
hi Morgan
Sorry Casey
you would not risk your partner's life
you won't pull trigger
JACK
you could not be more wrong my friend
Listen
can i call you friend
what is your dad doing
Just give him a minute
this man is going to shoot you and he is not going to miss
i am hoping that he doesn't have to kill you
See i have got a daughter too
and based on the situation here l'm thinking you are not the best father in the world
Heh join the club
i guess the only thing we can really hope for is that someday our little girls might be happy despite us
and yours is
she is upstairs right now in her white dress
and here you are about to take a bullet in the head
so do one thing for her friend
Put the gun down
Turn around
POLlCE SlREN WAlLING
Colonel John Casey
NSA
the behavior you two displayed with your wedding planner
Con woman was unprofessional and unacceptable
General i promise i will never fake a flash again
we are very sorry general
however my superiors were impressed with the exceptional work you did in acquiring the Zephyr device
though i question how you managed to accomplish that task without any ClA resources
uh well it was really um
you could chalk it up to
i have a feeling the less i know the better
Hmm
Welcome back
you are dismissed
SlGHS
that went better than expected
i thought so
Hmm
yeah
you leaving already
yeah
i got wind of a wealthy Alabama couple looking into orange futures and i am pretty sure i own a bunch of those so
huh
i am on the next flight out
okay but Sarah's on her way home
she will be here soon
Hmm
we have never been great at goodbyes
Look i uh know that you never got a proper invitation in the mail or anything but just watching you and Sarah
Look she'd never say it but it'd mean the world to her if you came to our wedding and walked her down the aisle
you should follow my daughter's lead
she knows me very well
i wish you both the best but uh i am afraid i won't be able to make the wedding
what do you mean
you are her dad
i have always been a better con man than a father
i made a promise to myself a long time ago to never promise her something i could not give her
she is had her heart broken too many times by me
i uh
i just do not wanna do it again
Just
Hey just
Just stay for dinner at least
Please
all right Charlie i will stay for dinner
Good good
Thank you
this is my fault
i just never thought I'd see you again
she does that
Hmm
Alex
that thing with your hand
Alex does that when she is nervous
oh
uh
Hadn't realized
never noticed
CASEY SlGHS
Alex is amazing
you should be proud
you have done a great job Kath
Well it will be easier for her now that i know
Well i did not just do it for her
Look at you
you are a soldier you are a hero
you have everything that you have ever wanted
Hey baby
Hey
so i was doing a little research and i was thinking that a courthouse wedding might be kind of romantic
or at the very least within our new budget
that sounds nice
Mm hm
and i got all the ingredients for dinner with your dad
i am making your favorite chicken pepperoni
where is he
he is gone
Did he tell you he was leaving
he did not have to
it is what my dad does Chuck
he just leaves
Once you know all the cons you can never be a sucker
Come here sweetie
GRUNTS
See you later alligator
JACK
you gave this to me a long time ago and i want you to know i never spent a dime of it
i only ever added to it
it should more than cover the cost of your wedding to the schnook
i hope now you can have all the adventures you ever wanted with a man far better than me

Anna Anna

of course he became a coachman during the Commune and he is used to it
Stop pushing
Everybody will get in
the next please
i am ready Mr Bthory good bye
Good bye dear Anna
Did you make this too
yes
the last time you gave me a piece of cake it was really good
because i put butter into it
that is why
i wanted to ask you something a long time ago
Ask then
have you ever seen me not like this
Properly dressed in civilian clothes
i did once but it was so strange
i did not recognize you because you had a hat on
we laughed at it with Stefi
other people wear hats too
yes of course but
but you Mr Bthory i never saw you like that
that is why
my dear Anna
would you come to my place sometimes
Why
I'd show you my flat
and the little Erzsi my daughter
she is twelve years old
but recently she is always loafing
i can not manage her
when did your wife die
it will be two years this autumn
in atrophy
she needs someone
we need a woman
Well
you will find one
you are not too old and you earn well
i was offered a widow from Erzsbet
she is got a small house
you see
but i do not like her
if it would have been you
do not be silly Mr Bthory
i am serious
i thought about it a lot
Anna
Stop your chatting
Hurry up you have to go to Dr Moviszter to get a receipt
Your mistress is a terrible woman
the doctor is always laughing at her
he says she has only one problem
but he can not cure that
Still she has brains enough to count the sugar cubes
she is stingy is not she
how can you get on with her
me
Well
you are a damned fool
you became famous in our district
you are the ideal maid
is the doctor's wife playing the piano
yes
from morning till evening always the same thing
she is not normal either
here is the receipt my dear
two tablets three times a day but your mistress knows it
you seem to be anaemic
Visit me one of these days
Anna
Anna where are you
Run before she pulls your ears
Thank you good bye
Good morning young man
Good morning
Good morning
Sir
are you leaving like this
in slippers
what are you grinning at
Care about yourself
Your breasts and legs
Why are not you nude
Well go on
and tell me doesn't she steal
do not you know Anna
do not you know this miracle
no i haven't had the pleasure yet
i haven't been introduced yet
what a lovely woman
you will see her now
she doesn't go to the movies or theatre she has no lover no family
she is sitting at home all day
she doesn't even go out on Sundays
of course one must be firm but
Put it down my child
Well this is Anna
my Anna
but next time do not come in these shoes
Go out my child
Good afternoon Anna
Good afternoon young man
Anna
i am sorry for yelling at you in the morning
Well he is crazy about you
who
Mr Bthory
Ah
he says he'd worship you if you married him
i would not hesitate for a moment
she will get along fine as long as she is her own master
do not listen to her
She'd run on all fours if he'd ask her
you must not miss that chance Anna
he is an independent contractor
you will marry him won't you
i do not know
Anna you are not listening
what a fool you are
what a chance
Pour out the coffee please
i am in a hurry
Etel kill that chicken while i take the coffee in
what kind of a village girl you are
you can not even do this
i can not do it
my mother scoled me for it too
Mikls can give evidence how much Etel can eat
that is incredible but last week she ate two plates of pastry
she can swallow a big quantity of food
our Stefi is not at loss either for a little appetite
my Anna eats less than a bird
what do you think she eats for supper
you can not guess
nothing
she doesn't even touch fine dishes
she doesn't like them
Maybe she likes them too much
do not you understand Mikls
she told it herself
that is why
do you give her the same food you eat
i bet you do not
how could she defend herself
she makes herself believe that these things are not good anyhow
Give her good things to eat you will see how she likes them
you have gone crazy
that is what their peasant stomach needs
Nonsense
my dear Mikls you are red in secret
and how cleverly he disguised it
an old fox
Cheers old Bolshevik
Leave me alone i do not drink
i do not believe in equality my dear doctor
this doesn't exist
Maids are maids
their stomachs are different their souls are different
may l
Thank you
Won't you have some sugar
Thanks
Play something for us darling
oh really
that lovely song
you know

with pleasure
Thank you
Thank you Anna

Six chemises three petticoats
Three nightgowns

Well my dear Anna
Give me time to think Mr Bthory

Once upon a time there was a little boy

with the nest of a golden bird that knew the little boy's thoughts

that person is candidate Kim Bong Wee's financial manager
we have the evidence
should we crash now
Hold
Pull out the list with all the ones involved
Let's get them all at once
Joined up with MooKungWha
yes the cash has already been forwarded to them
you are going to just flush our 20 years relationship down
how dare you do that like this
i give him an inch and he is already above my head
you are saying that we should take care of DongBang gang first
yes
can not we do it after the election
i do not think it is the right time
lf we do not move first they will come for us
Sir if you pause here there is no Sharon blossoming
Sharon blossoming is important but i do not want to lose you
my dream is to see the Sharon blossoming and see you in the National Assembly
that way you will be honest with Cherry too
Hmm ls Cherry doing well
yes Sir
Hmm
she has no blessings
i only trust you
Why do not you Hero dislike the U S
because they ignore us
there is reason for that
when our grandmothers were forced to be comfort women for the Japanese military during war they did not do anything to the Japanese rather disrespected our grandmothers
we can not even revenge them so that is why they ignore us
Why can not we get them back
Politicians do agree in retaliation by politics
that is why i think all politicians are big fucks
Boss everything's ready

Sonokong do you think life is worth living

Love that hurts like a needle if you turn away from you it is like a fire that is been put out

after arresting all the gang members the police executive general cracks a smile
Cold blooded girl and hoodlum are living together
Doc takes over the Eowoodong and the Boss room salon
Jina and Poison get married in prison
no one knows where about of the luxury girl
one thing for sure is that everything she has is all imitations
Cherry and TaeHoon start to date
Rose is mentally ill and has a habit of throwing rocks at people's houses5 Women Killed
I'd say it is cruel
if you only see this
by the way you look i assume this is not a social visit
Unreasonable compensation and coercive treatment
is this the result of your research
i do not choose patients
Nor their family situation
i have no security
i stake my life at times the risk is immense
you are infamous among destructive cults and hypocrites i presume
because i am successful with what i am expected to do
my clients are all grateful
i used to respect you as a psychiatrist
Even when my father and Prof Souda criticized your radical methods
i really did
so
you came because you have convinced i am the serial killer
Right
but i do not have a motive
Your motive is beyond common logic
that i present secret codes and mock the world when they are not solved
what about my alibi
you can easily fabricate that
Why be so defensive to your former lover
you did not love me
you only needed me
what you wanted was not me as a woman but the daughter of Prof Takahara the Dean and authority
and me as a competent assistant
you only think in terms of yourself and jump to the conclusion
you have returned to your bad habits
i was scared i could not grasp your heart
the more i tried to explode the more darkness there was with such enormous hollowness
how can such a man love anyone
you do not understand what love is
not even half of it
i know
i am happy now
i have a loving husband and a home
i can not believe how happy i am
i wonder
it is true
he is given me everything you could not
he still tries
you just want everything
the way you are now his destruction is inevitable
you are wrong
you ran away from me and your research
no you ran away
my feelings for you haven't change
for you
i am ready to blow myself up
Stop it
i won't let you control me
Dr Aku
did not you have 2nd degree color blindness
you must know the meaning of these photos
i see strong sense of isolation color blindness and forming a letter with the crime site is the thread leading to the killer
you may not be the direct executioner
you may control someone and that someone maybe projecting your will to through mind control by re brain washing
are you saying it is related to my re brain washing
Interesting
i am afraid you are the one who is becoming deranged
Who'd believe such wild fantasies
24 hours after giving a dosage of LP though still rejecting she has been calmed for the purpose of improving rapport we have injected 2 ampules of haloperidol
and 12 hours later another ampule of haliperidol was added
you can not speak on your own
you say your prayers with this attitude
what is the truth
to believe in our High Priest
what is your High Priest
he is the ultimate God of the universe reborn
what do you mean reborn
to resurrect
to resurrect
how do you know your High Priest is God
the church says so
is that the only ultimate truth
with your attitude mission work is impossible
Try and convert me
you can not do anything on your own
that is right
you can not do anything all alone
Try and convert me
you can not do it
you can not do anything alone
who in the church said that
Leave me alone
is there such a thing as the only ultimate truth
our High Priest is God
he is the only one who can save this world
with your attitude mission work is impossible
Try and convert me
Come to our training center
you can not do it
you can not do it alone
Shut up
is that the attitude of a follower of God
Your attitude is unfit for mission work
Your church is phoney
you have been brain washed
are you happy
are you happy
Why do you do that
you do not understand yourself
some day the messiah will appear and redeem me
there is no Messiah
Please save me
what you are saying is true
i was wrong
i am basically i have an likeable personality
but my sense are so acute that people resent me
you can take it easy now
you have been brain washed
it might take a bit of time but to discover the real you we will work together
you are safe now
when i am with the people around me
i feel i am so different from them
you only listen to what i say but seem to understand my pains
i feel your thoughts are similar to my thoughts
but
i don' t understand which is which V
it is safe now
Go to sleep
i told you i am not hungry
do not worry
i am fully aware of myself
Stop it
they irritate me
the smell the colors
i tried to save her
the pit was so deep and dark i thought it had no bottom
i was so scared scared to death
i remember i held strong to my mother's hand
but
a bee appeared
it hurts
it stung me
Look at it
it is so swollen
i tried to save mother but a bee stung me
Owww it hurts
so you let go of her hand
i am telling the truth
i did not deliberately let go of her hand
it is the truth
Why do not you believe me
how many times do i have to say this
Well i think we'd better go
could
could the killer be after Setsuko
do you have something on your mind
not really
i think Dr Suma should have a little rest
she seems fatigued
have you heard of Dr Rei Aku
yes
they worked together in the lab
do they still keep in touch
i heard she met him in relation to the investigation
do you know exactly on what kind of matters
no
we do not talk much about work
is anything the matter with Dr Aku
Let me know when she is feeling better
Well she she might be holding back some crucial information
the doctor will not remain in the audience seat but be on the stage with the patient
do you follow me
Open your mind
Like dust floating in this air
you disintegrate yourself completely
and helplessly float on and search for your mate
Like making love assimilate with him

Act 2 will soon begin
you are no longer able to step down from the stage
Stop it
Why do not you come
Why do not you come and catch me
i am waiting for you
you dreamed of me again did not you
you know all about me do not you

if so please hang up this moment
Why do not you hang up
Why do not you

you want to hear my voice
that is not true
Come right now to my place

what do you take me for
that door won't open
Unfortunately
i could not wait for your arrival
i can not tell you the reason now
Please wait for me in this room until i return
i know you are here
what is this anyway
are you trying to brainwash me
i was hoping you'd come here
i am not forcing anything on you
Naturally you can refuse to watch this video if you do not want to
Hold your ears if you do not want to hear my voice
you are acting on your free will
is not that right
now let me begin my lecture
you decide what you think feel and act
you use time as you wish
you believe loving and hating people to be your free choice
what is this
are you playing with my mind
you killed them did not you
i have had enough
i have had enough of this
i have had enough
is this the punishment for leaving you
Please repeat that
are all the killings my fault
you want to be free do not you
Let me out of here
Won't you give me the details
Please let me out of here
what did you mean
Please free me
Please
Please repeat that
you have made me your captive
you want to be free do not you
Please let me out of here
Won't you give me the details
i
i love you
i love you even now
Please repeat that
i love you even now
you want to be free do not you
i do not know how to control myself
Please repeat that
you want to be free do not you
Won't you give me the details

Please repeat that
you want to be free do not you
Won't you give me the details
what do you mean
i am all right now
you want to be free do not you
Won't you give me the details
what do you mean
Won't you give me the details
i killed him
i am sorry
i know you were troubled
you want it all
you will destroy him
you are wrong
Disintegration
are you saying
Suma was the real target
Doctor
what is it
BlZARRE THAN THE ACTUAL MURDER
POLlCE INSPECTOR'S HUSBAND WAS a WOMAN
Until yesterday the murdered victim was believed to be a man
the victim Tomoo Suma was the husband of Dr Setsuko Suma an analyst of the Metropolitan Police
the police discovered Mr Suma was equipped with female sex organs
another mystery is added to the serial killing
the killer has managed to be consistent in the serial killing in the most unexpected manner
since the serial killing was thought to have ended fear has increased even more
if the killer knew this and chose
Mr Suma as the target police believe the killer is more bizarre than the former assumptions and increases mystery
a month from the 1st murder with the 6th victim being one of the inspectors' husband and with him being a woman
can you understand such a relationship
i certainly can especially if it is about them
Tomoo was basically an androgynoid
yes an abdrogyne
to have sex organs of both sexes
as Setsuko's career became more established
Tomoo's male sex organs possibly became unnecessary
they were both excellent researcher so
i am sure it was a logical agreement on their part
Only i had no idea Tomoo was emasculated until now
Prof i heard you dislike Aku
i detested him
his insanity and death are stages of high possibilities or strive for higher level or sanity
his mysticism oriented ideas seemed the result of desperation
Wrong attitude for a medical career
he is determined that everything in this world is mad
what about her memory
do not know
Only
she says Aku and herself are responsible for the killings
that their relationship lures the victims to them
that all the victims are their alter egos
Words are typically schizophrenic
for 2 years one of my patients has continuously told me you are the one who is insane
because he was so persistent
i was getting some of the symptoms
i am naturally cured now
my brain was melting and dripped out of my ears
Bodily sensational hallucination
the patient's insanity transferred
when you are low on morale and become unguarded it can be dangerous in our line of business
Just like your job
Being trapped in the patients' paranoia could at times result in death
i am sorry about your husband
i am sorry
Forgive me
we still haven't found Aku
he is missing since your husband was murdered
we got a warrant and searched the Psychorium
we are investigating his other patients
from now on i will personally guard you
i promise i will arrest Aku
shall we go back in
do not know where she was
she did return from the garden
in the hospital robe
yes of course
she was sedated
she could not have gone far from the hospital
the perpetrator's killed 6 for no reason
he is after her
Suma's in danger unless we guard her
are not you afraid
i only have one question
Why are you doing this
is this what you mean by love
is it all my fault
i am no longer afraid of anything
the answer is not always one
but people always seek the only answer
i wonder why
Finally found you Yuki
Doctor
you are a devil
the re brain washing was a fake
you turned me into a killer
you have awaken me manipulated and laughed at me
you enjoy killing
you are a pleasure homicidal mania
that is your hidden personality
it hurts
Father
Father
Why are you silent
a bee stung me
i tried to save mother
it is true
do not you believe me
Father
Why won't you believe me
Why won't you
if you do not believe me kill me please kill me
Kill me
Kill me
it is all my fault
Kill me
Kill me now
Come on
Kill me
now
you said
her death wish does not result from the trauma of the bee and matricide
the trauma is fiction imprinted by me
it was suppose to control the death wish deep inside her mind
Location is 7 14 3
Hagoromo Cho
do you have the identity confirmation of the personnel reporting in
Positive
the personnel reporting in is Rei Aku age 45
from the circumstantial evidence probability of a suicide is very high
and we conclude that
Yuki Takei whose body we found is major suspect of in the serial murders
we have already arranged to send the body to autopsy and informed the dept
in charge
she had this
she loved youYour last word Father
we are all listening
i have the will
According to Mr Inugami's instructions
everyone must be here before i can read it
in the meantime

Yokomizo Kindaichi Omori Ota ku Tokyo

how long are you staying
i am not sure
hello Furutachi Law Office
Mr Kindaichi
i have been expecting you
this is Wakabayashi i wrote the letter
you are back
i can be there in 30 minutes
we will discuss the details
the Sahei Inugami Story
is that the Inugami residence
yes we call it the Inugami Mansion
Old Mr Inugami died 7 months ago
there was a grand funeral
after all everyone around here depended on Inugami Pharmaceuticals
that lady in the boat
is she a member of the family
that is Miss Tamayo
she is not related to Mr Inugami
but he treated her like family
besides she is a beauty
Really
Let's see
i must take a good look
Sir
yes
what do you do
Why do you carry binoculars
Help
Get in
Thanks
you are welcome
we can not get to shore in this boat
i will look into the matter
someone made a hole in the boat
Mr Kindaichi
yes
you have a visitor
i let him in
Thank you
Wait
hi
oh my God
he is dead
do you know him
that is Mr Wakabayashi
Call Forensics
is he murdered
Commissioner
Welcome
i want to see a Yokomizo Kindaichi
do you know him Mr Furutachi
no
he is a key suspect
he claims to be a detective
is that right
i think so
i contacted my associates in Tokyo to verify his identify
they said he is very reliable
Wakabayashi hired you
in addition to the letter
he also sent me this book
he mentioned that something awful will happen to the Inugami family
Say even if something will happen
how did he know
he seemed to believe in it
it appears that way
what
Sahei Inugami's will is locked up in the safe at the office
i think someone read it
you think it is Wakabayashi
we are the only ones with access
Result of the autopsy shows poison in his lungs
about the will
anything suspicious
Probably
Why did Wakabayashi read the will
Mr Kindaichi
Just like Wakabayashi
i need your help in this matter
Really
you saved my life
now that Wakabayashi is dead
i was worried about paying for the inn
Why did not you read the will
the will involves 9 people
they must all be present
who is not here
there is someone with no blood relation
someone Sahei Inugami was very fond of
Miss Tamayo Nonomiya
who is missing
Sukekiyo the only son of his eldest daughter Matsuko
Sukekiyo enlisted in the army
after the war
he wrote a letter home
but he never came back
about 2 weeks ago
he returned to Hakata suddenly
Madam Matsuko left to meet him
other than Madam Matsuko
how many children did Master Sahei have
he was never legally married
he had 3 daughters of different mothers
Matsuko is the eldest
Takeko is the second daughter who lives in Tokyo
her husband Toranosuke is the branch manager in Tokyo
they have a son Suketake and a daughter Sayoko
Mother that is Aunt Matsuko's koto
you are playing it without her permission
she will be upset
where is she
she said Sukekiyo has left the army and wanted us here
she sent a telegram from Hakata
and told us to come as soon as possible
but she is not here herself
it has been 15 days
she always does as she pleases
Did something happen
Sayoko
Grandpa
what about him
his will is all that matters
i will wait as long it takes
Hey Suketake
this is not good
i thought it will only take a few days
i did not expect it to drag on like this
there is food shortage in Tokyo
you are better off here
Right Father
you are back
what took you so long Koukichi
i am back
you are late
Checking up on Headquarters
Stop imagining things
Umeko is the youngest daughter
her husband Koukichi is the branch manager in Kobe
Suketomo is their only son
you are late Father
how are things with Sayoko
i am only doing this for you
do not talk nonsense
i am with Sayoko
she will get her share for sure
Along with our share
it will be a huge sum
Right
Phone call for you Madam Umeko
Really
i see
here is Umeko
that was Matsuko
is she back
Always the big sister
such perfect timing
Takeko Umeko
Just the 2 of you
yes we did what you asked
something the matter
who is this
this is Sukekiyo
Mr Kindaichi
it is you
you are all dressed up where are you off to
the will is inside
i am off to the Inugami residence
they are all here
yes came back last night
Please come with me Mr Kindaichi
me
i told them you will replace Wakabayashi
they reluctantly agreed
i am so nervous i am shaking
Sorry to keep you waiting
this is Mr Yokomizo Kindaichi
last will of Testament
i am prepared to read you the will
but before that
i have a request for Madam Matsuko
this gentleman is he really Mr Sukekiyo
not that i doubt your word
but his face
what are you saying
are you implying someone is posing as Sukekiyo
no that is not what i mean
what does everyone else think
should i proceed
no
Umeko yes
what do you think
at least have him remove the mask and let us see his face
Naturally
Take off your mask Sukekiyo
when he was in the army
he was severely disfigured
that is why he wears a mask
we were detained because we had this mask custom made in Tokyo
do it for these heartless people
Remove your mask
that will do Sukekiyo
Mr Furutachi
are you satisfied
i am sure he is Sukekiyo
you have my word as his mother
Hurry and read the will
i understand
i shall begin
the symbols of the entire Inugami estate
the Axe the Koto and Chrysanthemum are entailed under the following conditions to Tamayo Nonomiya
what
to Tamayo
Regarding her spouse
she must choose from Mr Sahei Inugami 3 grandsons
Sukekiyo Suketake and Suketomo
she has the right to choose her husband
if she chooses not to marry any of the grandsons and marry someone else
she will lose her entire inheritance
in the event none of the grandsons wishes to marry Tamayo or at the time of death
they will lose their inheritance
Tamayo may choose to marry anyone she so desires
in the event Tamayo loses her inheritance or at the time of death
the grandsons will in proper order inherit the Inugami estate which will be equally divided into 5 shares
Sukekiyo Suketake and Suketomo will each inherit 1 share
the remaining 2 shares will be given to Kikuno Seisyo's son Sizuma
Kikuno Seisyo
in the event Tamayo
Sukekiyo Suketake and Suketomo are dead
the entire Inugami estate will go to Sizuma Sesiyo
in the event
Sizuma Sesiyo cannot be located
or if his death is confirmed
at the time all other successors are dead
the entire business and estate will be handled by the Inugami Foundation
this is a lie
a fake
someone is trying to steal the estate
this is not a fake
i have verified it as a lawyer
this cannot be real
the will is legally binding
we must act accordingly
what about us
we are his daughters
what kind of will is this
how dare you call yourself a lawyer
this girl with no blood relations cannot possibly inherit everything
we waited so long for something so absurd
how can we face Tamayo
i can not believe this is happening
this is outrageous
Hey
not only Tamayo
Seisyo and her son got a big share too
Shut up
do not bring that up
we have absolutely nothing to do with them
he left me out of the will
you are not the only one
what about me
do not get too excited
can you calm down
we must stay calm
if Suketake marries Tamayo
we will inherit everything
i am not reconciled to that
do not cry Sayoko
Takeko according to Koukichi's calculations
if Tamayo loses the inheritance
Suketomo's share of the estate amounts to almost 550 million
Even though one fifth sounds absurd
it is enough to buy you 5 or 6 high rises on the busiest street in Kobe
you are too naive
everything is likely to go to Tamayo
i want to know
Why is Sizuma Seisyo entitled to anything
Exactly
Mr Furutachi is right
the will is legally binding
when Father was around 50
that maid Seisyo bore him a bastard son
i can not stand to let her inherit anything
do not mind Seisyo
what about our mothers
that is right
if Sizuma is still alive
how old is he
Same age as Sukekiyo
we must curse Tamayo and Sizuma
that is too dangerous
i have been driving for 14 years
no i mean Miss Tamayo
to the members of the Inugami family
she is a thorn in their flesh
as long as she is alive
she decides who gets what
you mean someone wants to kill her
or the contrary
Contrary
if she hates them all
and is in love with someone else
and she doesn't want to lose the inheritance
Killing them is the only solution
i heard she had several accidents
Yesterday's boat incident was the 3rd one
yes
the killer posing as the victim is a very common thing
People in your line of work are always so suspicious
Human beings can not be so cold blooded
no
but someone has become just that
do not forget Mr Wakabayahsi is murdered
Mr Furutachi
Did Mr Wakabayashi love anyone
Come to think of it
he is secretly in love with Miss Tamayo
Miss Tamayo
before they go off to war
People would come here and leave their hand prints and pray for good luck
Why are we doing this
this can prove whether that stranger is Sukekiyo
Different people have different hand prints
i intend to check that man's print against this one
be our witness Mr Furutachi
to confirm Sukekiyo's print
that is why we invited you here
you are saying you do not think that is Sukekiyo
Naturally
but Madam Matsuko was so certain
you do not understand her
if Sukekiyo is dead
she will have nothing
Did you think of this
no the Head of the shrine did and contacted us
how thoughtful
i had actually forgotten about this
someone else reminded me
Sukekiyo left his print before his enlistment
who was that
Miss Tamayo
Excuse me
Remember this watch
it was broken
you fixed it for me
it broke down again during the war
since you were the only who can fix it
i have been waiting for you
can you help me
who is it
it is open
do you have a room
Aunt Matsuko
you object to Sukekiyo making a print
how many times must i tell you
Even if he is disfigured
he is definitely Sukekiyo
but
all the more reason to let him do it and put our minds to rest
what do you think Umeko
i agree
if you refuse you will arouse even more suspicion
Sukekiyo
Your mother may object
but this matters concerns you
will you do it
Sukekiyo is the most legitimate heir
in the olden days
he is the crown prince your master
now you are treating him like a criminal
i will never let him do something so ridiculous even if he wants to
Let's go Sukekiyo
Hey
do not run away
Please fill in your name and address
do it for me
me
i told you
i can not do that
all guests must do it themselves
this is the law since the Tenpo days
or perhaps from further back
the Tax department is very strict after the war
i must go by the book
can not you do it for me
i can not write
if he refuses that means he is an impostor
do not scare me
it fell out when i opened the door
you gave me such a scare
how is it possible he can not write
i left the log book with him
he is weird
Maybe there is a scar on his face
he never took off the scarf
Did he pay
that is suspicious
you going out
it is late where are you going
Going out
Come over at once
Wakabayashi was right
something happened
you can not go in
Mr Kindaichi
Mr Furutachi what happened
Please come this way
Enzo made the chrysanthemum mannequins
it was Master Sahei's hobby
Enzo makes it every year
it is from the puppet play
the chrysanthemum field in the 3rd act
can you tell Mr Kindaichi
they resemble the family members
that is a human head
is that Suketake
who discovered him
Enzo
Enzo
Calm down Takeko
do not be like this Mother
do not
i have to go see Suketake
do not be ridiculous
Mother
i want revenge
i want to kill the killer
no wonder Takeko has gone mad
Why put the head here
that is a lot of work
the Police needs the living room
this is so disturbing
Suketake met with such a brutal death
everyone is at a loss
i forgot to tell you something
what is it
the young man with the mask
we can not confirm if he is Sukekiyo
you mean comparing the prints
Suketake suggested it
Matsuko was furious
and they started arguing
if that Sukekiyo is an impostor
he is afraid Suketake will suspect him
Am i right Commissioner
the thought of it scares me
i did not want to bring it up
but it is best you know about it
Inoue
Thanks for your help
you may go
a family feud
she is just a nag nothing else
the scene of the crime should be the terrace
we assume the killer chopped off Suketake's head and threw the body into the lake
we must retrieve the body
that is easy for you to say
Algae from the bottom of the lake are entangling like a woman's hair
you won't find anything
oh right
Mr Furutachi
Suketake and Wakabayashi's deaths are related to the will
we must know its content
Please hand it over as part of the evidence
Alright
Forensics
how many are here
i found this on the floor
you recognize this brooch
yes
whose is it
i think it is Miss Tamayo's
Miss Tamayo
Maybe she dropped it before last night
when we discussed the prints last night
she was still wearing it
i remember that clearly
Madam Mastuko needs me
yes
about the prints
she has agreed to let Sukekiyo do it
we want you there as a witness
she was against it yesterday
how strange
everyone is here
Sukekiyo will make a print
you will all be his witness
last time i found the idea absurd
so i was dead set against it
but Suketake has been murdered
and people suspect
Sukekiyo and i killed him
who would do such a thing
they may not speak it
but the thought has crossed their minds
that is why Sukekiyo volunteered to do this
that will do Madam Matsuko
i will pass it to the Police for verification
is this your brooch
yes
where did you find it
at the scene of the crime
i
i asked you here
Sorry i am late
you never asked for me
i am a bit surprised
this watch has Sukekiyo's finger prints
Compare this with the hand print
i did not expect you to help us
i just want to clear things up as soon as possible
i am sorry to bother you
but you can use the finger prints
i will get on it tomorrow
you do not think that man is Sukekiyo
Good night
Miss Tamayo
can we talk
there is nothing to talk about
Among the 3 of us
who will you choose
i have always liked you
not because of the inheritance
i haven't decided goodbye
Miss Tamayo
do not
you will be mine
if you do that again i will kill you
i was terrified
Enzo escorted me from the terrace
is that it
yes
Did you call the Police
yes
the body was moved to Guanyin Cape in a boat that belongs to the family
we found the tools used to cut off the head
the boat bears the Inugami symbol
Enzo is in charge of the boat house
when he was questioned
he did not mention any missing boats
this should be the key to the boat house
he discovered the human head
he was also the last one to see Suketake alive
Tamayo's statement was ambiguous
and there were no witnesses
what is their relationship
the late Master Sahei brought him home 10 years ago
he was enlisted in the war
Nobody knows his background
Master Sahei ordered him to guard Tamayo with his life
this is what Enzo told the other servants
if Tamayo asks him he will kill for her
Tamayo and Enzo
i get it
they are the killers
Follow them yes
Mr Furutachi
any word on the hand prints
i am still waiting
there is something else Commissioner
Innkeeper
here
yes
when did the masked man leave
around 5 o'clock
Show me the guest log
the log
yes
what is this
Sanpei Yamada
yes
this handwriting is awful
he did not write it
Did you
no
my wife did
hello
what are you doing here
we must think alike
the blood stained boat was abandoned at the Cape
i came to check the neighborhood
and i found this inn
Sorry to interrupt
do you still need me
no Right
if there was a man in army uniform
the investigation may take a different turn
i thought the case was related to the will
the killer must be from within the family
now it can be an outsider
the veteran was at the inn between 8 to 10pm last night
during that time the Inugami family was busy with the prints
Looks like there are 2 masked men 2
Sorry to keep you waiting
this is Mr Fujisaki from Forensics
we have the results
Please begin Mr Fujisaki
i am here to disclose the results
i will omit the technical terms and get to the point
These 2 prints are identical
therefore this gentleman is without a doubt Mr Sukekiyo
this is solid proof
Did you hear that
any more questions
i do not think so
that is to say
you acknowledge he is Sukekiyo
Mr Furutachi and this gentleman
Thank you for your help
this is rationed
Thank you
you like to smoke
yes
what about Madam Matsuko and Takeko
they all do why
nothing
Something's wrong with Mother
you are all tired
we only keep vigil till midnight
Please get some rest
Let's go
Sure
a word with you Miss Tamayo
Want some tea
i prefer something sweet
Let's talk in my room
no we will do it here
what is it you wish to say
about my brother
i heard he saw you before he was killed
what did you talk about
i told the Police everything
i do not care about my brother
i do not want you to choose Suketomo
now there are only 2 candidates
one has a face too ugly to look at
Naturally i am worried
i am pregnant
Really
with Suketomo's child
Listen to me
if you choose Suketomo
i will hate you forever
what is it
i saw someone
he jumped from the balcony
Maybe it is a thief
what was that
it is Sukekiyo
is he dead
may i
is he dead
no he is unconscious
someone knocked him out
the estimated time of death is between 11 pm and midnight
the cause of death is a fatal wound into the chest from the back
what about the murder weapon
something sharp like scissors
Scissors
the kind with a heavy handle like shears
Only women use shears
Find the owner
the killer used the shears to kill
and chopped off the head with an axe
the killer must have prepared both weapons
i think 2 people used different weapons
there are 2 killers
Just an assumption
by the way
Did you find the watch on the body
no although Tamayo said she gave it to Suketake
it must be a lie
a pretty girl like that won't lie
People are either good or bad
i thought we agreed
you are not to come here again
Yet you called
i am so sorry
the family has become the center of attention
you must have heard
must be tough on you
then you should leave me alone
i heard Takeko and Umeko are still supporting their mothers
that is their business
Take this and leave
i will do as you say
i am afraid
this is the last time we will see each other
Take care
Inugami family
are you finished
yes it was delicious
i made them myself
what is the best
Raw eggs
that is too much
the Sahei Inugami Story
after the Sino Japanese and Russo Japanese wars as well as the World War i
Inugami Pharmaceuticals had exceptional growth
i want to know the secret
is it related to the case
Probably
Mr Furutachi
the secret of the Sahei Inugami Story
what is the secret
i am not too sure
i do not want to bring it up
do you want more victims
there will be more killings
Hard to say
but very likely
Poppy
the foundation of Inugami Pharmaceuticals is this special root mixed with other drugs
Sahei Inugami was familiar with poppy
Perhaps that was before he came here and started the family
he founded the company at age of 23
he planted poppy at the beginning
you should know
you can extract drugs from poppy
Like opium morphine and heroin
it is illegal to grow poppy
Sahei Inugami used his connections and got permission to purchase huge quantities of these drugs
for our military
Inugami drugs were as effective as bombs and firearms on the battlefront
that was most unfortunate
Wars are brutal
there you are
i have been looking for you
something the matter
Kindaichi is here with the Commissioner
it appears to be something important
we are to meet in the living room
Come
Really
Alright
who is it
Speak up
who is there
Help
Shears
yes
According to the servants
you have borrowed Madam Takeko's shears
can i take a look
yes
Well
i wanted to put flowers in Suketake's memorial hall
but i could not find it
it was there then
the day Suketake was killed
what happened to the shears
we have confirmed
a pair of shears killed Suketake
you think i am the killer
that is unforgivable
Please calm down Madam Umeko
the murder of the Inugami family is no longer a local matter
but one of national interest
so
we need your help in this investigation
but i need your help with my life
Mr Enzo
is this Enzo
yes
Miss Tamayo is now in the empty house inside the village
she is unconscious
Fetch her now
do not tell anyone
Go now
Haru
oh
i have been waiting for you
are you hungry
Eat all you want
Sorry to bother you
i am glad you know a college professor
Did you see him
yes
what kind of poison is this
Using acetic acid to create an alkaloid compound
someone laced the cigarettes with poison
to come up with special white crystals
Special
Did the professor explain this
it is probably a plant extract
he needs more time to get a detail analysis
i see
Please
Did he mention poppy
the main ingredient is morphine
yes there are traces of it
Really
Please
you are not eating
i do not have time
Really
Bill please
you have been a great help
a professor of pharmacology among the regulars of Nasu Inn
does he go there often
Let me no
i insist on paying
that won't be necessary
i will get my fees
i am sorry
since last year
i need to use the bathroom more often
Really
shall i start from the beginning
Please
Well
how can she play with a death in the family
where is Suketomo
he is late
when you inhale the poison and the smoke
it will irritate the lungs
and rupture the veins resulting in instant death
that is why the poison is not in the stomach but in the lungs
Wakabayashi did not die from food poison
but from inhaling the poison
you are working hard on the case
yes
you are on the wrong track
no this is the way to resolve the case
where have you been
Sukekiyo
i heard you have left the army
must be rough on you
Sorry i did not send my regards
i heard about what happened
do not be too sad
Thank you
those rumors are awful
the newspapers reports are out of line
Blind people like me are spared from such troubles
Perhaps i am the lucky one
it is 4 o'clock
Wake up
Suketomo is not back yet
i am worried
Sayoko
Morning
Suketomo hasn't been back
i haven't seen him since yesterday afternoon
we should call the Police
i thought you hate the Police
that is a separate matter
he is not a mouse
he can not possibly hide in here
Calm down
Please do not cry Aunt Umeko
this is awful
Please perform the autopsy
this is not the scene of the crime
the body has been moved again
Look
None of the tiles are broken
Commissioner
a string from a koto
he is strangled by a string
no maybe just a camouflage
first chrysanthemum now koto
what does that mean
i can not believe Suketomo is dead
Hard to believe
you were the last one to see Suketake alive
and now this
this is not good
the Police will suspect you
i want to make sure Miss Tamayo
Suketomo covered your nose on the boat
you do not remember anything afterwards
i vaguely remember someone yelling
Like they were arguing
was there someone else
could that be the killer
not necessarily
it is your fault Commissioner
when you foolishly suspect i was the killer
my dear Suketomo is being killed
you have an obligation to me to catch this killer
must be Tamayo
do not jump to conclusions
you can not interfere with the investigation
you believe that girl
my Suketomo will never resort to using chloroform
i know because i am his Mother
Tamayo is lying to protect herself
but a girl can not move the body to the roof
then it must be Enzo
Matsuko
you must be relieved
Suketake and Suketomo are dead
Only Sukekiyo is left
you will get your wish
Commissioner
i heard there was a string on Suketomo's neck
is that true
but the actual weapon is something much thicker
first is chrysanthemum then koto
Axe chrysanthemum and koto
what does that mean
Matsuko
to avenge Suketake and Suketomo
we must bring that up
i can not stand it anymore
such an evil horrible incident
i must reveal the family scandal
we all have different mothers
Father was never legally married
our mothers sole purpose was to satisfy Father's sexual desire
when he was 52 or 53
he had the audacity to impregnate the maid
that girl Kikuno gave him a son
and Father gave her the 3 family treasures
an axe koto and chrysanthemum
that is absurd
that is unforgivable
we decided to teach Kikuno a lesson
and retrieve the treasures
we found Kikuno on a farm
i curse you
i will take revenge some day
Kikuno was crying when she swore to take revenge
Madam Takeko thinks this is related to the murders
they were merciless
never cross a woman
Mr Furutachi
what became of Kikuno and her son
she went to Toyama and stayed with relatives
she died in an air raid
her life is so tragic
i heard Sizuma enlisted in the army
and was never heard from again
i get it
the veteran is Sizuma
he is the killer
he wants the inheritance to himself so he sets out to kill the others
Inoue
Send out a warrant for his arrest
Axe koto and chrysanthemum
the last Head of the Shrine Taiji Nonomiya first came up with the names
and made an axe koto and chrysanthemum in gold
they became shrine treasures
when Sahei Inugami started his business
Mr Nonomiya gave them to him as a present
but they remained in the shrine for safe keeping
yes
Axe koto and chrysanthemum
Axe koto and chrysanthemum
they were supposed to guard the shrine
now they have become a curse
the axe is left
you think there will be another murder
where was old Mr Inugami born
it is unknown
he was a drifter
he was 17 when he arrived at Nasu
he passed out in front of the shrine
like a hungry dog
Mr Nonomiya saved his life
the money he needed to start the business also came from Mr Nonomiya
Taiji Nonomiya and Sahei Inugami's fates have since then become one
are they homosexuals
where did you hear that
from Mr Furutachi
how is this related to the case
Mr Oyama
are you related to the Nonomiya family
we are distant relatives
how long have you been here
15 years
Mr Oyama
to prevent further tragedies
Please tell me everything you know including the smallest incidents about the Inugamis and the Nonomiyas
Miss Tamayo is Mr Inugami's granddaughter
from these chests in the Nasu Shrine warehouse
there are old documents
i did not believe it at first about Miss Tamayo's secret identity
i kept my mouth shut and never told anyone
until now yes
i used to love old books
and you
no
i was going through these chests
and i found out the unusual relationship between Taiji Nonomiya and Master Sahei
Even though Nonomiya was married
he was unable to consummate the relationship with his wife
so he was very fond of Master Sahei
his virginal wife Haruyo eventually had an affair with Master Sahei
when Nonomiya found out
he gave them his blessing and encouraged them to be together
Why would he do that
Perhaps to make it up to Haruyo for what he failed to give her
or he was afraid how people will judge him
he could not divorce his wife and be with Master Sahei openly
According to Master Sahei's diary
that period was most painful to him
he respected Taiji Nonomiya and truly loved Madam Haruyo
they later had a daughter Kanko
Taiji Nonomiya treated Kanko as his own
when Kanko got married
she gave birth to Miss Tamayo
Master Sahei loved Miss Tamayo and was very fond of her
because she is his granddaughter
the tycoon who dominated Shinshu
led a secret life
Mr Furutachi
i have a feeling the multiple murders at hand is a result of Master Sahei's will power
Mr Kindaichi
he passed away 7 months ago
how is that possible
you are right this is preposterous
what is wrong with me
the only woman he loved was the wife of his benefactor
he let off his long suppressed emotions through money women power
and other human desires and vices
he ruined many lives
Madam Kikuno
the Inugami sisters and their mothers
Matsuko go back inside
we must say goodbye
do not worry about me
Your Father gave me a lot of money
i have to go
you will soon grow up
Mr Furutachi
where is Madam Matsuko's mother
i haven't seen her for 7 or 8 years
Mr Oyama saw her recently in the neighborhood
i think her name is Ozono
Beyond those hills is where her brother lives
but she doesn't go there often
Make up your mind Miss Tamayo
Suketake and Suketomo are dead
Sukekiyo is your only choice for a husband
i want to know your decision
you are not talking
you have no other choice
i refuse
what
do you know what you are saying
if you refuse to marry Sukekiyo
you will lose your inheritance
you do not care
Say something Miss Tamayo
Auntie this man is not Sukekiyo
Sukekiyo
Mother
i am Sukekiyo
Alright
where have you been
i have been looking for you
i want to talk to you
the warehouse is fine
how can you not be my son
Tamayo is lying
i do not know anymore
Say something Sukekiyo
she is right
Your beloved Sukekiyo has disappeared
who are you
i am Sizuma Seisyo
you and your sisters have tortured and humiliated my mother
i am Kikuno Seisyo's son Sizuma
my mother died when i was 9
she cursed you on her death bed
you and your whole family
i promised myself
i will take my revenge
i will avenge my Mother
because of a sad twist of fate
when i enlisted in the army
i met Sukekiyo in the battlefield in Burma
i approached him
and promised to let bygones be bygones
we are of the same height and build
and we got along well
Your son was a good man
when the war escalated
our troops were separated
his unit was wiped out
i managed to stay alive despite my disfigurement
Even my voice changed
the hatred towards your family kept me alive
i decided to pose as Sukekiyo because i wanted the Inugami estate
it seems like a game i will enjoy
Dip it in the water again
is that Sukekiyo's body
yes the head was chopped by an axe
it is now complete
Axe koto and chrysanthemum 3 different methods of murder
it happened again
Sukekiyo was murdered
where have you been
it is not important anymore
Commissioner can you get the dead man's hand print and finger prints
Finger prints
that is what Miss Tamayo said
she did
the hand prints matched last time
that is the problem
Well
this is odd
this is a totally different print
he is not Sukekiyo
you can say that
they swapped
what
Using the mask
the real Sukekiyo swapped with the impostor
whose body did we just find
Probably Sizuma
Really
i get it
the veteran at the inn is the killer
Sukekiyo
Stay back
i am the killer
i killed Suketake Suketomo and Sizuma
Sukekiyo i
i am a wanted criminal i probably won't get away
i am prepared
Say no more
i intended to die in battle
i did not care
but i wanted to see you
Leave the family Tamayo
Forget everything and start a new life
Understand
Mr Kindaichi
you did not come back to the inn
yes
where are you going now
i am going out
to work on the case
Let me come with you
i want to go with you
i am in a hurry
See you later
are you following me
Long time no see
no wonder you are upset
it is my fault Miss Tamayo became a murder suspect
but do not worry
i will disappear soon enough
what are you doing
Sukekiyo
i am sorry to bother you
i heard Sukekiyo showed up
my Confession
Sukekiyo Inugami
Did he write this
Please take a look
i do not want to turn this in to the Police
i Sukekiyo Inugami committed the recent murders
this is my confession
this is his way of saying goodbye
i think so too
Miss Tamayo
you know the body in the lake is not Sukekiyo
i may make a mistake with anyone else but not Sukekiyo
Let me keep this for now
what happened Enzo
is it Sukekiyo
Did you write this
you threatened Sizuma to help you kill Suketake and Suketomo
and you offered him a share of the estate
Right
yes
you killed Sizuma because you can not agree on the terms
no
you intended to kill Sizuma all along
can not be
it was Sizuma who threatened you
Sukekiyo
you can not possibly kill everyone
in Wakabayashi's case
he died on September 19th
you came home on the 20th
i did not kill Wakabayashi
i am only responsible for the Inugami murders
Did you hear that Commissioner
Sukekiyo admitted he was the veteran who showed up at the inn in the middle of the night
when you arrived at Hakata
you read about the impostors from the papers
with an intention to swap with him and pretending that nothing had happened
you showed up at the inn in a mask
you left the inn at 10pm that night
Snuck inside the house to look for the impostor
you were right
Sizuma was the impostor
but since Sizuma was disfigured
you could not swap back
then Suketake showed up and you went into hiding
when Miss Tamayo came
Things happened the way she described it
after she left with Enzo
Suketake was murdered
and you witnessed it
you saw the killer
you mean this man is not the killer
you want to protect the killer
so you wrote the confession and took action
but paper can not hold fire
Only if you tell us the truth can you save the killer
Madam Matsuko is the killer right
it is Kindaichi
Come in
Excuse me
what do you want
can you tell me whether the body in the lake is Sukekiyo
the Police called this morning
Madam Matsuko Sukekiyo is in custody
where is he
Sukekiyo is suspected of 3 murders
that is absurd
Sukekiyo is not a killer
that is right he is not
because you are
what prove do you have against me
you told Mr Wakabayashi to read the will
me
Wakabayashi took your money
but got scared after he read the will
and came to me for help
Shut up
so you silenced him
who do you think you are
what right do you have
you are not the Police
i was in Hakata when Wakabayashi died
i was perplexed by that too
Killers often arrange for their own alibi
to kill Mr Wakabayashi at will
you laced poison and went away
if i knew about the will
i would not be so surprised when it was announced
i went to see your Mother at Iwagi Village
i wanted to know more about Master Sahei Inugami
but i found out something else
Your Mother saw you when you gave cigarettes to Mr Wakabayashi
you paid your Mother off
when you went to Hakata
she saw you at the Nasu station
i have cut off relations with her
she is no longer my mother
Who'd believe her
after you killed Wakabayashi
you went after Suketake
you did not know
Sukekiyo was on the terrace that night
Sukekiyo
he was with Sizuma
Sukekiyo
after you left Sizuma promised Sukekiyo
he would not expose you as long as Sukekiyo followed his orders
from then onwards
Sukekiyo has reluctantly become Sizuma's slave
i am doing this to save your Mother
a woman is too weak to chop off a human head
when you saw Suketake's head on the mannequin
you were probably more surprised than anyone else
Even the killer doesn't know the accomplice
but the accomplice took care of the bodies
that is the most unusual thing about these murders
you and your sisters were left out of the will
in order to force Miss Tamayo to marry Sukekiyo
you murdered these people
but you did not realize
Miss Tamayo is Master Sahei's granddaughter
Miss Tamayo's mother is the daughter of
Master Sahei and Haruyo Nonomiya
i have a feeling
Maser Sahei is somehow using you to make his dream come true
Tamayo is not the descendant of Nonomiya
Impossible
Let me see Sukekiyo
Sukekiyo
Sukekiyo
Mother
you are safe
it is wonderful
when your unit was wiped out in Burma
i lost all hope to live
i prayed to the Gods not to take you and let you live
my prayers have been answered
i did not expect to see you again
it has been 5 years
i will never forget that day in the rain when you joined the Matsumoto unit
if you are alive
Why did not you come home
because of my mistake my unit was wiped out
i was too ashamed to come home
i missed you so much in Hakata
i made the most ridiculous mistake
i mistook Sizuma for you
you must forgive me
a twist of fate
a terrible twist of fate
a recurring terrible twist of fate
i can not believe Matsuko is the killer
i do not believe it
Please explain yourself Commissioner
i am not over reacting
but this is too absurd too horrible
i can barely speak
Calm down Umeko
how can i
Matsuko killed your son too
Madam Matsuko is most unfortunate
Why must we suffer such horrible fates
Please calm down
Under Mr Kindaichi's persuasion
Madam Matsuko calmed down when she saw Sukekiyo
we should go see her
it started out as a twist of fate
but when they keep recurring and overlap
to take advantage of it requires high intelligence
the kind Sizuma was trained for in the army
because it is a must on the battlefront
because of the hand print
Sizuma was afraid he will be exposed as an impostor
so he ordered Sukekiyo to swap with him that night
Sukekiyo stayed behind wearing the mask
Sizuma put on the army uniform
and disposed of the headless corpse
he abandoned the boat at Guanyin Cape and returned to the inn in Sukekiyo's place
when the print was made the next day
Obviously they matched
the night they swapped again
before that day
it did occur to me that man was not Sukekiyo
but when the prints matched
i was really happy
Even for a split second
i should never doubt my son
when my koto teacher came that night
something happened and i lost myself again
or perhaps someone was controlling me
that is ruthless
my poor Suketomo
do not cry
after the fight
Suketomo was exhausted
that is cruel
he snuck back into the house
Sukekiyo and Sizuma moved him to the roof
yes
Why did you call Enzo asking him to escort Miss Tamayo home but instead you came back here
i was worried about Tamayo
what about the string
Sizuma said it is the curse of the 3 treasures
after chrysanthemum he must use the string
According to the koto teacher
when Madam Matsuko was playing
the teacher said
after playing for 4 or 5 years
you can already hear chaos from the sound of the koto
there was a death in the family
Yet she still wanted her lesson
that was the first questionable point
at first she played well
but after the break
i realized her index finger was wounded
Yet she tried to hide it and finished the song in pain
that was particularly strange
i was determined to pose as Sukekiyo
and take the entire estate
everything will be mine
Tamayo the inheritance everything
i won
i have beaten the Inugami family
Did you leave Sizuma's body in the lake
Takeko
Umeko
Please forgive me
i had no choice
Father had us but not out of love
i hate him
but i can not escape his legacy
the night we kept vigil for Suketake
who snuck into Miss Tamayo's room
Sizuma
Why
he found out about Miss Tamayo's plan
and wanted to steal the watch
but Suketake did not have it on him
i did not know about the finger prints
the watch fell out when his body hit the ground
i picked it up
when you killed Suketake and Suketomo
did not you think of the consequences
all i wanted was to get them out of the way
Whether i will get caught or a death sentence
i simply did not care
will Sukekiyo be found guilty
Probably
Regardless of his reasons
he was an accomplice after the fact
how heavy is his penalty
i do not know
Death penalty
Unlikely
the judge will use his discretion
Miss Tamayo
will you wait for Sukekiyo
i will
if he wants me to
that is wonderful
you put a hole in Miss Tamayo's boat
and read the will right
Sukekiyo
Free Tamayo from your grandfather's legacy
Damn
she laced the cigarettes with the same poison that killed Wakabayashi
Say goodbye to Mr Kindaichi for me
i am going
it is still early
3 500 is your fee 427 is your allowance
Thank you
i will count it Please
Thanks for your help Mr Kindaichi
i will give you a receipt
that is not necessary
i must
may i borrow this
Please
here is some money
it is a token of my appreciation
i can not take that do not say that
no
Please accept it
such an incredible case
i doubt if the Police alone would have been able to crack this case
Thanks for your help
if i knew about the crux of this case
it would not have claimed 5 lives
i am very sorry
Please forgive me
Really
that is such a shame
the Commissioner and Miss Tamayo
and the waitress wish to see you off
i will be there of course
oh no
i hate goodbyes
it is so distressing
when is the earlier train
how can you do this
Furutachi Law Offices

Thanks for everything

and reactor number four became one with the air

Vaporized
it exploded
i am sorry what does that mean
Nature has reclaimed its rightful home
here we are
Welcome to Pripyat

be careful
Careful
Bye teacher we will bring our presents this afternoon
Bye children
do not get into mischief
Bye
Bye
i will race you to Elsie's
Let's see
the children have been flitting all over the place
Place is messy enough as it is
Good morning dear
Good morning Walter
everything packed
i think so
but i will probably get home
and find out i have left behind me all that is really important
and i am going to miss you
Thanks
oh let me see
Hardly know where to begin the place is such a muddle
might as well finish this
i never did like these rugs anyway
i think i will get some new ones
oh uhh uhh
See pull it on that side
Let me help
Thank you
there must be some system to this
now you can stand on them and i can sweep them
and we'd both wind up on the floor
no thanks
besides you will be late for your train
are you watching the time
yes i have plenty of time
and i hate waiting rooms
Well you can not sit around
Why do you suppose i waited for you to go on your vacation
before i started cleaning house
you are the most disorganized woman i ever knew
you think you will ever get all this back together again
i hope so
i have a man coming to help me
Good
Where'd you find him
Came looking for work yesterday
oh do not spread it dear
Dust
what is the sense in dusting all of them
Seems to me you make a lot of extra work for yourself
Why do not you have each person who wants to read a book
Dust it himself
hello Mr Armstrong
Morning Ruthie
hello Aunt Helen
Morning Ruth
Well what hit this place
i thought you were going on your vacation
she put me to work
Why are you here so early
i am being punished
Dad and Mother went over to the Ellisons for the day
i am supposed to help you
on a Saturday too
do not tell me you were out late again last night
not after all you went through with your Mother last week
i am not a child
Look who is not a child
Lots of girls my age are married and have children
oh i would not say lots
had your breakfast
yes thanks
Good
then supposing you get right to work
do not i even get a chance to catch my breath
no
you can do that while you dust the shades
Ohh
i am just a slave anyway
Ruth dear
Exactly how long did your mother say i was to punish you today
Just work me to the bone i suppose
i see
Well at the rate we are going i do not think we will get to the bone till next Fall
Just cause i was out late last night
Parents are so insensitive
we had such a beautiful evening planned
i will never be able to face Tom
when he finds out i have been ordered to stay home tonight
Just like a child
it is Tom now
oh dear whatever happened to Larry
i thought he was the big love of your life
Larry just was not for me
Found that out when i met Tom
you have been out of touch with men for so long Aunt Helen
you would not understand
oh i do not know
my poor old memory is not that dim
oh wonder if i have got everything
um Ruth i really do not think you ought to stay here and help me anymore today
you mean i can go home
no
Come here
i want you to deliver these packages to the school for the party this evening
Nice lot of them
See that you deliver them
when you have finished
i want you to drop this box of old clothes at the church for me
i guess everybody wants me to die of exhaustion
do not you think that is too much to ask a woman of her advanced age
Guess this will fill up my whole day
oh no
i want you to come back when you are through
Perhaps by then i will have found a large wash for you to do or something
that is sweet of you
Good bye Mr Armstrong
i hope you have a nice Christmas
Thanks Ruthie
Good bye
oh peace at last
' Tis nice is not it
oh yes
now i can finish the rest of my Christmas packages
i have uh
yes
i have something to straighten out with you
now this this should take care of my room for two more weeks should not it
and as i told you if Mr Frank shows up
you can let him have it while i am away
then you won't be alone in the house
i will be all right thanks
but i do not expect any telephone calls
you have my forwarding address and i am going to miss that room
Ned liked that room too
he kept writing about how much he missed it while he was in the service
i
Heavens what time is it
oh plenty of time
i have nearly an hour
you are not that early and you know it
now hurry along or you will really be late
oh all right
i wish i could send you a box of snow from where i am going
so do i
oh let me help you
Well i haven't heard Corky bark in ages
Wonder what is the matter with him
he decided he is going to be a watchdog
Corky come here
Stop that
Corky
Come here
Stop that
Corky
that is the man i hired
Ha ha ha
i believe he is afraid of Corky
he could not be
now hurry or you are going to miss that train
Corky you bad dog
Up
Come here
that a boy
i am sorry
i do not know what is come over him
Glad you are here
the name is
Howard Wilton ma'am
that is right
Howard Wilton
Mr Armstrong
i am glad to meet you
i know you are going to be a great help to Mrs Gordon
i hope to be
i tried to make friends with him
oh he just doesn't trust strangers
i am sorry
Well nice meeting you
Good bye Helen
Good bye dear
and drop me a card won't you
i will do that
Good bye Corky
See him off to the gate Corky
Go on
oh my
Sorry i am late
oh that is all right
there is so much to do
oh yes the wreath
here
Thank you
where does it go
uh right over the door
Thank you
the dog was not here when i came yesterday
no
he runs off all the time
Haven't seen a dog yet that liked me
you probably imagine they do not like you
that looks nice
you ever owned one
no
Better come inside and get started now
oh give me your coat and i will hang it here in the closet
Thank you
where shall i put this
oh i will take it
now let me see
oh yes i think I'd like the floors waxed first
Floors are my specialty
Maybe i do not work as fast as others but when i have finished
you know they have really been polished
that is good
Well i will get the waxing things
you should not carry that
it is too heavy
Thank you
you should have let me get it
oh i am used to carrying it
Well you won't carry it anymore
now uh oh yes why do not you put the rugs on the front lawn and then they will be out of your way
all right
Need any help Mrs Gordon
no thanks
i am just getting some boxes
Mrs Gordon if you do not mind
I'd like to take my coat somewhere else
Your coat
yes
you see i did not know it was a storage closet
it might get dirty
it is my only coat
oh well i have a cedar closet upstairs
you can put it there if you like
yes
Soon as i get rid of these i will take it up
if you will tell me where the closet is i will take it up
oh it is the first door on the right at the top of the stairs
would not want you running upstairs on my account
Operator 4892 please
yes thank you
uh hello
this is Mrs Gordon
would you get Mr Anderson for me
hello Mr Anderson
uh i have got quite a Christmas list for you
Thank you
Very well then
i will expect him
Late this afternoon
oh thank you
i appreciate it
Bye
would you like me to help you trim the tree
oh no thank you
i just wanted to look at them
i really think we should get on with the work now
Mrs Gordon
yes
you are not dissatisfied with the work i am doing are you
Why no
so far you are doing very well
then you weren't
Telephoning anybody about me were you
Why no
Why should i
besides who would i call
i do not need any references
i was just phoning about some groceries
you see i am very anxious to make good on this job
i always try to do my best
i work very hard but nobody realizes it
i get paid but
Howard what is the matter
i am sorry
that is all right
Something's troubling you is not it
would you like to tell me about it
no it is nothing
oh now haven't you ever been troubled and talked things over with one of your friends
i haven't any friends
Just because you work for me is no reason why we can not be friends
yes it is
Why
because i will only be here for today Mrs Gordon
i will clean your house do my job and be gone and forgotten as far as you are concerned and looking for the next job wherever that is
oh now that is not necessarily true
Why you might fit in here very nicely
i like you
you need the work and i certainly need someone to help me
you mean maybe i could come back
yes we might even have a regular day every week perhaps even two
oh that would be fine
but it won't work out that way
oh why not
this will be just like all the other jobs
most people only have me once or at best twice
Perhaps they can not afford it
Why do they have me in the first place
Well
Please forgive me for saying this
it is really none of my business
but you know if you keep things too long within yourself you forget how to share your troubles with others
you shut everyone away from you as you are doing now
do not you see
what i am trying to say is
i know what it is to be lonely too
i think I'd better get on with my work
of course
i did not mean to offend you
i know you did not
if you need anything i will be upstairs
Just call me
Aunt Helen
what who are you
Howard Wilton
what are you doing here
Working
where is my Aunt
Upstairs
oh
Aunt Helen i am back
what do i have to do now
nothing dear
Just go home
you will only be in my way
Thank you
Well that is that
i am starved
how about you
no
Want some potato chips
Nope
i am glad Aunt Helen finally found herself
a nice looking man to have around the house
Did you see Mr Armstrong
yes
not much huh
i said to Aunt Helen only the other day if you are going to have a man around at least have a lively one
after all just' cause you are a widow
Doesn't mean you have to turn yourself into an old maid
Good heavens Uncle Ned's been dead almost two years
but i guess once you have been married you can not ever be an old maid again
not exactly
can you
i know one thing
Aunt Helen won't be quite so lonely anymore with you around
not very talkative are you
Gee when i see nice shiny floors like this i feel like dancing
do you like to dance
no
do you know how
no
Maybe you'd like to learn
no i would not
i do not know when i have had less cooperation in my entire life
you think i am funny
not particularly
i do not like being laughed at
Well are not you the bundle of nerves
Listen you i do not see many men around polishing floors
it is a woman's job
who do you think you are
it seems to me there is better ways for a man to make a living
oh Howard Howard
how long have you been watching me Mrs Gordon
what are you talking about
would you like me to work faster
is that what you want
are you well
are you well enough to work
yes of course i am
Big hero is not he
that is my husband
he was killed during the war
Killed
yes
oh i see
now it all fits
i am alive and he is dead
it should be the other way around
is not that what you think
how can you say such things
because it is true that is why
you are ill
Let's put the work away
Put the work away
now you do not want me to do the job is that it
you are just like the army
there was a job to be done there too but they would not let me in
now you want me to stop in the middle of this
i think you have said enough
You'd better leave
i will pay you for the time you have put in
how dare you
you are not going to make me feel weak the way they did
that room full of men
i was just as strong just as good as they were
i failed
and they offered me coffee and donuts
Tried to tell me they were doing it all for my own good that i was not well
while the others were signing up
i had to sit there like a tired old man and sip coffee
i am sorry
that is all right
i am tired
yes i know
i understand
i really think you should go home now
i do not know where my home is
you do not know
no
where did you come from when you arrived here this morning
i do not know
i told you i forget things
but you must have a home
a room someplace
no
sometimes when i start out in the morning
i say to myself remember to come back here tonight this is where you live but i can not remember
i can not remember
Well do not worry
Between us we will we will straighten out everything
will we
yes of course
we can call the
there are places we can call
no do not call
Why not
they will ask questions questions that i would not be able to answer
but do not you understand
if anyone questions you it would only be in an effort to help you
no do not call
but Howard you are ill
it would be sensible to get
no
that is what i have been trying to tell you
i have had enough of them
Please do not get any doctors around here they would not understand
not the way you do
you understand
i can feel it i can
Mrs Gordon
yes
have i done anything to hurt you
no of course you haven't
i am glad
because i would not want to hurt you
but i might you know
i do not believe that
you are just not feeling well that is all
you do not know what it means like i do to find myself in the middle of a room or the middle of a busy street or in some house i am working in
when a thing like that happens
i wonder where i am what i am doing
and sometimes i am
looking down at someone somebody that is been hurt
they have been hurt very badly
and i wonder if i have done it if what i am looking at is real or it is only in my mind
then i begin to run
i hide
but i do not know what i am hiding from
it is bad enough to hide but not to know what you are hiding from
there are days when i pick up a newspaper and i see that somebody's been murdered
and i ask myself could i have been there at that time
could i have done this thing
where was i yesterday
what causes these blank spaces
what causes them
i do not know
i do not know
Perhaps perhaps if we get a doctor
i told you i have had enough of doctors
Just tell me one thing do you know what started things going wrong this morning
no i do not
i remember something about a man being here
was there a man here
yes
what was his name
Mr Armstrong
he rooms here
oh yes
i remember
he is the one who started it all
what do you mean
i was coming up the walk there was a dog barking and he was standing right here
he was laughing at me
he was not
Really he was not
oh yes he was and you know he was
Howard you are imagining things
no
he had a suitcase in his hand and his overcoat over his arm
where are you going
to let him in of course
he can not harm you
Please Howard
all right
where is the key
Wherever you put it i suppose
i never lock the doors from the inside during the daytime
Give me the key
i do not have your key
yes you have
i tell you i do not have your key
Very well
i will let him in the back way
where is your roomer now Mrs Gordon
is he coming back soon
yes
yes he is coming back
Why he should be here any minute
Good
then i can ask him if he was laughing at me when i arrived this morning
i would not wait for him if i were you
there might be trouble
Trouble
he won't like it when he finds you have locked me in this house
what do you mean
Try the door
you have probably forgotten you locked it
you have told me you do not remember things you do
Howard please if you went quietly now there won't be any trouble
i promise you
i will try the front door
hello operator
Operator
i must have locked that door just like you said and forgotten about it
Sorry i do not know why I'd do such a thing
Well we will forget about it now that you know you did it and that i was not lying
most people would have been angry and called the police
Howard I'd rather Mr Armstrong did not find you here when he gets back
but instead you were kind and patient
i wonder
Mrs Gordon could i stay here
Until i am well again
Please
that is not possible
for one thing i i haven't room
you have room for Mr Armstrong
yes but you could not expect me to ask him to leave could you
but you do not seem to understand
i haven't any other place to go and it is so nice here
i have never in my life met anyone as kind as you are
Howard please go now before Mr Armstrong gets back
oh here we are
if it weren't for him
i could stay here could not i
Well uh
Maybe i could talk to him
yes perhaps we could make some arrangements with him for later
you mean you'd talk to him about giving up his room
yes
You'd tell him how much i needed to be here could not you
yes i will talk to him but on one condition
i will do anything
that you go now
then i will let you know what he has to say later
Well that will be fine
but uh how will you get in touch with me
Well you will call me
i will give you my phone number
Just a minute i will get a pencil and write it down
but i might forget to call you
you know how it is with me
oh no you won't
now you just call me and i will let you know what arrangements have been made about the room
there
Thank you for everything

i have come to see about renting the room

what did you say
Mrs Gordon
you see Armstrong wrote me
he was sure it would be all right with her if i took his room for a couple of weeks while he is on his trip back east
oh
Well do you suppose i could speak to Mrs Gordon
you see Armstrong told me he was sure it would be all right with her
the room has been rented
you do not understand
if i could just talk to Mrs Gordon perhaps she might know of another place and i
Sorry but Mrs Gordon is not here now
Good bye

i could not find your coat
where did you put it
never mind
i am not going anywhere
what do you mean
you promised to leave if i spoke to Mr Armstrong
you can not break your promise
you can not
Why can not i
what is come over you
Why have you changed your mind just when you were being so reasonable
Just when i thought you were so different that i could trust you
i am very disappointed
what have i done
you have lied
that is what you have done
no i haven't
oh yes you have
you are just full of tricks are not you
so Mr Armstrong was coming right back was he
W Well he was i i thought he was
Well when i lie you can not count it as lying because sometimes i can not remember
but you took advantage of that
you thought i would not remember that Mr Armstrong had gone on a trip
Well i did not Until a man came to the door while you were upstairs wanting to rent his room
i do not know what you are talking about
so you were going to talk to Mr Armstrong
i i am sorry
i am sorry

ls our heart

and time is a one way street
ln parked in a garage
Called solitude
HeIlo

i am in this route for 6 years
Belm So Paulo So Paulo Belm
Jurema

Iracema
i have been on this road before it even existed
there was even danger from Indians
Scary
Spotted jaguars scratched the truck
you are reaIly stupid

or you won't even make it to
how old are you
Fifteen
or you won't even make it to sixteen

Your father's English

Let they come
got something good for me
Sure
Take your pick
but you remember how i want it
some rotten on top and solid wood inside
yes but
is it the girl
Talk she is okay
it is not that
but you know no solid wood
it is forbidden
you do not want to seIl
i pay the best price on the road
in cash
i can buy anywhere
no that is not it
i just can not give a receipt for solid wood
who wants a receipt
Load the truck
That'II take time
I'II wait
what about me
where do i go
she is tired
got a cooI place for her
Sure
we got some huts she can stay in
Go on I'II come Iater
my husband went to see Iife here and came back for us
are you here Iong
two months
and is this place any better
not at aIl
it is a Iiving heIl
Why
there is no work nothing
no they have this wood cutting here
and there is money in it
but the rest is a disgrace
i do not know if you understand this
you can only buy Iand that is deeded
and nobody here knows who owns the Iand
People here are aII scoundrels
the more they have the more they want
are you passing through
i came in a truck
the driver told me about this wood job
i do not know if I'II Ieave with him
if we hadn't that money coming you could take us along
i can not promise i do not know if I'II go or if I'II stay right here
so
i went into the bush to get this Iog a very heavy one
how many trips today
Only one
Only one
for this Iog
there is no road
ReaIly
we had to open the road and get go get a heavy Iog Iike this one
how far
Very far
yes some five kilometers
you made the road yourselves
yes me and my buddy
but it is done now
Thank God
this was the first one
there is more to get
the government's building roads now
yes but the government roads are not where we need them
we must enter this jungle get a Iog here and there
we must make so many of the roads ourselves
it is a hard knocked Iife but one must eat
but you make dough
no
in the end we do but not enough
now
the Iady i was staying with she said weIl she kind of said it
since we are hitting the road we might take them along
i would not take them
Why
Even if they had any money
i want no trouble with others
everyone get their chance
i am not a saint
when i have to defend myself i get my piece and puII the trigger
i believe that you'II find death if you Iook for it
you are okay if you do not Iook for it
so do you Iike our hoteI here
a Iittle
where is the sticker of our Lady we got at the procession
the one we got at the procession woman
I'II put it here
Give it to me

Brazil of Floriano Rondon e Getlio

Transamazonic road Valor and faith
Nobody can hold this country
the famous Tio
they caII me Tio Great Brazil
Tio Great Brazil
you have been aII over Brazil
yes
and i believe in it
Right
i talk about it aII the time
and i talk a Iot you know
so i got this nickname
but i kind of Iike it
ReaIly
is this place okay
Kind of
with time you'II raise a waII here and there
we had to get away from the road
Too much dust
and there is the road
we might even have to Ieave
the Iand belongs to the road
so we'II go farther away
Right
we are next
okay
Right on the baIl
where are you going
you are reaIly good
i want to hear it snap
I'II hit right
Play again
i hit
Let him play again
Play again
i did not touch it

Play
Go for it
here we are
here we are man
See we meet here
that is Iife
what are you doing in a place Iike this
ReaIly roughing it
Making money
Take your hat off
Making money
Making money
Sure
i measure it on the spot
before buying
but you do not mark it
Look over there
when the rich got here there was no road
they did not know this place
they came
Just a second
they came to this place after a Iot had been done
it is very hard here
a poor man buys a piece of Iand the rich come and take it away
they come and use the poor
that is it
they say it belongs to them and we must go
False deeds
False deeds
so they take over
Sure
Even INCRA i see it myself
i have been here eight months
when i arrived there was some Iittle men
the INCRA police came took away his Iand and gave it to a big shot
here
they took the man away and made him sign the deed
we can not even get wood
can not plant nothing
it is forbidden
Everything's forbidden here
the Iaw's the Iaw
it must be kept
and Iook here
there is the Iaw but not as you see it
must be kept
you say it is not kept
that some farmers buy the Iaw
but i think these people are very ignorant
they get no protection no documents
if i buy Iand here I'II want papers
do not you read it on the roads
do not buy before consulting INCRA
did not you see the biIlboards
yes
i see them they give good advice
i see and understand
you must buy Iand with documents
she comes
when the sun rises at dawn
then she leaves
when the sun sets on the horizon
it is like a ray of light on the forest
Carrying the light of a better Brazil
to faraway places
Full of wealth and longing for love
how is that Mr Z
Working Sundays
what can i do
what is that a soccer field
here
yeah
it is hard work
and underpaid
to get ahead to make things better
Gotta work to get ahead
Ain't that so
to make the most of it right
you know if there was no road this man would not have his Iand
Right
Sure
the road brings riches and progress for this man
or he'd be working for others
this is very good

another kid another gift
i am tired of rewarding straight married couples for not wearing a condom
i know right
how many kids do you need
it is like they are trying for a good one and that is not gonna happen
and the thought of them going at it just rutting like pigs
Thank you guys for meeting us at our favorite restaurant
you know on two separate occasions Ellen's water broke right over there
yeah we were here one of those nights
i remember because i was wearing sandals
so
someone looks like they have pudged out a little
is there something you'd like to tell us
Sure

and secondly
Let me tell them

Vince sent another waiter to cover our table

Getting separated was a really hard decision but once we made it
How'd it go with Vince we felt really good about it
i think we should leave
Really
'Cause the first basked of unlimited bread sticks just got here
i mean if we want they can just keep coming forever
Vince can not even talk to me
for some reason he thinks i am going to judge him
oh
okay
so we are doing that again
Doing what
you are gonna leave him because he is a mess
Looks like that is turning into a pattern with you
no no he broke up with me because he wanted to get his act together
oh come on
you left him when he needed you most
you know Ellen and i did the same thing
okay shush
i am talking
Maybe this is my fault
i feel stuck with him
what is it with me that i leave people when they need me most
you know we need you guys

we invited you guys here to talk about me and Rob

Hey what are you laughing at dough boy

Honk honk
you said you liked that
Well it is better than
Look
you are getting old
you are not very interesting
and you are both losing your hair
you belong together
if not for love then for the mere fact that no one else is gonna take you
i am not losing my hair
i starting plucking the grey ones and i could not stop
you proud of yourself
Go get it
Honey i just got a strike
and a fungal infection under my nail
is not that exciting
all i need is a factory job and a grey tooth and i will fit right in
Karen
you see that old man over there
he is Tommy
Man the Midwest takes a lot out of a teenager
i was looking for an Oprah moment not a Willard Scott moment
there is no way i am putting him on Jack Talk
Jack i can not believe that you won't help that man
Why should i
he mislead me
by using the name Tommy he implied he was young innocent muscular and curious
Honey if that man only had one day left and you could help him to live it honestly then that is what you should be doing
what is more important than living life as your most authentic self
you are up Anastasia
Stop following me around
you are not supposed to be in the kitchen
i just want you to know how sorry i am
it is fine
Just forget it okay
now go sit down
i still got ten more lobsters to pump full of cheese and paint little eyes on
Waiter can i talk to you
i will be right with you sir
Well we are back together
we figured it is best for the kids
yeah
we might as well make it all the way to the finish line
you know death
that is a cheerful way to put it
it is better than your way
Best for the kids
the kids hate you
the kids hate you
See this feels right
Sorry your entrees are late

i will not be quiet
you are a cop Vince
you are a cop
Cops
Let's go
Man

Move
would you look at that
he is a cop
by the way i would avoid the ricotta cheesecake
there was a cat sitting on the box
okay Tommy listen up
i have decided to help you come out
all right
i am not gonna lie
Initially i had some reservations
because it is such a huge responsibility helping another person through this journey
no it is because you are not what i call eye candy
you are more eye patch candy
are you being bitchy
i heard of that
they do it all the time on Designing Women
all right the first step in coming out is updating your references okay
the second step is telling your parents
i am so nervous Jack
no no no
Look
i know this is hard but it is so much better on the other side
i promise
Hey why do not we start with someone here
all right
you know for practice
Like um this guy over here
Excuse me sir
could you come over here
yeah great
this gentleman has something he'd like to tell you
Jack i do not think
no no no
do not think about it
Blurt it out
Trust me
it will make you feel better
Go

i am gay
oh my God
Dad you are gay

Wow

Mmm

Wow

yeah well actually things got better
yeah i mean you know i got a promotion and i am dating a great guy

it seems like things are really going well for you

Hey this is what you wanted right
for me to get more independent and get my act together
yeah yeah

i already did
Well it was really good seeing you
yeah
you too
you okay
what happened with Vince
he is not a waiter he is dating someone and he is happy
Sweetie i am sorry
it is hard to find out your ex is happy
he is got one foot bigger than the other so it is not all wine and roses
Did i make a mistake letting him go
i do not know if it is possible to ever really know
Come on
11 is a generous tip
i do not know what is grosser about you
Your cheapness or the tiramisu you spit on the back of my neck
you make me sick
you make me sick
Well
i did that
Pulaski's Bail Bonds is going to the semi finals
you suck me Barry Animal Hospital
Karen
i am such a good person
i helped that buxom old man
i can not wait to tell his story on Jack Talk i really do feel like Oprah
Thank you Jack
i feel alive for the first time
Good for you good for you www tvsubtitles netalthough the council may have its political differences
i know that we are united in our contrition
Conviction
that in order to tackle the issues laid out in the
Beverage sounds a bit pompous
can not i just say drink
you could if you weren't talking about the economist
William Beveridge and the report which inspired the welfare state
so what do you think
do i look the part
it looked better on Mummy
have you finished your chores
Found this under your bed
Silly me
i have been looking everywhere for that
you only ever wear pearls
it is a leaving present
for Matilda
she handed in her notice last week
you never said
Why would i
it is got nothing to do with you
she is been working for you for six years
and hands in her notice right after taking a fortnight's holiday
what was it doing under our bed
must have fallen out of my pocket
Why is not it in a box
will you stop asking questions
no no not south facing the goldfish will overheat
Well do not just stand there
have you forgotten the mayor will be gracing us with his presence in less than an hour
how can we forget when you remind us every five minute
i hope that humbug in your mouth is not one you have counted already
what do you take me for
what have we got here
Faworki
Polish pastry
we call it angel hair
Tentacles of Leviathan more like
you see that is what you get when you support exotic causes Father
Polish primary school indeed
Father do you know this mayor
no but his wife's quite charming
does a lot for charity
oh
Exceptionally clever woman
when he will start building school
we are only at the fundraising stage
but the men from his office measured the whole camp
so
how many
how many humbugs in the jar
SHE SlGHS
Morning Matilda
Mr Mayor
you are fired by the way
as of tomorrow
Why she could not just dress up as a princess like other girls her age
you know i can not award you first prize
i have to give it to an orphan or some other unfortunate
will you make enquiries
how was your holiday
yes good thank you yes
Margate
Lovely
are not you going to open it
a token of my appreciation for all your hard work
i do not think she likes it
i can not say i blame her
it is very cheap and tacky
Really
and again
Very beautiful dress Lady Felicia
oh would you mind
Very expensive
Thank you so much
Your estate borders the Polish camp doesn't it
Quite possibly
our estate's rather sprawling
Why do you ask
Father
Ah
Edwin is not it
that is a waste of money
there will be no school
so what time's the mayor arriving
will he be giving a speech
may i remind you today is a family day not a political rally
Father we should be at the gates by now
the mayor will be here any minute
oh and i thought you might like to present this to his lady wife
i made it myself
Quite exquisite
Even if the apostrophe's in the wrong place
what do you mean there will be no school
Ask the mayor
i do not know why you bother with make up
you can not improve on perfection
do not even think about coming to me for a reference
what
Lord knows you will never be pretty Kathleen but if you smile from time to time you might look less like the spawn of Satan
Your father's very stressed at the moment
he doesn't know what he is saying
he doesn't
COlN CLlNKS
Look at that
do you mind
Certainly Father
it is not a real rabbit
can you saw people in half
Only little girls
SHE SCREAMS
for goodness' sake
what on earth did you say to that poor girl
nothing
it was the magician
Father how much Pimm's have you had
Come along Father they will be here by now
Father Brown
now do not forget it is imperative we make a good impression
Eleanor good morning
Father Brown
Pleased to meet you
Mr Mayor on behalf of the parish of St Mary may i say how delighted we are that you have chosen this special occasion to deliver your inaugural mayoral speech
and of course we are extremely grateful for your help in our fundraising
Remind me what are the proceeds going towards
the primary school in a Polish resettlement camp
i am sure you are familiar with the community
not really no
no
no well why would you be
Kathleen darling come and meet the vicar
Priest
no matter
Still in one piece
i do not believe in God
i do apologise
she is a spirited little madam
Takes after her mother
an independent thinker with a questioning mind qualities i value highly
in a man perhaps
Rather unbecoming in a lady however
oh
Well follow me please
Matilda haven't seen you in Mass lately
are you feeling
Better yes
Thank you
Really go for it
BELL TlNGS
Roll up roll up
Goldfish win your goldfish
HE GROANS
Fetch some help
Please
oh
OK but it will cost you
you do know most women would kill to be in your shoes
you must be terribly proud
i hope he gets everything he deserves
an award winning strawberry scone
i do not mind if i do
if you permit the observation you do not seem quite yourself today Eleanor
i haven't been myself for quite some time
but trust me all that is about to change
Father Father
Magic man take funny turn
i leave him in ambulance tent but someone need to look
Magic man
oh a magician
Did you book a magician
oh whoever it is i will see to them
now be sure and tell the mayor everything is ready for his speech
Father Brown
Inspector
you might want to keep a close eye on your coffers
i am afraid we have had reports of a pickpocket on the loose
i have asked around
the boy dressed as a robot recently lost his mother to polio
will you stop gabbling
i cannot bear the sound of your voice
Looking forward to your father's big moment
my mother's more like
she is the one who should be mayor
it is not fair
Matilda was in the Wrens before she became a secretary
Why can not married women have careers
Kathleen if you ever need a friend
i do not
but if you did my door is always open
Ahem
Good morning
Sit up straight darling
Good morning ladies and gentlemen
Firstly may i say what a great pleasure it is to be here on such a pleasurable occasion
and on behalf of
Kathleen collectively may i thank Mr Brown and his team of church people without which today would have been implausible
my English is better than his no
with your hope we help to build a school for primary children in Poland a project which i feel personally extremely heartfelt about
Hypocrite
CROWD GASPS
Mr Mayor i have it on good authority that you are conspiring with our local MP to profit from the sale of a prime piece of property in Kembleford
i know this man
he courted my Polish friend
is not it true that you recently purchased a large area of agricultural land through a private company registered in your wife's maiden name
i do not know what he is talking about
and is not it a coincidence that the same area of land has been earmarked by central government to build a new coal fired power station information detailed in a confidential memo circulated within the Ministry of Fuel and Power which our local MP leaked to you
Ladies and gentlemen please do not listen to this imbecile
it goes without saying that such a development would exponentially increase the value of the land in question
Presumably you and Mr Carlisle plan to divide the spoils between you
where could they possibly build a power station in Kembleford
i am talking of course about the Polish resettlement camp
it is just sour grapes because i was elected instead of him
SPEAKS ANGRlLY IN POLlSH
it is hardly surprising
who wants a mayor who grew up on a pig farm
BOOlNG
Only pigs want pigs to represent them
i have heard enough
you sir
are you a pig sir
Oink oink
BOOlNG
Why do not you ask him why he withdrew from the elections eh
do not buy a pig in a poke
he is the one with the dirty secret
he is the one peddling porky pies
if you really want the truth i will give you the truth
HE CRlES OUT
LADY FELlCIA SCREAMS
Ego te absolvo ab omnibus censuris et peccatis
we saw everyone leaving
what is happened
is he dead
i am terribly sorry
is it true what he say
is government planning to throw us out from our homes
Susie please
a man is dead
a husband and a father
now is not the time
Mummy
i am thirsty
are you thirsty
Let's get something to drink
William
he looks so peaceful
Please accept my condolences
i will inform the relevant authorities
he is very young to have had a heart attack
he had a heart condition
that is why he did not serve in the war
do you think it was the shock of that man's accusations
Father
Mrs McCarthy
can i help you with
Bridget
my name is Bridget
i do not understand why she act crazy
she not the one making homeless
what happens to land when he dead
if wife do not sell maybe
no
i am afraid it doesn't quite work like that
if the government want to build on the land all they need do is issue a compulsory purchase order
Father i am worried about Mrs McCarthy
she is not herself
Probably just shock
Strong cup of tea plenty of sugar
it is not the first time she is seen a dead body
Usually she is planning the wake while he is still warm
how long's she been like this
since she see magic man in the ambulance tent
a stranger in town and not much of a magician by all accounts
Why are you really here
may i have a word
i have a few questions for this gentleman myself first
Summer fete
the great and the good in their Sunday best
then the mayor has a heart attack and everyone's distracted
Rich pickings is not that right
Father Brown
i am a bit busy at the moment
Go on
Get out of here
and a very good day to you Sergeant
Inspector
it is the public address system
i know exactly what it is Inspector
the mayor had a burn mark on his hand and then there was that strange crackling noise
what you think he was electrocuted
Suppose the system could be faulty
it is been tampered with
the back's been unscrewed
Fresh solder
this has been connected to the mains
Father
i think you better come quickly
i do not know what is come over her
Hardly the behaviour of a grieving widow
or a guilty conscience
Mrs Mayor i wonder if there is somewhere we could have a quiet word
i suddenly feel a little sick
you were married to the man for 12 years
do you not feel anything at all
Matilda is there someone who could look after Kathleen for a while
i do not want that slut anywhere near my daughter
Fine
she is not MY child
Mummy why does a policeman want to talk to you
i am sure it is nothing serious
if you could just come with me please
i want to stay with my mum
my bag
i will be back before you know it darling
Hay fever
Makes me terribly hungry
i just met the magician
we really should get some new chairs
These are riddled with woodworm
i thought your husband died in the trenches
when he did not come home he was presumed missing in action
Mrs McCarthy can i just
this is nothing to do with you
would you please just leave me alone
Mrs Mayor how would you describe your relationship with your husband
Susie has arranged for neighbours to look after Kathleen until you get home
Thank you
Mrs Mayor
would you like to hear my husband's favourite joke
I'd prefer it if you just answered
Please
a young boy and his father go out for a drive one day
there is an accident the car goes off a cliff
the boy's rushed to hospital where the surgeon almost collapses from shock says that is my son on the operating table
that is not funny
it doesn't even make sense
the surgeon is a woman
Your husband felt threatened by you
with good reason
Intellectually
i got him elected
we met at school
he was tongue tied awkward he struggled academically
i thought he was sweet so i coached him through his exams through university
i wrote all his speeches
i thought together we might make a difference
and then you found out he was having an affair
where did you find this
with his secretary
so you wanted to punish him
it opened my eyes
he did not care about me
he did not care about Kathleen
all that was ever going to matter to him was lining his own pockets and putting us back in our place
and while i was foolish enough to throw my life away
Kathleen still has a bright future ahead of her
Just as long as we were free of him
i see
Eleanor Knight i am arresting you on suspicion of murder
Murder
you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so
Whatever you do say will be put in writing and may be given in evidence
i was planning to leave him not to kill him
i am afraid i have taken a terrible liberty
i know you said you did not care but one must not let fear stand in the way of happiness
Bridget Maguire a chuisle mo chroi
i am going home now
it has been a dreadful day
all i want is a chance to explain
Let me call on you this afternoon
and then will you leave me alone
i will never bother you again if that is what you want
Three o'clock
Your ladyship
is that really necessary
it is for your own protection while i call for a car to take her back to the station
i did not do it
you have to believe me
Did you leak the details about the power station to Edwin Bloom
i thought if his corruption was exposed then we would have an excuse to leave with our heads held high
Why
do you think it was him
Just before he died the mayor said he had a secret
do you know what he was talking about
no
do you know where i might find Bloom now
we arranged to meet at three o'clock this afternoon
where
he was going to introduce me to a journalist
he wrote the address down on a card
it is in my bag
it is not mine
the murderer must have planted it
Nice try but i have heard it all before
what if they are after the whole family
Kathleen
i can take it from here Father
could Bloom have planted it in your bag when he gave you the card
i said i can take it from here
Hey hey
i just wanted to thank you for believing in me
oh
i realise it must have gone against all your instincts as a friend
my instincts
i know i hurt her terribly but i was young and foolish
did not know which side my bread was buttered on
you understand that i can tell
Fine filly like you bet you have known your fair share of married men
i write letter to House of Parliament
then they have to take notice yes
Dear sir Mr Winston Churchill
Edwin Bloom
you said your friend was courting him
yes
do you happen to know why he withdrew his candidacy for mayor
i think he get found out for criminal record
a criminal record
for what
how do you spell petition
P E T i T i O N
Criminal record for what
Yibby jibby GB something
do you know what it stand for
i was just passing
the Earl gives me so many they have been cluttering up the house for weeks
i thought someone ought to get some pleasure out of them
was there something in particular you came to see me about
i just wanted to check you were all right that is all
Quite all right thank you
and to say sorry
for interfering when i should not have
Please do not settle for anything less than you deserve
you have changed your tune
i just do not want to see you get hurt that is all
and since when have you given a flying fig about my feelings
we both know you think
i am a foolish old woman with ideas above my station
Well now hang on
and of course
i think you are a stuck up madam with too much time on your hands so we will leave it at that shall we
i will show myself out
Usual please Norma
you have heard the good news then
i am not going to pretend to like the man just because he is dead
do you play
from time to time
might i ask where you went between leaving the fete and meeting Eleanor this morning
Straight talking man Father
i do not appreciate playing games
what is this all about
the mayor was murdered
and you think i am responsible
what do you take me for
i am a founding member of the Peace Pledge Union
and yet you have a conviction for GBH
if you must know i punched a Nazi sympathiser after he insulted my lady friend
you might be interested to learn it subsequently emerged that the man in question was paid for provoking me and pressing charges by the mayor
must have made you very angry
of course it made me angry
Mr Bloom where did you go after leaving the fete
it is none of your business
it is my business if someone innocent hangs for a crime they did not commit
i went to the phone box to call a journalist friend of mine to arrange a meeting with Eleanor
he will be here shortly
you can ask him yourself if you do not believe me
or Kathleen
Kathleen
the mayor's daughter
i saw her hiding from the inspector outside the church
Thank goodness you are still here
i need to speak with Kathleen
i am afraid that could be difficult
Why
what is happened
Your neighbour's just reported her missing
what
she left a note saying she was going to see a friend and hasn't been seen since
a friend
what friend
she doesn't have any friends
i am sure there is a perfectly innocent explanation
Mrs Knight calm down
there is a killer on the loose my daughter is in danger
Why won't anyone believe me
i never meant to hurt you
but you did
if i could go back
and you can not
so if that is all you have to say Frank i think it is best that you
WALTZ MUSlC PLAYS
Absolutely not
we danced to this on our bunnymoon
18 carrots do not you know
oh Francis
Bless me Father for i have sinned
it is been three months since my last confession
i have done something terrible
it is never too late to seek forgiveness
Even if
Even if what
i killed my father
i have changed Bridget
Tell me it is not too late
oh Francis
so much for having changed
Aye and i can clearly see you are still a nag
but i am prepared to overlook that
Why are you here
Why now
Francis
what are you not telling me
Francis
Cirrhosis of the liver
i am dying Bridget
and she'd always make sure the house was neat and tidy when he got back from work
it was not enough nothing was ever enough
Hmm
how might i ask exactly did you kill your father
i prayed he would die
Hmm
Well wishing him dead is not exactly the same as actually killing him
Why were you hiding from the police this morning
SCRAPE OF METAL
you are the pickpocket
so I'd have enough money to get away
Doesn't look like i will need to anymore
will i go to prison
i do not think we need to involve the police at this point
i will see the contents are returned to their rightful owners
where did you get that
Matilda's hair curler
i pinched it from her bag when she went to call an ambulance
i do not know if it is worth much
may i see it
Probably hoping to impress my dad
i think she was actually in love with him
Earlier you said that Matilda had served in the Wrens
do you know what she did in the Navy
something to do with submarines and building engine wires maybe
she was an electrician
you can ask her yourself if you are quick
i saw her packing her car on my way here
Said she was going on holiday
Again
Father
Father Brown
Blast it
Yours i believe
Used to solder the mains supply to the microphone jack before you electrocuted the mayor
i do not know what you are talking about
Did he break it off
after Eleanor found out about your affair
is that why you planted the screwdriver in her bag
if you do not mind i have got a train to catch
she will be hung
and Kathleen will be an orphan
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
so how long
a year if i am lucky
i always told you you'd drink yourself to death
you told me a lot of things
and it serves you right running off with that floozy
i am not proud of myself
but i was not the same man that came back from the Front
the things I'd seen
Well i did not want to talk about them but you you asked too many questions
Cared a bit too much
so i found comfort in the arms of someone who did not care much at all
and where is she now
Fled to the hills as soon as the going got tough
did not want to play nurse
and you think i do
you are a good woman
Try hard not to show it but i know you still love me
Maybe this is our time
Maybe it is supposed to be like this
you and me
we need each other
we are both lonely
i mean what kind of life is this for you
Parish secretary
Ha
oh come on you must be bored out of your mind
and who have you got for company
an infantile priest and a hoity toity ice queen
if you are talking about Lady Felicia i will have you know she is compassionate and cultured and witty and intelligent
and a far better companion than you could ever hope to be
and
now i think I'd like you to leave
you do not mean that
Goodbye Frank
i knew what we were doing was wrong but i am not like Eleanor
when i walk into a room i do not turn heads
i know i was weak but
he made you feel special
for a while
Until i fell pregnant
i realised then he was never going to leave her
that it was all a lie
and the baby
he told me to get rid of it
Gave me the address of a backstreet butcher
Saint Matilda
my mother gave me this on my confirmation
i remember reaching for it just before i lost consciousness
when i could not find it i knew something dreadful was going to happen
Saint Matilda's the patron saint of large families
now i am never going to have children
i have nothing left to lose
i am so sorry
no one would have found out if your secretary hadn't walked in before i could put the screws back
and Eleanor
when i saw her bag unattended by the stall the way she just carried on as if nothing had happened when my whole world was falling apart
but now i am going straight to Hell i will be stuck with him for ever
God forgives all those who repent
Mr Knight never had a chance
but you do
no it is too late
for William perhaps
but not for Eleanor
you can save her from the scaffold
you can give her and Kathleen their lives back if you tell the police the truth
will you tell the truth Matilda
Mummy
i could have done that
you too old
Give me the boxes when finish unpacking
we go live in them
Ah
you are both here
Marvellous
i leave you to it
not in a mood for party
i have just come back from the town hall
so
in order for the power station to go ahead the government need access to the river and railway
Unfortunately for them there is another stretch of land between the Polish camp and the station which they do not own
so who does the land belong to
me
and having spoken to my husband who has Polish family
i can confirm we won't be selling at any price
and what is more given his high profile connections in Westminster no one would dare put any pressure on him to do otherwise
oh
Mind my dress
we go drink at camp
Well perhaps a small glass
will Mrs McCarthy join us
Ah
i am not sure Mrs McCarthy has much cause to celebrate
oh Father
Whatever it is can it wait until tomorrow
not without eating
if you are talking about my strawberry scones
i think you have had your fair share already today
i was thinking more about plankton
or worms
i thought perhaps he could do with some company
and if i remember correctly your kitchen faces north
so it doesCrowd Cheering
Cheering Continues
a good blow Sir Arthur
Someday i will learn never to wager against you
may i speak with Your Worship
i found him Your Worship
i found him
where
near St James's Gate
he lives with Amos Kidder a gunsmith
Amos Kidder eh
yes Your Worship
Wait for me outside
yes Your Worship
Man Humming
Humming Continues
Grandfather
Aye Ben
Why do they say i have no name
who says it
the boys at the school
i fought one for it yesterday
i will fight them all if i must
Aye Ben you will have to fight fight all your life belike
but why do they say it
you are young yet Ben
where is my father and mother
Dead both of'em
they died in India
is that why they say i have no name
because my mother and father are dead
Ben when you are older you shall know the whole story
now look here Ben
any fool can make a firearm but only a craftsman one that the user can trust
you will learn the gunsmith's trade and someday the shop will be yours for i will not live forever
Chuckles
Think of it Ben
the gentry comin' in and orderin' pistols and no better in the land
i will make pistols none better
but i will shoot them myself
Good morning Master Kidder
Good morning Your Worship
do you remember me
Aye Your Worship
Why haven't i been informed that my brother left a son
no no no
this is my son my own
do not take me for a fool
Look at him
the Blake eyes the Blake chin
and the Blake temper too
Come man the truth
it will do you no good to lie to me
Aye he is Sir Godfrey's son and my daughter Bessie's
that is better
now then what do you call him
Ben Your Worship
Ben eh
Well Ben how would you like to live with me at Breetholm
a gunsmith's forge is no place for a Blake
Plague take me you have the blood even if you were born on the wrong side of the blanket
you will be brought up as a gentleman
no handle to your name perhaps but horses and a servant of your own and all the rest that goes with it
Begging Your Worship's pardon I'd like to keep him here with me
would you deprive the lad of his birthright
no Your Worship
i know his father was a gentleman
and his mother was a lady by her gifts if not by birth
but he is mine
i brought him up since he was a tiny baby
can you read
no Your Worship
' Tis a writ naming me the boy's guardian and charging me with the responsibility of his welfare
Get the boy's clothes
Well my dear here he is
Your new mistress Ben
Mistress Arthur
Naturally
i expect to give the boy something to occupy his time
Arthur
the stables i think
Arthur
the lad has pride just like his father
oh the pattern fits
you will be surprised how well it fits
Godfrey would take nothing that did not belong to him
if the lad is the same he will be only too eager to work for his keep
Well speak up boy
i will take nothing that is not mine
Well spoken
a true Blake you see in speech manners and pride
that will be all Purdy
oh Paddy
yes Your Worship
this lad is young and green
i put him in your charge
See if you can make a stable boy out of him
yes Your Worship
Arthur
there is no question about it
the boy is Godfrey's son
Woman
i think i know why you want him here
do you my dear
because he is the rightful heir to Breetholm
Nonsense
and you are afraid that someday somehow he will prove his right
you know as well as i do there is no record of Godfrey's marriage
None except Godfrey's own record while he lived
he could do nothing dishonorable
Arthur
my noble brother he always made fools of his women
and now my dear shall i tell you why i want that brat of his here
as a gift to you
his presence here will remind you of his mother the woman Godfrey preferred to you
Horse Blusters
we cleans the harness
then we eat
here
Take it to bench yonder and mind you do not drag it in dirt
Horse Whinnies
Harnesses Clattering
i told you not to dirty it
now we have twice the work
Fight me will you
there
Paddy
Give over
How'bout that
Give over
you wanna kill him
Master put him in my care
i am master in this stable and there will be no beatings hear
he is calling for his chestnut mare and Miss Isabel's pony
Go and saddle'em
Ben
Ben lad are you bad hurt
i will kill him
oh no no no
no talk of killing Ben
i worked for your father and i loved him
we all did
he let a man be a man whatever his position
from now on you are bound to Sir Arthur his servant for life
he can do with you what he will and he will always have the law on his side
you will have to make the best of it lad
and if you are wise you will submit like the rest of us
no
Aye
you will learn as you grow
Chuckles
Come to my cottage when you have finished your work and my wife will give you a good supper
Hoofbeats
Doorbell Rings
i ran away
you are limping lad
are you hurt
a stone in my shoe
Why did you run away
he he made me a stable boy and i have been beaten
God forgive us
Why does he hate me so Grandfather
because you are bred true
because you have the blood of the family
because he knows that it is only the lack of a parson's blessing that makes him cock of Breetholm walk
he shakes in his ugly boots every time he looks at you
i am not going back
no
no you can not go back
we must leave before he finds you are gone
we will sleep on the road tonight
and tomorrow it will be new names a new life
and the money i saved will be good for a start
Get some bread and cheese from the kitchen
how will we live when our money's gone
i will find work
there will be other gunsmiths
Work for a wage in another man's shop
i have done it before
i can do it again
what could he do if he caught us
You'd go back to Breetholm
and you Grandfather
Men have been branded and jailed for less
You'd risk that for me
you are the beat of my heart Ben
Come
it is late and we have a long road ahead of us
no
we are not leaving
i am going back to Breetholm
Ben what are you sayin'
he said i was a Blake in all but name
i will show him
i will take whatever he has to give me and i will mark it down
and someday when i am master of Breetholm i will give it back
he can do with me as he pleases but i will never submit
Say good bye to me Ben
my tongue's stuck
Whinnies
Indistinct
Well we are almost ready milord
the vixens have whelped a splendid lot of cubs this year
Indeed
' Pon my soul i do not believe i have yet presented my daughter
here she is
Chuckling
or should not we be interrupting
Chuckles
this is my daughter Isabel
Lord Tarrant
Lord Tarrant rides with us today
Your servant Mistress Isabel
Your servant milord
Mr Hobart of Foxcroft Hall
how do you do milord
how do you do
i will give you my black mare
she is light but well up to your weight
where is that rascal Ben
the mare should be here by now
i will go Father
Excuse me gentlemen
Hammer Tapping
Why is not the mare at the house
she is an arbitrary female
she lost a shoe and kept it a secret
you will never learn will you Ben
what
how to be civil to your superiors
i am always civil to my superiors
now you grow rude and impertinent
you women are all alike accusing someone else of your own failings
Mistress Isabel your father is waiting for the mare
she is ready
i will bring her out
Master Hobart tell my father i am not well enough to ride today
oh i say
i mean what Just say it is a headache
i shall be quite recovered at tea
huh
Well it is good to know when you are going to get over them is not it
you did not say you were sorry i was ill
if you are then i am
you presume to think i feigned a headache to stay here and talk to you
i did not say that either
what think you of Master Hobart
i like his clothes
would you like to know a secret
he is asked for my hand
Well it is only to be expected
i have noticed him handling it at every opportunity
it should make your father very pleased
Whatever put that in your head
that which puts things in most people's heads observation
then you have been observing me with him
yes
were you not jealous
Jealous
one has to be in love to be jealous
you haven't answered my question
Nor do i intend to
Please Mistress Isabel
Answer me
are you jealous
you lout
you impertinent unruly clod
of course i am jealous you little fool
i am jealous of anyone who touches you or even looks at you
i am jealous of that idiot Hobart of your Father of even even the house servants
i am jealous of anyone who can be near you
now have i answered you
where have you been
the mare had a shoe loose Your Worship
she would have thrown it at the first fence
huh
Well assist his Lordship to mount
yes Your Worship
Clears Throat
Grunts
you clumsy fool
my apologies milord
Classical
a beautiful evening Mistress Isabel
Ben
Sir Benjamin
what are you doing here
Dancing
but my father
you must be mad
it is quite possible
Follow me
Continues
you should not have done this Ben
i had to
you looked so lovely i could not keep away
you are a fool darling
Darling
Only a slip of the tongue
what makes you so confident i won't call my father
because you love me
do i
for all you know i may be just amusing myself
Just
Ben
Even in jest you must not say things like that Isabel
Tell me that you love me
Say it
Say it
i love you Ben
i do love you
that is what i had to hear before i go
that is what i had to take with me
before you go
yes i am leaving tonight
but you can not
i do not want you to go now
is not this enough
is not it
no
i want my birthright
i want Breetholm
do not you see darling
it is it is being here and yet not having what is mine being near you and not being able to be with you always
i want all the world to know that i love you
Just wait for me Isabel
Wait
i i do not understand
you will one day when you are my wife
Promise me that too
Ben
yes
when you find the way to become master of Breetholm
i will find it
you will find the way to make me your wife
Go into the house
Come with me
Light the lantern
i intend to teach you a lesson Ben
you are hot blooded and you will find trouble as long as you live
i mean to teach you how to handle yourself the manly art of self defense so in the future you will always be able to give as well as take
have you ever fought with your fists Ben
yes
i do not mean vulgar scuffling in the stables
i mean according to the rules of the prize ring
no sir
Take off your coat and your education will begin
Your first lesson never be taken unawares
Call yourself a Blake will you
Pose as a gentleman will you
Purdy
Open the door
Open the door
Open the door

Stop
for mercy's sake stop
Why are you doing this for me
Ben i have no right to tell you this
after all he is my husband
but i am sure as sure as we hope for salvation that he is robbed you that Breetholm is rightfully yours
i have no proof Ben except what is in my heart and what i remember of your father
but proof there must be and someday you will find it
and when you do i want you to know that i will help you
Why
because had my prayers been answered you would have been my son
here is the clothes you wrote for
and a fine bargain i made
have you news of a ship
there is one out of Bristol tomorrow
for Portagee Brazil and Spice Islands
a merchantman
Aye
a brig of nigh 200 ton
her name the Tropic Star
but you will be weak to try it Ben
how weak do you think i am
he walks feeble but he do not stand feeble
Look
i let him think i was not as well as i am
Remember what your grandpa said
you was only to run for last ship when flesh and blood can stand no more
you speak for my grandfather Pale Tom
Aye
will you listen for him too
Aye
Flesh and blood can stand no more
Door Opens
what is it Ben
my business is with him
what business Ben
i must know
is it killing
not unless he tries it first
oh Ben i beg of you
if you so much as touch him he can have you hanged
i know that
is it worth throwing your whole life away
Till this matter is settled my life means very little
he keeps a pistol in the table drawer by his bed
is this what you are looking for
if you put that away i will fight you fair
you really think I'd soil my hands on a stable boy
you were ready enough to soil them when i could not hit back
i have been very patient with you Ben but i am afraid it is hopeless
i have done everything in my power to help you find yourself
Apparently i have failed
you have broken in here and threatened me your master with assault
it is jail for you my lad
a few years in Bristol Newgate should teach you your place

Gentleman
we are looking for a rogue
Well look somewhere else
you are frightening my gentleman
Laughing
all right doxie
this is all i have
i do not want it
Take it
i have work for you
what can i do sir
can you learn the exact whereabouts of the brig Tropic Star and the true hour she will sail
there are sailors who will tell me more than that
do you know the gunsmithery near St James's Gate
Aye
there is an old man works there by name Amos Kidder
he wears silver rimmed spectacles and he is likely to have stubble on his chin and kind eyes
you best watch out for the king's men who will be about
Tell the old man that i love him that i will see him when i come back from the Indies
Aye
i will go now
i will lock the door
Stay quiet till i come back
Bell Tolling
Shh
it is nearly time and you have a clear road to the dock
Did you see my grandfather
they have taken him to jail
then i stay in England
no
no you must not
he said so
you saw him in the jail
they know me there
he said i i have it by memory
Tell Ben he can serve me best by going to the Indies
and coming back with his fortune
Gold will unlock every door
he can not get me out if he stays and they will hang him sure for what he did
that is what he said
where is the Tropic Star
off the old sugar docks barely a stone's throw from here
and the tide's within the hour
what is your real name Your Honor
do not call me that
my name is Ben
nothing more
what is yours
Isabel
Why do you look so
nothing
i know it is too fine a name for a girl like me but my mother gave it to me meaning no harm
no name could be too fine for you
oh do you mean that sir
you think it means nothing to me that you likely saved my life
and no reason
oh yes
i had a reason
what
you won't laugh at me
i could never laugh at you Isabel
because you are a gentleman the first that ever came to my door
Maggie Martin now at the corner she knew a clerk of the king's court once and she is talked of it ever since
she is got a silver ring and a carpet and a drinking mug with roses painted on it fit for a queen
but she never knew a gentleman
oh it is time you were going now sir
Please sir could i walk with you to the corner maybe
I'd like Maggie Martin to see us together
then she'd know you'd been here
who were he
the Duke of Roehampton
Stowaway sir
Just found him in the hold
can you use an extra hand Mr Grimes
Aye
that i can sir
have you ever been to sea
no
you will learn
Your first lesson is that you will always call me sir
Set your gallants and royals Mr Grimes
Aye aye sir
Gallants and royals
Look alive
you Caleb Green lay aft and sit up on the weather vane
Aye aye sir
what is your course
Nor norwest
Mm hmm
you are a full point off your course
Keep awake
Why did you deflect the compass last night
what are you talking about
you know what i mean
you changed it and i took one from the mate for it
i wanna know why you did it
Aye
you have a right to know
you see this
i noticed it before
D D for debtor
Fifteen years in the swamps of Guyana
Fifteen years in the hot irons because i owed 10
my crime was having no money
mine was having no name
i wanna know why you changed the course
if you look at the charts you will see there are islands to the southwest of here
yes
there is a fortune to be made in those islands
i heard the tale from Spanish sailors that touched there long ago
Oyster pearls bright as the moon and big as your fist
a fortune for the man that dares try for it
Why do you think i shipped in this stinking tub
i have been waiting three years
Begged and starved in the gutters of Bristol for a berth like this one a ship that would sail these waters
if there is a fortune to be picked up so readily why haven't the Spanishers come back
they made a bloody record when they were there
the islanders were peaceful enough at first but they finally arose to drive them out
there was a massacre and only a few of the Spanishers escaped
have the islanders forgotten
Aye
i doubt it
you mean to chance it alone
Aye i will chance it to wipe this clean forever
you are going to desert when we get to the island huh
Aye
and if you breathe a word of this to a soul i will kill you
you aloft
Stow your gab and get on with your work
you heard me
Aye i heard
and do not concern yourself
i will say nothing for a very good reason
i am going with you
Land ho
where away
two points off the starboard bow
Captain
Land
here
there ain't any on the chart unless we are 50 knots west of our course
Grimes
there is strong currents hereabouts
Captain
or perhaps it is a magnetic variation
Stove in me ribs
i have got more dirt than that under me toenails
Nay there is a big island beyond
'Tis a cloud
no look
' Tis inhabited
i can see the marks of cooking fires
we will not take water there Mr Grimes
Belike they are peaceful sir
Nay i have been warned of the islanders hereabouts
Bloodthirsty cannibals every one
but we will seek an anchorage and lie to for the night
Up a point Mr Grimes and put a man in the chains
Aye aye sir
Up a point
Look
she is leaving
Aye
we have burned our bridges

Good morning Your Worship
Good morning
Well who is waiting
Milord Havistock sir
he insists on seeing you at once
he thinks he should be made a knight commander of the Bath
i do not
i told the king so
Laughs
who else
Colonel de Forest sir
he wants you to use your influence to
Ah London is full of colonels who want brigades and bishops who want to be archbishops
who else
a goodly number of the usual sir
and oh a sailor sir
a common seafaring man who claims he has a tale to interest you
Tell him to take his tale somewhere else
i have no time to waste
but begging your pardon sir
i told him to go
he laughed at me
he said to give you this sir
huh
Hmm
Well
Whistles
Well'tis an interesting calling card
the others can wait
Tell the sailor to bring in his tale
yes Your Worship
Chattering
Please please please
one at a time
Please milords and gentlemen
but i have been waiting for hours
this way my man
Angry Murmuring
i will give you five minutes
my time is not to be wasted
so i heard
that is why i came to you
Compliments are a waste of time
i was told that you are a man of influence
in parliament and in the courts
i won't deny it
that you can buy titles or pardons make men or break their enemies
Come to it
do you know Sir Arthur Blake of Breetholm in Wiltshire
Aye
he gambles on the exchange
Well he is my uncle and my enemy
Boil me but you have chosen yourself a hard one
he is also a usurper since his title and estates are rightfully mine by inheritance from my father Sir Godfrey Blake
Godfrey
Aha
yeah i knew Godfrey
a buck
what do you want of me
Breetholm my right to it confirmed in law
that is simple
Why come to me
because it is not so simple
there is never been any proof that my father was ever married
and you believe you have any rights
and that is not all
i am wanted by the crown for an attempted assault against Sir Arthur while i was still his bonded servant
a hanging offense
i knew that when i came here
Fry me if you are not a buck too
Sit down
now you want to be confirmed in a title and estates to which you may have no legal right and to be pardoned by the king for a hanging offense
Aye
Aye
Well'tis a modest request
if you feel it is beyond your powers i can go to someone else
no keep your chair
it might be arranged
but uh it would cost
i think more than you can afford
is there enough there
Chuckles
Stammering
which reminds me that my fee will be 2 000
i will pay you 5 000 if you ask it
Boil me sir will you haggle with me
when i make a price i hold to it
Chuckles
now i want some details
Your father was Godfrey Blake huh
and who was your mother
Bessie Kidder
yeah
where were you born
in the city of Bombay in India
my father took my mother there
without a parson
that is what they say
Ah it is a hard nut Ben
Perhaps too hard even for my jaws to crack
Your enemy has the law on his side which would not matter a threepenny bit if he did not have power to go with it
do you understand me
i will have to deal with men of his own kind arrogant lordlings and stuffed gowns who will be much more likely to favor his case than yours
yeah they will be against you because they know that'tis only a sham that keeps the likes of them up and the likes of you down
the sham of blood
and the truth is a man's a man whatever you name him
Well come back in a month
no
no i will take care of these
yeah they will be safer with me
you do not trust me
Well it seems i have no choice since i put myself in your hands
Fry me
you have got a head on your shoulders
i will have to have some money though to pay a few debts
how much
a thousand pounds
yeah
Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut
Your time's up
Get out
Get back with ya
you will find him in here sir
i have a pistol you made for me many years ago
Aye
Once i did the best work in the shire
Perhaps you could repair it for me
i have got no tools and there is no workbench here
what if you were free
Free
huh
that would take 40 40 for my offense
God knows it was no crime
there is none who will pay it for you
one
one only
but he is far away
Perhaps dead
can you stand a shock a surprise
Aye
you won't cry out but sit there just the same as though we were still talking about the pistol
Aye
is he alive
Alive and well
where is he
Back in England
is he caught
no
and he won't be
he is right here beside you
Ben
Hush
Listen to me
i haven't come back a poor man
Put your hand beside you under your coat
no
you are still hiding from them
i hope to have my freedom in a month
then for a month it is enough to know that you are alive and that you have got your gold
if i bought myself out now they'd know where i got it
Take it anyway just in case
Aye in case
but i will not use it till you are a free man
if you can stand it here
i have stood it these years
i will make these years up to you every minute of them
Footsteps
the turnkey's coming
if you should want me get in touch with Silas Jones at the George Crown
Aye that was a good pistol you made me
i am sorry you cannot mend it
Good day to you

Ben
Shh
i do not want to disturb your father at least not yet
i can not believe my eyes
where
how
i had to see you if only for a moment
I'd begun to think you dead
Later you shall know all
Ben they are beautiful
Priceless
i have come back with a fortune darling
i have come back to claim what is mine
you haven't forgotten your promise
no dear not for a moment
Footsteps
that may be Father
if he found you here he'd kill you
he is tried that before
when will i see you
i will come tomorrow same time
where are you living
Suppose something happened and i needed you
i am at the George Crown in Bristol under the name of Master Silas Jones

we will give you a minute
Did you see Pratt
Aye
after trying for two days i reached him at his own house
Ben he said he knew of no Benjamin Blake
he denied flat ever having heard of ya
yeah i should have known better
i was a fool ever to put my trust in him
have you anything to say in your own behalf before the court pronounces sentence
no Your Lordship
i have nothing to say in my own defense
for i am guilty of the crime charged against me
and if i could live my life again I'd be guilty of the same crime and be prepared to hang for it again
the charge is that i a bonded servant attempted assault against my master
it matters nothing that that assault was richly deserved
the law says that i must hang for it
Beyond that the law does not look
if justice were not so blind it'd be quite clear that men like Sir Arthur Blake should not be permitted to make chattels out of other human beings to use them as playthings for their cruelty and brutality
i alone dared to defy him because we are both of the same blood because i suffered a personal injustice at his hands an injustice which is of no interest to Your Lordship or thejury
Others have suffered as much as i more than i
Men have been crippled by him
one was blinded
Others broken in spirit and soul without any hope of redress within the law because the law is on the side of Sir Arthur and his kind
Your Lordship this is treasonable
the prisoner will be allowed to finish
Thank you milord
i hold no grudge against this court
i have had a fair trial
Your Lordship and the jury have only done your duty toward me
but i only hope in going to the scaffold that i can hasten the doom of this injustice
that the day will come when Englishmen who serve other Englishmen will do so as free men paid for their work but keeping title to their spirits and their souls
Murmuring
what the prisoner has said is interesting and largely true
but as you point out the justice of this court is rigidly confined by the law
and so i must pronounce sentence upon you for the crime of which you have been found guilty
the sentence of this court is Pratt
Milord
may i beg the indulgence of this court
Crowd Murmuring
no Audible Dialogue
uh
the court will listen with interest to anything that Mr Bartholomew Pratt has to say
but Your Lordship the jury has already made its findings
i submit that it would be outrageous to
the court will hear Mr Pratt
Clears Throat
but what the learned gentleman says is true
the court has already found the prisoner guilty
on the basis of the evidence submitted no other finding could have been made
the prisoner is guilty of the crime charged to him but only if it can be proved that any crime was committed in the first place
Judge
i do not understand you Mr Pratt
the evidence has not been refuted
the prisoner has entered no denial
Perfectly true milord
as i understand it he is charged with an attempted assault upon the person of Sir Arthur Blake baronet of Breetholm
Mm hmm
yeah
then milord i must submit that there has been no crime since there is no Sir Arthur Blake and since the man accused of committing it is and was at the time of the alleged offense himself Sir Benjamin Blake
baronet of Breetholm
Crowd Chattering
Gavel Rapping
Milord Your Lordship knows that thejury
but milord these these proceedings are highly irreg
Milord i protest
most extraordinary statement Mr Pratt from one of your standing and repute
i am prepared to prove it milord
if Your Lordship will read this entry from the log of the East India Company ship Calcutta Queen which i obtained from the company's offices in London
this day i joined in holy wedlock
Sir Godfrey Blake passenger and Mistress Bessie Kidder a passenger
i have also here the sworn statements of the mate of the Calcutta Queen who is still living and of Dr Fleetwood formerly of Bombay and uh others
Crowd Murmuring
Clears Throat
Isabel
Isabel
Well he is won
Won
Aye
he had the proofs in court and gained his release
Bartholomew Pratt's behind him
no barrister in England would take a case against Pratt
then Breetholm is his
Aye
Well do not you understand
we are ruined
you are
i am not
what do you mean
i did not tell you why he came here that night
it was to ask me to remain here as his wife
not really
now that has possibilities
yes
as a fond father i might even be persuaded to give my blessing to such a brilliant marriage
i am afraid your blessing won't be appreciated
i intend to make it appreciated
what do you mean
you are my daughter
we understand each other
Well
i know your marriage will be a happy one
i only hope that in your happiness you will not be tempted to forget your poor father now that he is broken and humbled
Why should i forget you
oh i am certain you won't
i am counting on the milk ofhuman kindness which i am sure you will not allow to uh curdle within you for your filial affection
Come to the point
if you insist
in case you are tempted i ask you only to remember that we share one secret which might be of interest to the happy bridegroom
Go on
a strange fellow Ben moody and quick to take offense
what would he say for instance if he were to learn who told me that I'd find him at the George Crown the night he was arrested
what would he say to that my dear
you would not dare
would not i
and even if you did he would not believe you
Why do you think he came back
for revenge
no
for me
he loves me
all his life he is worshipped me
he will do anything i ask him believe anything i tell him even if you were to swear to him on a Bible
Ben you you must not believe what he says
it is not true Ben
it it is not true
Sometime ago you were concerned with my education
Perhaps now we can complete it
it will give me the greatest satisfaction
and it is my wish that the estate known as Breetholm
shall be divided among my friends its present tenants
to be held by them in fee simple
as freeholders and free men while they live
and by their heirs and assignees thereafter
the manor house and park
i give to my grandfather and dear friend Amos Kidder
in witness whereof i have this day set my hand and seal
it is signed Ben
once known as Sir Benjamin Blake baronet and master of Breetholm

EveDr Weinberger the data i am getting on SE 2020 via the DSS shows that it is moving out of the scheduled orbit
Punch up SE 2020 with coordinates
Check the orbit deviation and alert Canberra
i will be right there
we have lost the satellite over Queensland
they self destruct if they stray from orbit
Canberra lost it when we did
Order a copy of all transmissions to DSN stations in the last 24 hours
it landed and then Australia lost transmission
Looks like the U S government has a problem in Australia
oh crikey
Terri get the catching bag
These lizards are like land crocodiles
their teeth are like tiger sharks
and if you get too close they will towel whack you
you are a slippery little guy
what a steamer
Close
not only can they run like blazes but they can also scale these sharp rocks Iike it is going out of fashion
this is his territory
Up there he will have a couple good looking Sheilas just waiting for him
he gave me the slip
that is all right
have a look at this
Poo
Perentie poo
what a beauty
that is some good perentie poo
it can tell me a lot about the animal
what we have got in here is pig's ear snake skin a little bit of lizard skin
and check this out
a lizard claw
from another lizard
the perentie is the master
he sits up here in the escarpment watching from his nice cool tunnel
Watching
Waiting
Sees a bit of movement
they can spot movement from 300 meters away
Way down there in the sand dunes
Spots it
Goes down
Waits
Runs out
Strikes
Lacerates
then swallows it whole and comes back up here into its cool retreat
this is really important
i am going to save it for later
we are here in the outback on a field study trip for the zoo hoping to find some of Australia's more unlovable creatures for research
here is your poo mate
we are heading for snake country
Australia is home to the most venomous snakes in the world
and with a bit of luck we will find some
okay Sui in the truck
this is going to be a great adventure
you all right mate
you never know what is out there
Wheeler
Archer
must be good if they got us in here at 3 00 a m
Ron
Wheeler
Good to see you
at 2200 hours East Coast Time a U S satellite was terminated over Australia due to mechanical failure
the primary function of this device was intelligence collection
Gentlemen
Thanks for coming in at such short notice
the downed satellite collected sensitive photographic data
the equivalent of a million images are stored inside the hard drive of this
the black box
a beacon
an Alpha Proton Beacon
Developed for a Mars mission
Designed to withstand landing in the most extreme conditions conceivable
i did not know any were operational
as far as we are concerned none are
we have every reason to believe that the beacon survived
if it ends up in the wrong hands it has enough documentation to change the power structure of the entire modern world
have you picked up any signal
Australia has twice in the last four hours
that is encouraging
it is inconsistent
Either there is damage or someone's beaten us to the site
we will hope for damage
we are leaking word of a routine parts pick up
Standard satellite junk
we can not risk tipping anyone to the potential of this
Translation
you will only have basic local support
one operative
so it is really on the two of you
you leave first thing in the morning
North Queensland
Australia
Thank God it is a friendly country
Leave my cows alone
Think you are going to get away with it that easy
i do not think so
this is private property
you dirty rotten stinking mongrel
no
Poor Daisy
you no good cattle stealing handbag
now go on nick off
Get down
down
what do you want
Call off your dogs and i will let you know
I'd offer you a cold drink but i do not want you to stay
i know since Otis died that you have had a hard time on your own
you do not know anything about me
i know you have been shooting up a storm at the river
i have had calls
this could get you into a serious amount of trouble
how come it is illegal for me to kill a croc but not for a croc to kill my cows
the law is the law
you must work within the legal boundaries
you work within them
i will work with a shotgun
i am warning you
i will find a solution
do not do something you will regret
you are here so i guess i already have
now rack off Sam
Get your scrawny bottom back in that truck
Come on
Chop chop
you are trespassing on my land
i mean it Brozzie
so do i
it is croc killing time
it is croc saving time
we have had to interrupt our great adventure to help some local fishermen with a problem crocodile
Come on Sui
in this case the crocodile sees the fishermen as the source of its food supply
and this young tacker has been getting very cheeky
the last few months a crocodile has been causing trouble around here where people are swimming
when the blokes come back from fishing they filet their fish throw the scraps in the water and that encourages the croc to hang around
now everybody who comes down here is scared the croc's going to have a go at them
as the world population explodes our wildlife is under increasing pressure to survive as natural habitat diminishes every single day
our job is to locate the croc jump it try and get it into the boat then relocate it so that it will never run into conflict with people again
now it is not the croc's fault
he doesn't come into our swimming pool
we are actually going into his
they are apex predators at the top of the food chain
without crocodiles the whole ecosystem would suffer
we have got to catch this croc
otherwise they will shoot it dead and turn it into boots bags and belts
during the day a crocodile in this river can remain almost invisible
but when night falls our spotlights should lead us to him like a signpost
and i will face the added danger of having to catch this crocodile by hand
Steve's been catching crocodiles this way with his dad since he was a boy
the dangerous part is judging the size of the croc before jumping it
we are looking for eye shine
Crocodiles are ambush predators
they rely on camouflage
but in the spotlight their eyes shine bright red which enables us to sneak right up on them
got it mate
Keep your spottie right on it
Get around
here is a battle of strength and endurance
the only way to toss this croc is to wear him out
he is got the strength of three blokes my size
Get the jaw rope
our only means of restraining him is via a top jaw rope
Get her with a top jaw rope
it is critical to get his top jaw secured
Lassoing those gnashing thrashing teeth doesn't come easy
Get it on
he is thrashing too hard
if i loosen my grip he will rip me to shreds
Go
i got it
Hang onto her
i will tie her off
the second top jaw rope is not on really good
Protect Sui
Get the top jaw rope
Too easy mate
i called you in because you are an Aussie
i have an important assignment for you
the ClA is sending two undercover field operatives to Australia to retrieve the SE 2020's data recorder
is not satellite surveillance your department's domain
it is
but Reynolds got the jump on me
he bypassed the National Reconnaissance Office before i could respond
he is after the top job and this could just give him the edge over me
what do you want me to do
Get the beacon before Archer and Wheeler
Australia's main industries are mining and agriculture
Coal is the most important resource followed by copper lead and bauxite
that is a decent cover
Let's go with mineral exploration
we are taking the mobile antenna
yeah
this sure doesn't look like your average satellite recovery situation
the Aussie contact won't figure it out
Well this is all i need
Come on
there is nothing that is gonna hurt you in Australia
this is the fierce snake
Come here mate
the most venomous snake in the world
this is one wild unit
this is the snake you do not want to get tagged by because it possesses enough venom to kill 150 000 rats
but who cares
this bloke could have enough venom in one bite to kill a hundred blokes my size
Look at the coloration
Beautiful coloration
Settle down mate
you would not want to take a whack off a snake this size
you can see his venom glands behind his head
this right here is where you see the work of my dad
he taught me to be one on one with the snake
to be at one with it
to feel it in my fingers
to allow the snake to feel that it is in no danger
Settle down sweetheart
Settle down now
she is just trying to tag Steve o on the face
i know you are sweetheart
you are a beautiful snake
you are absolutely gorgeous
it is starting to flatten its throat out
it is starting to get aggressive
you are all right mate
Settle down
See it is coming back on me
Real fast
These snakes seem to know the toxicity of their own venom
it is swinging around agitated neck puffing up
that rapid tongue flicking
it is getting upset
Make no doubt about it it'd whack its fangs into me at any given moment
See how it keeps lining me up
it is really grumpy
Beautiful snake
you are just a little grumpy now
they are just like people
she just wants to move away from me
many people think snakes are evil monsters cruising around killing people
those fangs are like hypodermic needles
two hypodermic needles sitting in the back of their head ready to
Settle down sweetheart
how was that for a swing
Straight at me
Look at these flies
Right in me eyes
it is so dry and hot out here the flies are coming into my eyes for a drink
any form of moisture
she is starting to settle down now
Look at this
Nice and quiet
Look at her
what a beauty
i call it her because i am in love with her
she knows i mean her no harm
what a beautiful snake
you know i am a professional
if you see a snake like this do not muck with it
and one thing's for sure do not try this at home
Far too dangerous
this snake could have enough venom to kill me and a hundred other blokes out here in the West
what an honor to share territory to share space with such a beautiful animal
Steamer
i have got to tell you I'd rather deal with this snake than a lot of people i know
i reckon that people are much more dangerous
no questions
Gentlemen that concludes this briefing
Reynolds do you have a second
Sure
i was surprised with the selection of the Australian mission
Surprised or disappointed
both
the second member should have been from my department
Wheeler will do fine
Fine is not what my division aims for
Wheeler has excellent support
i have no doubts they will succeed
so you won't be offended if i keep a close eye on the situation
there is a line
we will both know if you have crossed over it
Brozzie
Brozzie
Sugar
Get away
Get away
Shoo
Brozzie
Get away
Shoo doggies
Go away dogs
Shoo
Go home
Brozzie
do not bother getting out
i won't
Good
Perfectly content to stay here thanks
what is it this time
i have got good news for you
you have been fired
no i have found some experts for us on crocs
Unless they work in a belt factory i am not interested
the lrwins are relocation specialists
Really
i could have them over for afternoon tea
Throw a nice big croc on the barbie
the main office is contacting them
Tell the main office i will be contacting a croc on my own thank you
Come on Brozzie they are experts
Go on nick off
Sugar
i see you have been feeding my dogs
what is the Aussie guy's name
Joe Buckley
Jo Buckley
Welcome to Queensland
Vaughan Archer
Bob Wheeler
Looks like an interesting place
we always say we have got something here for everyone
any immediate requests
no thanks
we are anxious to get on the road
Vehicle looks good
what is the story with this
Kangaroos
Roo bars or bull bars are often the cause of sudden death for wildlife here in the outback
Millions of animals die every year from collisions with vehicles
Kangaroos in particular are getting clobbered all over the bush
what a shame
and this is a tragedy that we see all too often out here on the outback roads in Australia
Part of our job is to pull the carcass back off the road so that any wildlife that comes to feed on it doesn't get clobbered by another vehicle
Steve she is got a joey
Come here
we might have a chance to save her baby
there is a girl
she feels cold
does she
i will nurse her
Whip your shirt off we will give her something warm to cuddle up in
a joey this size would never fend for herself
she will need us to help her survive
we have been adoptive parents for joey kangaroos for many many years
we successfully raised them and got them back out into the wilds where they belong
but they take a heck of a lot of nurturing and caring
you all right
Let's go girls
you are kicking
we are prepared for any wildlife emergency
we have to feed her just like a baby every couple of hours around the clock
here we go sweetheart
you ready
okay just like in mama's pouch
Upside down
this will teach you to go after my cows you no good rotten crocodile
a nice juicy chicken for you
how long will you need with all this stuff
Hooking up with the network will tell me if the problem is the beacon or just our equipment
it won't take long to set up the antenna
Need some help
i got it covered
what about you
he is the technical guy
i am the strategy
as long as we have got some down time why do not you and i
i will get some rest
here
you will need that
Right here on the ground
there is nothing out here to worry about
this is the bird eating spider
the largest arachnid in Australia
i am going to get a stick because she is poisonous
See that movement
These guys are ambush predators
they launch themselves onto their prey hang onto it with their front legs and drive their fangs right into it
See how her legs are up
Look
that is not the spider shaking
that is me shaking
These things make me nervous
and here is why
See her little legs sticking up
you are all right sweetheart
Crikey
what they do is wait for their food source to come to them
Crikey
Ant just bit me on the back
this is scary
i am so nervous
they wait down in their hole until the cool of night comes then they climb out of their hole and sit at the front of the hole just like this in the full ambush position
you all right sweetheart
there she is
Just like that
Ready
any animal that she can overpower and kill with her venom that is her target
Animals like mice frogs lizards geckos small birds grasshoppers anything comes past
she will wait in the ambush position fly out of the hole grab it and whack drive those huge great fangs right into its chest cavity
they have got very toxic venom super toxic venom and a lot of it
their fangs are larger than a snake's
Crikey they are powerful
sometimes they will actually kill their prey just with the force the ferocity of that hit when the fangs go in
that is how powerful they are
Let me just see if i can demonstrate her fangs
Get out of my eyes flies
not now
Come on buddy
Come on sweetheart
you are all right babe
Stop there babe
a strike
that was a strike
i upset her
this is nature's way
she is a grumpy girl
she is a beautiful Sheila actually
Show us your fangs
Right there
have a look at the size of these things
Look at that
Driving them into the stick
you can feel them grinding into the stick
has she got a set of fangs or what
have a go at that
Look
there they are bigger than most of the Australian snakes' fangs
she just injected a bit of venom there
Sorry sweetheart
that Whoa my breath scared her and she got nervous and had a strike
have a go at this
Look
Look at the venom on that stick
Real syrupy thick venom
and she'd have a lot of it
we should get this girl back to Australia Zoo so we can do research on the toxicity of the venom
and that will give us an indication of how we can best look after them and this entire environment
she is a beautiful girl all right
Really nice
but whatever you do do not ever try and wrangle a spider
I'd hate to get this amount of venom stuck into my veins
i reckon it would be one heck of a rough journey
could even kill me
Hey Terri
can you get a container
i got a big bird eater mate
Breeding season is a real bummer for the male bird eating spider because after they mate the female kills and eats him
Come on sweetheart
Throw the lid on mate
Careful Steve
they say i have got nerves of steel except when i am dealing with spiders
have a go at this
in this hole i reckon we are onto something
what we have got here is a beautiful hole
you can see tripwires out in front
here is one two three
and that is what stimulates the spider to whammo strike and hit
Good hole
it is not completely understood why or how they build these holes
Just kidding
if we have a look down in there here is a chamber
and here is what was in the chamber
Pretty well busted up
Couple of fang marks in the abdomen there
she is had a feed on this bloke
this was actually her husband
he probably mated with her over the last couple of days or nights
Whammo
i am finished with you
it seems pretty harsh but this is nature's way
we were heading further into the outback when a call from the Department of Fauna and Fisheries suddenly changed our plans
the local ranger Sam Flynn is having a problem with a rogue crocodile on a river just north of here and he needs our help
it seems a big croc has been giving a rancher a hard time and the situation is way out of hand
the wildlife service needs our help
it sounds like the rancher is tough
Real tough
and the croc sounds good
Real good
from what we have heard someone needs to be relocated
we could go in at night shine a light in the rancher's eyes jump her and throw her in the boat wrap a rope around her head and then take her to a new river system
but we are not that brave
we are going after the croc
Rack off
Nick off come on
i will get you you rotten
Show us your eyes
Come on
now i got you you mongrel
oh dear
everything okay
i lost it again
Thanks
Either it is damaged or it is in the river
Submersion in water would affect transmission
our inflatable has a decent outboard motor
and i have a depth finder and an underwater scanner
so if we end up fishing for it we are covered
you Aussies think of everything
what did you bring to protect us from alligators
Crocodiles in this country
Same thing
Hardly
you will know it if you meet a croc
it is back
Snake
have a go at this whopper
this is a King
King Brown
Babe get the catching bag
you can see why they call him King Brown
this is a snake rescue
we need to take him with us and set him up somewhere where he won't conflict with cars
Nuts
King Brown snake
Member of the black snake family
Comes out here onto the road trying to get some sunlight and heat up in the morning
See the way he flattens his neck out
that typical cobra neck flattening
what he is doing is saying i am venomous
i am wild and i will bite you
Did you see that
would not want a bite around here
their venom is highly necrotic
that means you rot and things drop off
I'd hate to get bitten there
Steady mate
you are all right
and this snake species actually has the highest venom yield of any snake in Australia
Pretty soon he will settle down
he will work out that i mean him no harm
it is good that me and Terri came along
otherwise the next car down the track would have slaughtered him
they are quick and they will eat other snakes
there is not another snake they'd encounter that they would not eat
in fact this big bloke here probably would have eaten other venomous snakes of his species
they can actually be cannibalistic
Out of my eyes
do not bite my boot
Right behind his head are two huge venom glands
and he'd be able to belt in like two hypodermic needles around about 300 milligrams of venom in one hit
Terri where is the catching bag
got it
Good one mate
Go
Twist
King Brown
that is one snake to release and one croc to catch
we got a couple of problems
the beacon's transmitting the intermittent signal so it is probably in the river
and my partner doesn't want to get his gun wet
it is on this property
the river should be right down there
so we run our cover gain access and execute
what about the dogs
we will take our chances
we are set
no one's around to get in the way
you look beat
Trouble with the satellite investigation
Personnel or hardware
Possibly both
do you need me to stay on in case anything comes in
yeah if you do not mind
of course not
i have got a State Department reception with Ansell
if i do not show it could send up a flare there is a problem
the last thing we need is for anyone to think there is a leak in the boat
we are looking for a big male croc
Probably around the 12 to 14 foot mark
According to the ranger he is dominated this section of the river for quite some time
all of the riverbank in this area is private property
but to a big old croc this is his territory
it is a real shame when people come along and want him out
Finding him could take days even weeks
and he is probably watching us right now
i will have to go ashore and look for slides
they are the marks on the banks that are left by crocodiles sunning themselves
okay Ter this looks promising
Keep your wits about you mate
i have been studying crocodile behavior all my life and i know exactly what signs to look for
here we go
this is it
Look at this classic slide
Big belly mark
two feet
Look
this makes him about that wide
Straight up here
Foot marks
he came down through here
there is the slide
Feet marks
Straight down in there
and this is a recent slide
with this evidence the crocodile must be close
Real close
here we go
this is wet
that means the crocodile has come up here just moments before i got here
he is probably sitting out there camouflaged
Terri i got him
Bring the boat over here
Nuts
Come on Ter
what are you doing
he is coming
Move back
Reverse mate
i have never seen a croc this determined in my life
Sui stay there
if he comes over i will top jaw him
he is at the back of the boat
Get ready with the oar
this croc must have taken a hammering from the locals
to be this aggressive he must have been tormented something shocking
my guess is he was shot at by poachers maybe even trapped by them then got away
this bloke is one angry naughty aggressive crocodile and this is going to be one very dangerous capture
Crikey
he is wild all right
Come on then
do not miss
this is very very dangerous
one slip by Steve and this croc could have his hand
this animal could even flip our small boat over with no trouble at all
Crikey he is angry
Man he is aggressive
he is blowing bubbles
he is very aggressive
i think i have got him
he is got enough strength to pull Steve clean out of the boat
no he spat it
Hold your ground
i thought i had him that time
i have never tried to rope a crocodile in the middle of a river like this
he is grumpy and he is powerful
he is coming in
we can not keep doing this
i nearly got him
no he nearly got us
if he comes in the boat it will be easier to rope him
Get ready to gun the boat
if i get the rope on him keep some weight on it
Come on
Come on mate
Come on
Crikey
Go babe go
Go with him but do not get in front of him
can you believe this
Being towed by a 12 footer
if we can stay with him long enough he is bound to get tired
that is it
that is a good pace
this bloke's got attitude
i do not know whether i have got him or he is got me
Suddenly the rope went slack
he is stopped
Probably run out of steam
but i do not trust him
Lost him
it is coming back
Get the boat over here
that crocodile nearly got me Sui
now she is gone slack
it looks like he is thrown the top jaw rope
Babe stay with him
Stay with him
this bloke's going flat out like a lizard drinking
we are in for the ride of our lives
Keep up with him Terri
Crikey
this croc is never going to give up
Just stay with him babe
he is steamin'
i have never seen a crocodile with so much determination and power
and it seems he knows exactly where he is taking us
Straight up that small creek
here we go
Watch it
no wonder these modern day dinosaurs have survived over 60 million years
they are just so cunning
no
Crikey
Duck
Stay with him babe
Get up
i got him
this croc's smart
Real smart
but he is running out of water and steam
he is shot up this creek to give us the flick
Go babe go
he is cornered
he is cornered
Take this rope
okay i got it
Take it
he is backing me up
Go
Pull
Hurry up Ter
what are you doing
he is moving too much
Hang on to him
he is tired mate
Get his bottom jaw
i need a stick
now this side
Hang on to him
i am good mate
Come on
Get it near my teeth
i do not need the stick
no you do not
now get it under the other top jaw rope
i need to use my fingers okay
Coming over the top
okay i got it
Go
Hang on
Come on big boy
Let's go for that bank
here we go again
you okay
he is breaking me neck
Flip the boat off me
i am losing him
Move your legs sweetheart
Get off the boat
Move
Sui up
Come on big boy
Let's go back
Top jaw rope
Pull it that way
i know
Sui up
Get up
Good girl
he will react when i fire this up
you all right
yeah
the only thing left to do now is to take this the apex predator as far away from here as possible
Slip the blindfold up under my arm
you all right
yeah
Drive the boat
Ansell
Archer and Wheeler are close to recovery
i can get the beacon before they set foot in the water
Keep me in the loop
this is where the last clear signal came from
it must be in the water
that would explain the transmission disruption
Wait i am getting a signal
then it is in the water or someone already has it
it is headed this way
is that an outboard
See anything
you won't believe this
Give me that
Get Reynolds
the binoculars have picked up the Discovery Channel
and you wanted to keep this a low key operation
Run
Did you hear that
Gunshots
Just ahead
could only be poachers
Settle down mate
Settle down
no wonder this poor old crocodile is so aggressive
we must get him out of this river system or he won't survive
we are going for the truck
so i want you to jump on the croc with all your weight
two three go
Hit it mate
you all right
i got him
Call it if you come unglued
okay
Poachers are the bane of my existence
Once we get this crocodile safe and sound i am going to come back here and give them a Steve o education
Crocodiles are not evil ugly monsters waiting to kill people
no way
they deserve respect and conservation
Trespassing is enough reason to be shot
but having a go at my dogs
Well
now that is a lynching crime
Ma'am they were trying to rip us apart
Kinder than leaving the job to me
we work for the government
you those useless croc catchers Sam Flynn sent for
that is us
we are looking for crocs
Seen any recently
Let's take a little run up to the house
Call Sam Flynn
See what he thinks about this
Why do not you and Jo go
we will stay here and keep searching
you get in the bike
my dogs will stay here and keep you two company
this is why i constantly tell you to expect the unexpected
yes sir
what have we got
we have put together a brief overview of the suspects
this background check indicates that they have been actively in the field on assignment since 1992
the areas they frequent are always remote and highly sensitive
for example in 1996'97 the lrwins were in lndonesia during the political unrest
they were also traveling in various parts of South America in'97 and were present for two coups
In'98 they were in Kenya when our embassy was targeted and in East Timor in'99 just after the civil war
In'99 and 2000 the lrwins had full access to military personnel and property on U S Air Force bases in Eglin Florida and Luke Arizona
our conclusion
Too many locations with highly sensitive situations for this to be coincidence
and now our agents in northern Australia have reported that the lrwins beat them to the beacon which we believe is in their possession
Maybe they were just out filming and picked up this hardware by mistake
no
Look at this
in 2001 the lrwins announced that their zoo in Australia was undergoing a 40 million expansion plan
you do not make that kind of money on cable television
in you go
Lid
Usually we relocate crocodiles back in the same river system but out of harm's way
but this croc we are going to have to drive over the mountains to a completely new river system
the poachers are going to persist until they get him
and this croc is game
Real game
two three up
Come forward
that is it
Dad and i had learned that the only way to transport crocs successfully is to hold them in a wooden crate where they can not hurt themselves or us
and they arrive at their destination with minimal stress and ready for a quick release
this croc has proven that he has no fear of man
and that is dangerous for the croc
Real dangerous
Leave it
Look but do not touch
do you mind if i wash up
do not run the water too long
we only got tanks out here
Sam Flynn
so you send three city slickers to do a job i could have done with one bullet
the beacon's still moving
they are getting further away
one of us has to make a run for the car
i used this on my last assignment with the Arctic wolves
Did it work
most of the time
but it can exert the opposite motivation
Meaning
they will attack
the two blokes look like they have never been out of an office
the girl might chip a fingernail if she is not careful
Turn the damn water off
Hang on a second
i think one of them's taking a bath
Water's worth more than gold out here
what are you doing in there
Brozzie you there
Brozzie
Mongrel
the croc guy's moved a long way from the river
we will have to go like hell to catch him
but they are moving slowly
this road will get us right behind them
Once we are on them it is gonna be a very sensitive situation
i think it is time we got what we came for
Fair dinkum we are always rescuing animals
our truck's startin' to fill up
we got Sui the dog Joey Kangaroo bird eating spider king brown snake and a crocodile to release over the mountain at the Thomson River
we have got company
they are in a hurry
a real hurry
with animals on board we should pull over and let them pass
yeah
i do not want to stress the crocodile more than i have to
he is been through enough for one day
Crikey
These blokes are mad
Real mad
with all that gunfire earlier this must be the poachers
Steve i do not think we should stop
These blokes mean business
they probably know we have got the croc on board and they want it
Crikey
i have never seen poachers this persistent
These blokes will stop at nothing
here quick babe take the wheel
Try not to hit any bumps
be careful Steve
Remember you have got a croc on board
this bloke's trespassing on my territory
Haven't they got a cheek
Steady mate
this bloke's off the Richter scale
Crikey
Lucky my wife's such a good driver
you have been upsetting my croc mate
they never know when to let go do they
is not he gorgeous
this is where your journey ends mate
Danger
See ya
Well that is one poacher that just learned a valuable Steve o lesson
do not muck with it
okay babe i am coming back in
Mongrel
Come back here with my plane you wanker
you okay
Thought you said there was nothing to worry about in Australia
Lucky it is such a friendly country
anything broken
nothing retribution won't fix
Good
Let's go
Let's find my gun first
one two three pull
Pull
Hang onto him
he is quieted down enough
i am going to the truck
be quick
you okay
Yup
we managed to give the poachers the slip
but i will be much happier when we get this bloke into his new territory
Check this out
Croc poo
this animal's been stressed
Real stressed
those poachers have a lot to answer for
what the heck is this
no wonder the croc's been cranky
Look like some kind of metal object
Crocs can digest fur feather and bone but not metal
Even a beer can will kill them
Looks like some kind of kid's top or something
People need to be more careful when they discard their rubbish
it is articles like this which is decimating our wildlife
i am gonna take this back and study it a bit later on
Ter hang onto this for us
I'd love to get my hands on the owner
Sui in the boat
no
Brozzie
Brozzie
Help
i am in the bathroom
i am in here you idiot
Sugar
no
they are back on the river
Check their truck
i will get the boat
Motor's still warm
they think they have given us the slip
there is a baby kangaroo in here
and some left over takeout food
Good shot
i guess they know now they did not give us the slip
what is going on down there
i am at the Thomson River
i have been balled up by a gun wielding rancher and chased by wild dogs
Get rid of everything
do not worry
i won't leave any evidence
Sam get that idiot Brozzie Drewitt out of there before she kills someone
Thanks
i appreciate that
Good thing so many people hate you
Six neighbors called to complain about your dangerous flying
i figure your plane's headed to the Thomson River
another thing to figure on i am billing you for the cost of my barn
this will be the crocodile's new home
we can not risk it any further
by the sound of gunfire they are right behind us
Safest place for this bloke is back in the drink
Just go forward
Sui go for the bank
Sui can sense that it is safer on the riverbank
she knows that any minute this crocodile could death roll or head shake and send us into the water
we do not want to tip the boat over
Grab the top jaw ropes
his eyes are uncovered
Watch he doesn't head bash you he will snap your legs
Just one loop round
i am going with the other one
should i cover his eyes
no mate
okay
you ready
i am going in
Hey big boy
we are doing it
Sit there with your hands on his eyes
that is great
now comes the dangerous bit
Big boy you are almost home
you are almost there
there he goes
not yet
Keep the strain on
this is dangerous for me and the crocodile
if the croc gets away now his jaws are tied shut and he'd never survive
and if i am not fast enough when i cut the rope i could lose a hand or worse
here big boy
you are free
there he goes
yes
Job done
Let's head for home
Steve i think i hear a motor
could be the poachers
Let's get Sui and pretend we have still got the croc
Sui's worked with me all her life
as long as she can see me she will wait for us
she is been me best mate for 13 years helping me catch hundreds of crocodiles and dealing with countless poachers and wildlife perpetrators
we should not have any trouble giving these blokes the slip
if we can fool them into thinking we have still got the croc we can lead them away from here on a wild goose chase
it is those same two blokes
Hundreds of miles of river and they are on us again
no croc would stand a chance against them
Ter spin around mate
this look like i am laying on a croc
if we can lure them far enough away our croc will stand a chance
we have got a more powerful outboard
they won't catch up
have a go at this
Crikey
Hold her steady
Did you see that
must be a poacher war
and we are in the middle of it
Throwing that dynamite might kill our croc
we can not have that
Let me at them
this is getting very dangerous
Holy smokes
These blokes are serious
Let's get out of here
Hang on
another coat of paint and we'd be history
he is coming back
that is it
i am getting grumpy now
Ter take over
Ter let me take over
Brace yourself
Take a look at this
Sweating bullets
we are out of here
have a go at this
if they stay in the water long enough the hunters will become the hunted
that is nature's way
we have received a communiqu from Australia
it seems the mission was less than a success
Unfortunately we are going to have to call in the Defense Department
i do not like to say this but it doesn't look like she survived
the police will have to drag the river
Waste of money
she is probably out there watching us
or maybe a croc got her
Come on Brozzie it is his territory
Leave him be
Settle down
Just habit
i won't hurt him
at least not while she is still in the water anyway
but i will tell you one thing
if she sets foot on land well that is my dogs' territory
i suggested that one of the operatives be from my group
we had no idea dirty laundry was involved until it was too late
this is going to put our operations on the front page of every newspaper
since you have kept an eye on everything you won't need a briefing
Gentlemen i think the question is where do we go from here
Reynolds has just thrown some good agents to the dogs
the agency should invest in waterproofing
the way things are going i am ready for you to shoot me
no you are not getting off that easy
yeah
nothing at this point is gonna faze me
Damn
Jo Buckley
Tomorrow all hell will break loose
Reynolds has called in the Pentagon
he is been appointed to lead the investigation
what do you want me to do
Disappear
and you
i can take care of myself
if not for that caped crusader in shorts I'd have the top job now
they won't trace it back to me
i am too clever for Reynolds
Mr Ansell step out of the car
you are under arrest
Wanker
that guy in the khaki shorts
that dude on the Discovery Channel
Send in the Marines the Air Force the Rangers
Just pick up that ball
what a steamer
to think something the size of this carelessly discarded by thoughtless people could cause so much potential damage to our innocent native wildlife
Please dispose of junk like this wisely
okay Sui get it
Animals everywhere need our help and protection to survive if they will make it into the future
this has been one heck of an adventure
we tossed a couple gorgeous snakes rescued the most beautiful gnarly old crocodile and we taught those pesky poachers a Steve o lesson
what more could a bloke ask for
Crikey
my eye
those army blokes seemed pretty upset about their metal ball
they reckoned it was more valuable
Son of a gun
of all the gear they get to play with
and again
You'd think the last thing
You'd think the last
those army blokes seemed upset about their metal ball
they reckoned it was real valuable
of all the gear they get to play with you'd think they would not need a kid's top
and that grumpy rancher has joined the Fauna and Fisheries Department as a volunteer
but she is still having trouble dealing with crocodiles
and check this out
the U S government gave us those two poachers to work at Australia Zoo for nothing
i reckon after i give them a full Steve o education we will be able to return them to the wild where they belong
and that crocodile's happy
Real happy
he is got himself a couple of gorgeous looking Sheilas
Well we are back to our adventure
See ya
yes
i think i got it
Did i get it
Tell me i got it
Fifty nine Crikey take one
Mark it
Mark it
Mark it and put it away
and action
i know how to do it
Crikey

Harris Ryland's in critical condition
Danko
Mrs Ewing did you have anything to do with the shooting
i shot Harris Ryland
i know my track record is not the best
i want to earn your trust
John Ross
i need you to dig up some dirt on Elena's brother Drew Ramos
he is always had a nose for trouble
Clyde
he is definitely up to something
i am not sure what but it doesn't look legal
Vicente
is this some kind of a joke
you are going to prison vicente
J R
Life is cheap in prison and i am a very rich man
so am i
Your son is in bed with Pamela Barnes
you got feelings for this girl
Your guy Frank
he is got a deal with J R
they are conspiring against your daughter
Why are you helping me
to protect our deal
Your honor i met Tommy Sutter about two years ago
i shot and killed him
Forgive me
i love you for doing this but you have to let me take responsibility
Mr Ryland you remember what happened
it was Bobby Ewing
he shot me
Monitor beeping
what are you doing
you can not come in here
Security
Wake up you sick son of a bitch
how dare you pin this on Bobby
Tell them the truth damn it
Tell the police it was me
i shot you
oh come on now Annie
Your husband's more than willing to take the fall to protect you
i am just trying to show him my support
no what you are trying to do is punish me
Bobby was gonna tell the truth
i was gonna take responsibility
You'd best leave if you know what is good for you
you have taken my daughter
you want my husband now too
where does it end Harris
all these sick twisted games
Well we have all made our choices haven't we
Security
this is the price you have to pay for yours
Security
for thinking you could live in a world without my tender loving care
Finally
where have you been
Come on her
Get her out of here
if your heart weren't so small you'd be dead
Man
Let's go ma'am
i wish you were dead
you have to leave
i am going to the police
i am gonna confess
who do you think they are gonna believe
you or the victim here
Ma'am this way
Kiss Bobby goodbye for me will you
Emma
Come on
Breathing heavily
my name is Ann Ewing and i shot Harris Ryland   Theme music plays  
DALLAS S02 Ep05 Trial and error
Sync and corrected by dr jackson for www addic7ed com
Dad
if you knew it was my mother who shot you why did you tell the police it was Mr Ewing
Well i
Well when the police interviewed me honey
i i had just come out of a coma
not to mention the emergency surgery the medication the transfusion
and i guess the combination of things just kind of confused me a bit
as for your mother i am
i am sorry you had to witness her true nature today
God knows i have tried to shield you from it for all these years
anyway it is it is not something for you to worry about
or your place to question
i am sorry i
i did not understand
Well that is all right
Cliff
Three people dead
one of whom i considered as my son and all because you allowed your heart to dictate your actions
i feel horrible about Frank daddy
i know this is all my fault
Perhaps i should have paid more attention to you over the years
of course now you are desperately looking for love with men who can only use you
i know i screwed up but John Ross is gonna help me get control of the methane after the divorce
it is not just the methane that we need
it is Ewing Energies
Lock stock and barrel
and for the life of me i can not figure out why you'd want to play another Ewing in this
John Ross is as machiavellian as his father
there won't be any more mistakes
any more emotions getting in the way
where have i heard that before
Sighs
Cows mooing in distance
Lew
okay
the blood trace and carpet fibers found on those boots appear to be sufficient evidence for the D A' s office to dismiss Ryland's false charges against you Bobby and to indict Ann
oh thank God
Ann honey
i needed to do it
i mean you did not shoot him and i could not let Harris get away with another lie
yeah well we are past that
what we have to do now is find a way to get her out from under these charges Lew
yeah
i think we need to plead not guilty go for jury nullification
the same plan i had for you except that Ann's defense gives me a lot more leeway
here is the deal
we put up a sudden passion defense
Ann's actions the result of extreme provocation duress and a whole array of mitigating circumstances
and when the truth comes out any jury in their right mind will understand
they won't convict you
Your daughter deserves to hear the full story Ann
Emma was unwilling to listen before
Maybe now in court she will
Ann
Exhales deeply
Cows mooing
Cellphone rings
Cellphone beeps
Good mornin'
Good morning
Wow i think that is the nicest thing you have ever said to me J R
what do you want Barnes
Want
from you
not a plugged nickel
Just wanted to let you know how nice it was to finally see your son after all these years
Say what
Well he gave me a heads up about you and Frank
Thought you'd like to know who sold you out
you go to hell Barnes
Chuckling
Well i would but seems like you have cornered that market
Cellphone beeps
my God
Camera shutters clicking
Reporters shouting indistinctly
Woman
do you think he is gonna survive
Shouting continues
Lew
no questions guys please
no questions at this time please
Ann please just one comment
Please
something
Indistinct conversations
Sensitivity doesn't seem to be their strong point does it
Child's play
you should see how they carry on at Ewing Energies
anyway you have my full support here
Thank you mother
that means a lot to me
the judge has granted an exception to the prosecution allowing them to call Ryland to testify whenever he is deemed medically fit
but he is not here yet okay
Thank God
be strong
Bailiff
all rise
Court is now in session
the honorable judge Wallace Tate presiding
be seated
all right felony case number F12 6555 Z the state of Texas vs Ann Ewing
the charge attempted murder
Having heard all preliminary motions is the prosecution ready to begin
we are your honor
then you may proceed Ms Garson
the state calls Judith Ryland
Judith
my son fell head over heels with Ann Smith despite my warnings that she was nothing but a gold digger and an opportunist
but he had always been sheltered and once she had him in her clutches she began spending our money staying out late
Picking up men
that is not true
Harris thought a child would tame her teach her to love something outside her own selfish indulgences
but once she got pregnant all Ann wanted was an abortion
Objection your honor
Suffice it to say living with Ann became a heartbreaking ordeal for my son
Objection
Hearsay your honor
the witness only lived with my client and Mr Ryland briefly
is this true Mrs Ryland
i was there frequently enough to witness her manipulations sexual and otherwise
is that a yes or a no
Garson
she lived within walking distance of her son's residence your honor
Harris only had me move out because she forced him
Ms Garson you need to redirect your questioning
Garson
but your honor
the witness was also party to the custodial interference that runs to the core of this case so her testimony is biased at best
we were protecting the child
Ann loathed being a mother
some people should not have goldfish let alone children
Judge Tate
all right i agree with counsel
the witness shall step down now
Judge if you silence me who will be my son's advocate in this courtroom
that is enough Mrs Ryland
i will hold you in contempt
i hold her in contempt
Bailiff would you please remove the witness
the jury shall disregard all the testimony following defense counsel's objection
the court calls for a 15 minute recess
Ringing
Come on
Cellphone rings
Cellphone beeps
Clyde
hello
Clyde what is going on
our boy is on the move again
our man Drew has made four freight runs down to laredo and back always switching trucks at a stop in Webb county
Mama put a morals clause in Elena's contract
if there is any felonious behavior by Elena or her employees that is grounds for termination of the agreement
Fortunately for you her brother's come home ridin' dirty
Take him down Clyde
Cellphone beeps
Engine turns over
what the hell
no no no Christopher do not
to testify the same day or the next day
Testify for what
Ann's allowing miss Barnes to be a character witness
are you kidding me
that is the last thing we need Lew
someone up on the stand who is defrauded the entire Ewing family
Christopher
Save it for family court
i agree with Lew
we do not need to be doing this right now
for what it is worth
Ann's the only Ewing that never turned her back on me
she is the last person I'd want to hurt
this coming from someone with blood on their hands
i know you had something to do with Tommy's murder directly or indirectly
what we both know is that Tommy was a bad guy
he threatened me
he hurt me
you do not remember the bruises Christopher
Well they were doled out while i was already pregnant
with your babies
what are you saying
Read between the lines
and if you can not if you just want to keep vilifying me and pursuing this merciless witch hunt then you know what
i will just pack up and move Barnes Global to Bermuda
and these babies you are so eager to strip from my womb
you will never see them at all
Indistinct shouting
Thank you
for what
i know it was you who went to my father to warn him about Frank
how he was trying to set me up
i was protecting our business arrangement
my father he um
he loved Frank
and maybe deep down i hated Frank for that
Hey do not go there
do not put that on yourself
what
Sighs
my father thinks we are no good for each other
mine too
to hell with them
Let's get dinner tonight
no
it is not a good idea
Am i missing something here
nothing personal
Just protecting our business arrangement
Air brakes hiss
Engine shuts off
Bells jingling
Bells jingling
Elevator bell dings
what the hell is the matter with you J R
Well i am sure you will fill me in
is forgiveness beyond you
John Ross had his reasons for going to Cliff and if you have to know
i gave him Cliff's private number
so if you want to blame anyone blame me
for the life of me i can not think of one sensible reason for our boy to go and seek favor from that bitter old bastard
Fathers are supposed to take the high road when it comes to their sons
Forgive John Ross
Christopher
you hear anything from the bailiff
no
15 minutes went by 15 minutes ago
i know
i do not know what is going on
what the hell
Ellis
Bobby
Hey
Hey Bobby
now before you sound off as a courtesy to the Venezuelan consulate the U S attorney's office has granted Mr Cano an extradition hearing
Why
so he can take off
the man's a murderer for Christ's sake
oh Christopher you are so judgmental
Very unattractive
and do not forget
we still have some unfinished business to conclude huh
Ellis that man killed that woman who was pretending to be Marta del Sol and when J R' s son was in jail he put a contract out on him
John Ross was almost beaten to death
and now he gets a pass by way of diplomatic immunity
he doesn't get a pass or immunity
Worst case scenario
he faces life in prison for capital murder in Venezuela
Scoffs
Garson
Tell us about the surveillance video that was entered into evidence Detective
we have footage of Ann Ewing driving her Chevy Tahoe and entering the driveway going to and from Mr Ryland's property
and how long was Ann Ewing's to and from Detective
Time code shows a 5 minute 20 second interval
the blood and fibers on her boots confirming that she entered Harris Ryland's residence
yes
Carrying a concealed weapon that ballistics later confirmed as her own weapon
a Smith Wesson 5906 9mm which she fired at her ex husband
that is correct
so then Detective Danko what in your experience does the crime scene evidence and this short timeframe suggest to you
that the shooting was deliberate premeditated
Garson
Dr Lefont as the trauma surgeon operating on our victim Harris Ryland can you describe for us the injuries he sustained as a result of the shooting
Mr Ryland was struck by a single gunshot to the chest the bullet striking the fourth rib which deflected it downward severing the intercostal artery
if the bullet had entered one centimeter higher it would have fractured the rib and punctured the heart killing him
in your experience is a single gunshot wound indicative of a crime of sudden passion
Objection
Calls for speculation
Speculation from an experienced forensic pathologist and trauma surgeon
i will allow it
no a sudden passion is far far messier
the victim would have either multiple stab wounds or several blunt force blows to the head and body
and as for shootings a victim of sudden passion would have multiple gunshot wounds
and a single gunshot wound
what is that indicative of in most cases
an execution
Spectators murmuring
Sighs
Siren wailing
Afternoon officer
Afternoon
Know you got a busted out taillight
uh no sir i did not know that
have to ask you to step out with your license registration and cargo manifest please
and where is your certification stamp
uh i do not have any certification stamp
this is all they gave me
who is they
i do not know
i just drive
Give me your keys sir
Keys
Open it up
Door opens
Man
what is that
the manifest says car parts
this looks like smuggled goods from China
on your knees
now
Hands behind your head
both hands
how long have you known Ann Ewing
we first met when she volunteered to work for my foundation's equestrian program for battered and abused women and children
she was so
so patient so gentle
and kind
she always saw the best in me even when i could not see it myself
and as to what happened at the Ryland residence
the only way it makes sense to me is she must have been cornered or seriously provoked
i know
i have been there
Thank you Ms Barnes
no further questions your honor
Cellphone vibrating
everything okay
yeah but i better take this
all right
Vibrating continues
Elevator bell dings
no
no no no
i am here i am here
what do you mean no paperwork
Drew seriously
Elena
Transporting stolen goods
Drew
i thought it was a legit outfit okay
a legit gig
of course you did
this is unbelievable
i swear i did not know what the cargo was
i just wanted to bank some extra cash
and i just wanted to believe that now that you were sober you were smarter too
Trouble found me this time elli
i did not go looking for it
Sighs
i know you do not believe this but i came home to make things right
Sit tight
i will find a local lawyer
i will post your bail
i will pay you back
you are damn right you will
Toilet flushes
could you give me a minute son
you know your mother is of the opinion that
i should forgive you for consorting with the enemy
and since staying on Sue Ellen's good side is the prudent thing to do at the moment
i am inclined to oblige
i do not need your forgiveness
you do not need my wrath either
we dinosaurs are known to bite
Cellphone vibrates
Sighs
something i should know
Drew Ramos just got arrested down in waco for the receipt and transport of stolen goods
he is now being booked at central jail
Really
Well that puts our ambitious little seorita in moral violation of her contract with your mother doesn't it
Wonderful
you knew about that
the morals clause
you still do not know who you are dealing with do you son
i can hardly blame you for that
but i forgive you
Garson
the prosecution calls Harris Ryland to the stand
Wheels squeaking
Grunts
Grunts
Thank you
Judge Tate
Mr Ryland do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
yes sir i do
so on the day of the shooting Mr Ryland what happened
Well i was sitting in my study
then Ann came storming in asking questions about Emma
when i did not give her the right answers she opened up her purse pulled out a gun and shot me point blank
Let's go back to the beginning to the crux of your ex wife's resentment
the custodial interference
what led you to take such extraordinary action
Sighs
i fell head over heels for a willowy young woman that i tried to save
i gave her the moon and the stars hoping that she'd settle down but Sighs
the truth was that
the truth was that she just was not ready to be a mother
the first time she abandoned Emma i was at work my mother was having outpatient surgery
Ann left Emma at the house by herself while she went out
with some friends
when i got home
my little girl was hungry crying hysterically sitting in dirty diapers
no it did not happen that way
Counselor
Ann
and when did your wife finally come home Mr Ryland
it was after midnight
she was drunk
my mother and i lived in fear for Emma after that
Let's move to the day of the Texas state fair
Well i just found out that morning that Ann had suddenly decided to take Emma to it
She'd been acting strange and my instincts told me something was wrong so i left work and went to look for them
and i spotted them by the petting zoo
and then i watched as
Ann walked away from our child
she just turned her back on our daughter and just kept right on walking abandoned her right there in the middle of a crowd
i knew right then and there that i had to take my baby girl to protect her
Even if it meant breaking the law
the law be damned
i knew that somewhere down the road that my daughter was gonna be hurt by her own mother and i just could not take that chance
so i did what any father would do
i took my child out of harm's way
Ann
Bobby Sighs
Please look at me
is any of what Ryland said out there true
some of it
i need Emma to hear my truth Bobby
i need you to hear it
i was a tall awkward girl
most of my life i felt ugly
my mother took me to doctors when i hit puberty so they would make me stop growing
no one had really ever paid any attention to me
Until Harris
my family did not have much money and Harris took me to fancy restaurants stores bought me nice clothes
we were happy
he had grown up in a suffocating home
his father had committed suicide before he was born and his mother controlled his every breath
Harris kept telling me how good i was for him that i brought light into the dark of his life
then his mother began to interfere
nothing i could do was right
she made fun of the fact that I'd never gone to college
she put ideas in his head about me
that i was a gold digger that i was seeing other men
and he believed her
so he began trying to control me the way he had always been controlled
if i picked the wrong blouse picked up the wrong fork did my hair a certain way he'd shout at me
i began to realize that the marriage had been a mistake
when i found out i was pregnant i felt trapped
by the time Emma was born i felt like i was drowning
i was diagnosed with post partum depression and put on medication
i had a difficult time being a young mother
i am sorry
but i did not leave my daughter at home alone
i left Emma with Judith so i could go see a divorce lawyer
but Judith lied to Harris for her own twisted purposes
then Harris found out about my plans to divorce him and he forced me to see a psychiatrist who put me on more medication
Tell us what happened at the state fair
Emma was 18 months old
Harris and his mother were particularly cruel to me the night before so that morning
i took a few more pills than i should have
i could not think straight but i could not stand to be in that house another minute so i took Emma to the fair
it was so very hot
i remember being so thirsty
so i left her in her stroller and went to get a soda
Only a couple minutes passed
i turned back and she was gone
i had stepped away from my baby for only a few moments and she'd been kidnapped
God had punished me by taking my baby
Breathing raggedly
Emma
hi
i am Christopher Ann's stepson
i know
may i sit
that is not a good idea
my father and grandmother are gonna be right back
you know i was watching you when your mother was giving her testimony
you know you are the same age as she was when this all went down
when she lost you at that state fair
i am aware of that
Emma
i know how much you love your father and i know how difficult and painful this all must be for you
but your mother she could go to jail for 20 years because your father pushed her to do something she should not have done
Look i am not trying to put words in your mouth here but if you want to help make things right for you and your mother tell the truth
not somebody else's version of it
Your truth
Please go
all right
Garson
the state calls as a rebuttal witness
Emma Ryland to the stand
Miss Ryland you witnessed your mother Ann Ewing barge into your father's hospital room and admit to shooting him
is that correct
Sighs
i um
i was actually out in the hall
but you heard her admit it
you heard her say in so many words that she wished she had killed him
i am looking for a yes or no here miss Ryland
yes
yes she said she shot him not her husband and that she wished he was dead
can you think of any reason any cause any justification for your mother to commit this crime
no
she said my father has a small heart but he has the biggest heart in the world
he taught me to ride dressage helped me become a champion
he risked going to jail to protect me
and now i know why
i love my father
and i wake up every morning grateful that he rescued me from my mother
it is okay
Thank you
nothing further your honor
Judge Tate
Let's take a 15 minute recess
you know after everything that is gone on here
you are right
i do not want our kids to be raised with their parents poisoning their minds against each other
i will agree to mediation
i think it is the right thing to do
so do i
Good
oh
Inhales sharply
Hey you okay
yeah
yeah it is just when they kick at the same time
you have been sticking to all your check ups right
i mean there is nothing i should know as far as their health is concerned
yes and and no
everything is fine
they are just really kicking in there
it is okay
Come here
Breathing raggedly
Cliff
i hear you got Christopher to the table
now that is thinking with your head instead of your heart
Come here
this divorce is gonna be good for business
i always knew you could do it
i am so very proud of you
Thank you daddy
i have heard they have wonderful pies here
i will see if i can get us some
Bobby
Thank you Sue Ellen
Silence is golden in these situations Ann
the longer the jury stays out the better
Did you hear her on the stand
yeah
she is been brainwashed
Like me back then
Only Harris and Judith have had 20 years to break her spirit
Hey we are not giving up on Emma
if i am not around
you will be around
the only truth that jury heard was from our side of the courtroom
Just have some faith honey
it is gonna work out
Cellphone rings
Cellphone beeps
yeah this is Lew Rosen
yes
Thanks
they are back
Court'll reconvene first thing in the morning
Judge Tate
has the jury reached a verdict
we have your honor
on the one count of attempted murder how do you find the defendant
we find the defendant Ann Ewing guilty your honor
Spectators murmuring
Mrs Ewing you will be remanded into formal custody until your sentencing hearing
Bailiff if you would
Bobby
Annie
Turn around please
we will figure it out
we will

Dear audience ladies and gentlemen
we are located on the country estate of Miss Sophie
for privacy reasons the first name of this ancient race is not reported
Miss Sophie has invited her four best friends to a birthday dinner
and this is the seating arrangement
but there is a little difficulty
Miss Sophie is not the youngest lady
she celebrates her 90th birthday and outlived her best friends a long time ago
she has buried her last friend 25 years ago
Nevertheless Miss Sophie would not renounce her birthday dinner
and because the gentlemen for understandable reasons cannot personally attend the dinner they will be represented by Miss Sophie's butler James
the procedure for this dinner has not changed for years
James will keep asking
Same procedure as last year
and Miss Sophie will reply again and again
Same procedure as every year
with an emphasis on every year
the ongoing conversation between Miss Sophie and her butler James is rather not interesting
so you won't have a hard time to follow the dialog of the most unusual birthday dinner that has ever existed
Ladies and gentlemen i hope you will enjoy this dinner
and here is James

Sure this is the fastest way to Grand Central Station
i do not know
that is what Melman said
Hey
Hey you guys
that room has some nifty little sinks you can wash up in and look
Free mints
this is not a field trip
this is an urgent mission to save Marty from throwing his life away

i asked you to talk to him
i did
i did
i do not understand
he said Let's go
i said are you crazy
he says i am ten years old
and he has black and white stripes and so then we sang and
what you got to do is go straight back down West 42nd

you are so annoying
now for as long as we can remember we have been attacked and eaten by the dreaded fossa
the fossa
the fossa are attacking
it is a cookbook
it is a cookbook
Please
Maurice
Quiet
Come on y'all
they are not attacking us this very instant
so my genius plan is this
we will make the New York giants our friends and keep them close
then with Mr Alex protecting us we will be safe and never have to worry about the dreaded fossa ever again
i thought of that
i thought of that
yes
me
i did
Hold on everybody
Hold on
i am just thinking now
i mean does anyone wonder why the fossa were so scared of Mr Alex
i mean maybe we should be scared too
what if Mr Alex is even worse than the fossa
i tell you that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies
Maurice you did not raise your hand
therefore your heinous comment will be stricken from the record
does anyone else have the heebie jeebies
no
Good
so shut up
when the New York giants wake up we will make sure that they wake up in paradise
now who would like a cookie
Yo Al
Melman and Gloria are over there having a good time
there is room on the fun side for one more
no thanks
Look i have been thinking
Maybe if you gave this place a chance
i do not know you might even enjoy yourself
Marty i am tired
i am hungry
i just want to go home
could you just give it a chance
Think about it
it really is not the fun side without you
i know
and then
it is him
who is it
it is the pizza man
who the heck do you think it is
yes
can i help you
can i come to the fun side
Beg your pardon

Sita is picking it up very fast
i wish she would learn classical music

Maybe her future lies in music

Sure

Come
Aviram where are you

Chaitanya come
Why do you frighten the children
i did not
she just chanced to be on my way
what is your name
Sita
where do you live
in my new home
Come i will reach you home
have you read the Ramayana
no
it is the story about Sita
in Mithila there was a king called Janak
one day while ploughing the empty fields he found a baby girl
Sita
Sita truly is the earth's daughter
the very same Sita one day went back into the arms of the earth
the earth parted in two and took Sita within its bosom
now that was much later
in between the 7 chaptered Ramayana
i will hear the whole story one day
after this many years passed
Salute
you are not paying heed to what Budhan says
i am telling you his wife will have a son
Give him 7 days leave to go to his home
Go to the manager
where is the manager
Hasn't he come yet
what else am i saying
Come
Haven't you heard the news
what is happened
since yesterday the Manager has gone mad
as soon he sees humans he growls and tries to bite them
they have taken him to Calcutta by last night's train
who is the letter from
Rambilas
the manager has retired
from today i am the manager
it is a great promotion for you
i will go and inform Sita and about Budhan
i will see to it

the new manager the owner's friend
See the dawn is coming
the people wake up
the breeze wakes up
the birds wake up
the sky appears
oh
Shyam
Why did you still lie asleep
where were you
Awake all night
See the dawn is breaking
Suddenly it seems that you have really grown up
and you are becoming tiny everyday
you went to work without having anything
where does your mind wander
do not scold me let's go
Why do you always sing such sad songs
it seems for the both of you there is nothing but sadness and suffering
an article written by Aviram appeared in the papers
i felt happy seeing his name in print but was shocked while reading
People do not like these
Show things that are beautiful
Only then people will see listen and read
i do not think that carefully when i sing brother
oh
have you read the last letter of Aviram
oh
no
his final exams are over
he says he won't be able to come home
he is going on a trip with his friends
i felt dejected after reading it
for exams he has not been able to come for a year
he has worked hard
Let him roam about
Lets go inside there is something to discuss
the Mukherjees will have dinner with us
Why
the old manager has retired now i am the manager that is why they want a party
oh
you have become the manager
but today the market is closed
you take rest
i will try to arrange something
hi Avi you wrote that you will travel around with friends
did not feel like it
i had been working hard for the exams
so i thought i would come here for a rest as there is plenty of time before the results
Mukherjee is coming to dinner see if Sita needs help
Your brother is now manager
he is got ahead in life
how did your exam go
not bad
Brother i have made a deal with a big publisher to print my book
i will finish writing it here
what rubbish you write i just do not understand it
we can start our old quarrels a little later Brother
he will do well in exam
he must i have applied on his behalf to study in Germany
i will send him to Germany to study engineering
the exams are over
i am back
Why
what is why
you wrote a long letter that you would travel around with friends
did not like the idea of going alone
Silly
i have found a publisher for my first novel
i have begun writing
i have never had anything published before showing it to you
Won't you listen
to hell with you
Ah
Leave
have i hurt you
in one year you have grown up so much
the hero of my new novel is a boy who can faintly recollect his childhood
he can make out that his parents were very poor
he remembers the name of his village
but there are many villages by the same name
all he knows is that one had to cross a very vast river right on its banks was his home
since childhood he used to wonder where had he come from
he remembers his mother shivering with cold at night as they arrived at a crowded railway station
Thereafter somewhere his mother got lost
he yearned to rest his head on his mother's lap
i have not a mother but you all are there
Throughout the year i have been yearning to return home
you never wrote all these
Well
i was never able to write it down
Why i used to feel like this i have realized today
you never realized before
not at all
did not you too
no
since when have let all these remain hidden in your heart
since a long time
Let's go it is getting late
on this day there is such happiness
on the swing sways Shyam
on this day there is such happiness
is the food ready
Except the mutton
Tomorrow you see i will go out
where to
oh
yes Jharagram not in the morning in the afternoon
i will start after lunch by night it won't inconvenience you i hope
where are you going Brother
Well something has happened
i have decided but in reality i haven't
what do you say
Why are you talking senselessly
Senselessly
how is it senseless
what is it
Behaving so childishly
Untidy habits
I'd just tidied the room guests will come never do this again
what madness
Hey listen
what is it
do you remember your mother
no
then how is it that your way of scolding is exactly like hers
Walking with a stiff neck and frown upon your face
i do not know
sometimes i get startled
i feel i am being scolded by my mother again
i am your mother
you won't go away like Mother
i do not find Aviram
he has gone to buy some meat near the station
my lady
i came to learn how the preparation is progressing my wife would not let me come alone she is afraid i might marry you

Welcome my brother will be so happy to see you
what a surprise you have arrived so suddenly please sit
Sita
Sita

Coming to such a place you ought to have had more time with you
i have come with some real bad news
Haraprasad's wife committed suicide last night
what
during the last 8 years Haraprasad lost jobs from 7 schools
never could fit himself anywhere for the last 2 years he is been jobless
i have heard that he has been begging now
and the two children
their incessant cries for food made their mother hang herself
and this letter
she left it it is addressed to you
Mr Ishwar Chakraborty Chattimpur
Brother from this suffering there is no other way out
in my last moments i utter your name
if you can please save the two children
Your luckless sister Renuka
where are the two kids
Haraprasad took them away from the funeral pyre
before he left he gave me this letter and said this last letter should reach its destination
but i will not let my children be brought up by a deserter
where has he gone to
no one knows
you know what he is like he talks in riddles
in answer to me he said
Darkness cannot be the end i am going in search of light
Please do not mind since early morning the police the burning ghat rushing about the train journey please do not mind
Brother i am frightened
Why is everyone telling me that i have grown up
Crazy girl
i will never ever go anywhere
leaving you because you will suffer
Go to sleep
Sita sleeps
Sita sleeps
Aviram you have passed with good marks
Come i want to talk with you
you have passed so what will you do now
i will go to Calcutta
i have nearly completed writing it
Ha the rubbish you write
Only sadness suffering and tears even i do not like reading it
but all this is what we truly see around us
you will end up like Haraprasad

the same old clubhouse for the pilots is it still there

Won't you sit down for a while

Avi do not go to Germany
you have found truth in a certain occupation
Why should you leave it
i have been searching for something like this to give me strength

i shall not leave
what that you have put away
where did you get it from
Er r
Mrs Mukherjee gave it to me
Take it
Did you call me
yes i have sent off a reply to Germany
you will have to leave in a few days
you did not give me even a little time to think it out
no
what
Rambilas has come
Suddenly
hello
Iswar i just dropped in
Salute
my brother
Salute
Let's go to my house
Let's go
i give you 2 annas
he is giving you 2 percent share in the mill and factory as a partner
Deepak bring the papers
Let's go and see your house
have a look at the partnership papers
i really do not need to
Deepak go away
when you first came i could not give you any security
but now you have proved yourself
and it is really not possible for me to look after the mill
i have invested 50 lakhs in my export scheme
after 3 months i will go to the continent
and my wife she is become very fond of ceramic arts she wants to visit Switzerland
Come over to Calcutta after some time on an auspicious day
i will have the agreement ready
Rambilas i am so obliged to you
it is because of you that i have everything
it is business Brother
i am giving 2 percent share so you will look after the mill
Guruji has sent you his blessings
where are you going
Towards the station for a walk
Ok
Your brother
I'd thought that apart from a younger sister you have no kin
i found him when he was a child to me he is like a younger brother
what
you do not know his caste and let him stay in the house
what does that matter
everything depends on caste
it is because of such things
i have decided to contest in the election from Chhtimpur next year
Rambilas he is very good natured boy
but he might not be from a good caste
oh
another thing stop the old boiler of the mill
Why my mood has been spoiled
Come after some days to Calcutta
Mr Ishwar a calamity has occurred at the station would you come and see it
what is happened
a little ago a train full of refugees was going towards Dandakaranya two old women were taken down from the train by the guard one of them is on the point dying perhaps by now she is dead the other is probably not related to her said that the afflicted one belongs to your hometown
Bikrampur near the village Bajrajogine
is that so
yes let's go and see
in her last moments even the medical officer could do nothing
oh
Bagdibou open your eyes for once and see
what is happened Brother
a Bagdibou has died
my mother
oh
Bagdibou
Mother
before my mother passed away she told me certain facts about birth
in a moment everything changed
what shall i do now
you tell me
Whether you send him abroad or not at least send him to Calcutta
do not keep him in this village
he is a low caste boy you see
if there is talk about it here Mr Rambilas might come to know
Mr Rambilas is a very religious person all your efforts of all these years will come to naught
oh
another thing find a groom for Sita
i want to marry her off as soon as possible
what
i do not want to go to Germany
all right
what will you do
i will go to Calcutta and try for a job
if i am able to i will write
Well
some people are coming to have a look at Sita today
i am getting Sita married off soon
i want to marry Sita
she also wants it
you ought to leave by the morning train for Calcutta
Try and earn a living stand on your own feet
i will be happy if you can do that
Sita this is the sixth time i am asking you
they are waiting in the drawing room to have a look at you
Wear a good sari and come with the tea and snacks
they have been waiting for you for quite a long time
if you give way to anger it will tell on your health
i am coming
Salute
Salute
everything is set sir
they have agreed about the dowry
in the next six days there is an auspicious day
Make all arrangements for that very day
who shall i talk to about my sadness
without Mohan my heart is sad
See the dawn is here
the ten directions are waking up
See the dawn is breaking
i have a hundred qualities
Come my life's wealth
Show me the way
Come Mohan
you are being unjust Brother
a letter from Rambilas came today regarding the partnership
he has told me not to come Calcutta for the time being
he will finalize everything after he returns from abroad
he has conveyed his condolences for Aviram's mother
and he has added that i should not be shocked about Aviram's caste
Brother you never indulge in untruths
Efforts of a lifetime are right before me
Brother
Shut up
i will see to it that this marriage takes place
if something else happens
i wish you die before that
yes you will be dead
you are leaving
shall i perform the last rites of my mother in Kalighat
a few of my mother's relatives stay in that colony
i will try to find a place to stay
Bye
you have nothing else to say
i will not harm our Brother
will you harm me
Sit down
Only after 5 days is my marriage
do you know that
yes
Avi
i will go with you
i too will not harm our brother
last night he wanted that i die
Give me some time
i will go and fix up a place
everything is ready sir
the auspicious moment has come
Bring the bride
Sita has gone she will be back soon
she was writing something
a few more years passed away
Salute Sir
hello how are you
Pulling on somehow
for 6 years he is been mad
not mad he has killer's eyes
the way he was looking
i was trembling
Man has crossed the limits of the Earth's boundaries from limitless space the first Voyager's safe return
Circling for one and half hours in space around the earth
the first step in unveiling the mystery of space
the courageous and successful conquest of space by the Soviets
the triumph of human science and intelligence is seen in this the Russians have sent a man called Gagarin in outer space
in the rains he has come
the clouds thunder the lightning flashes in a shower of colours
you have such a lovely voice Sita you are wasted sitting at home
i look after the house and my child and so much running around
you can do it sitting at home
Like Reba who stays in the Southern Colony
are the paper bags ready
not even 500 yet
Binu take them out of the corner and give them to Aunty
Take this i will come the day after
Father still has not come back mother
he will be back any moment
Brother was right
no one wants to see sadness and suffering
but everyone's ready to bear them
they are suffering all around
but they do not want to hear about it
Did you go to the publisher
yes here are the manuscripts
it is risky to publish this type of writing
and the price of printing paper has gone up
there is good news
i met my class friend Anil on the way
he is got a good job with state transport
if I'd learn driving i could have got a job now
will you give up writing
Driving a bus is better than writing for nothing
when will you get it
what is the hurry
i have to learn driving and apply for the job will have to undergo training
what shall i do
all efforts have failed
Why not write to Brother for once
Binu says he gets a headache every day even at this age
Continuous semi starvation
so our Brother
i mean Brother must have a good amount in savings
before i approach him i will take Binu with me and beg on roads
i will commit suicide
i will do the worst things possible
Kajal was suggesting how would it be if i start singing
Song
yes Kajal will bring listeners to the house who will give money
what are you saying
Reba does that
do not listen to all that
Why
you won't understand it
i will be back
what did i say
Whatever i say'you won't understand'
Hey Binu your mother sings very well doesn't she
yes Mother that song about the rice fields
would you listen
yes
Mother what do rice fields look like
Listen
and you will be able to see
Today in the paddy fields
Sunlight and shadows play hide and seek who floated the white clouds in the blue skies
the bee forget to sip the honey flies around in the light
why do the birds meet on the banks of the river
i shall not go back home shall not go back home
i will break the skies as under and spread around nature
i won't go back home today
how late is the night
no answer comes forth
Carry on i will be following you
Tomorrow morning the villagers will gaze dumbfounded at a pair of bodies hanging
Haraprasad it is you
no this is my ghost
i am defeated
i am ruined just about living
a palm tree stuck by lightning
i protested protesting for whom
Protesting for what
now i am bankrupt
Whacked all around
i am caught firmly in a trap
but hey you deserter oh coward you had accepted a job
so why have you been reduced to this
you are about to swing in space too
the fact remains that whether you protest or run away with your tail between your legs it matters little either way
everything is topsy turvy
we are all resourceless ethereal we have been wiped out
how late in the night it is
does an answer come forth
are we going to our new home father
Just see today i am starting work
Tomorrow i will give the landlord the rent and day after we will leave
you are so late
Won't you be late for work
there is still time i have just seen a house
i will go out on the route with the bus today
where will you go
i do not know yesterday they made me take the bus around the city
i noticed water in the brake joint and i could not get the brake to work
Somehow i was able to get back who knows what sort of a bus they will give me today
See what a state your sari is in
i have have a box full of silk sarees
Today i will buy two sarees for you on my way back from work
Today is pay day
if i can return from work due to kindness of their bus
Binu what toy you desire most
a train
i will go to the new home
Mother how late in the night is it
it is quite late
Won't father come with a train
he will come
Mother how does the new home look like
have you seen it
that was when i was child
when i was a child of your age a person showed it to me
the winding river and blue blue hills up there the butterflies flutter around and sing songs
have you been there
no from the distance i saw the way leading to it
i will go to Subarnarekha
Certainly someday you will go there
Scold father for coming home late
Place the toy train near my pillow
yes my dear sleep
on the swing sways Shyam
the driver died on the spot
do not break it suddenly not so loud
what happened
the brakes were not working near the Tala Park
the little girl not even 12
she was a beautiful girl
500 people set the bus on fire
the police turned up late
could not save him
is this the driver's house
See
we are totally defeated
we are not even capable of committing suicide
Ishwar will you take me once to Calcutta
i have no money but you have lots of it
in Calcutta now there is fun
in the shops hotel and race course what horrifying fun
you will see and be stupefied
how people give themselves up with the flow
Running with the crowd is the right thing to do
Gratification of the senses is the only way to salvation
Gratification
you have led an ascetic's life
Turbulent wild enjoyment to the hilt
it is such an intoxication
in spite of total loss intoxication
will you go to that bestower's fair
yes
Let's be quits with the devil
Desirous of merit Vajasravasa gave away everything
he had a son named Nachiketa
the god of death told Nachiketa do not seek self knowledge
Ask for any other boons
the celestial dancers are out of reach even for the gods
if you want music dance etc it will all be yours
Nachiketa was a fool
Nachiketa
me
Waiter
is this Ambrosia
Sir it is Bourbon Whisky
as was said by Maitreyee
what will i do with that which does not confer immortality
Thus spoke Maitreyee
what is not ambrosia what shall i do with it
Sir i will call the head waiter that is French wine
Pour it
in the absence of honey
i will have mollasses there is a dictum ingrained in the scripture
Pour it
not in listening but it is in the memory
Listening is the Upanishad pleasure in renunciation
the self cannot be realized by the weak
the maximum is pleasure
there is not pleasure in a little that is what you are'Shetaketu'
Take the gentleman home
Home
Arise awake and behold
the boons are due to you
the way is a like a sharp razor's edge
that is what the sages tell us
they did not see the Atom Bomb
they did not
never haven't seen war havn't seen famine
Haven't seen the riots haven't seen the country split up
Unreason is the hymn for worshipping the Sun
what is after that
Immerse it
after killing seven soldiers Haraprasad died
O peace O peace
Remember my deeds
Like to listen to singing
who
Good
the money sir
the daughter of a gentleman
she is never done this
this is the first time
Sir when you will see her you will be charmed
Sita he came from a village lots of money
i will take Binu to my house
Kajal
do not fret the first time is always like this
Kajal
he is come to listen to your singing
he will listen and he will go
do not fear you will get used to it
Binu's 3 months school fees
Your household expenses
Keep this 50 rupees
Make the gentleman happy and he will give lots more
i won't take anything from that you helpless one
i will take you to that room
Please wait
in that room
i will take you to that room
Getting ready please wait
Extreme penury
a gentleman's daughter is forced to do this
Ha Ram
this night too has an end
Days pass into months months into years
the plane was late
the smugglers were apprehended
yes with 2 lacs worth of gold
Come listen
the boss talking about Ishwar Chakraborty's case
the one about a woman's murder in a colony
that was not murder it was suicide
the case dragged on for 2 years before it was proved a suicide only yesterday
the boss was saying
after working all night i am least bothered
the company is setting up a new rotary machine the Company has an expansion scheme also
he said that you have been handling the case from the beginning
you know nearly all of them
and the child Binu the dead lady's son you know him
if you please the boss now then you have prospects for the future
Brother i report legal matters
i am fed up of writing about red lights and snatching
are you daggling the Magsasay award before my eyes
Ishwar has been asserting that he is guilty and he has never lied in his life
i am feeling sleepy
if the boss hears that for mere sleepiness
it is a dog's life
i am going to get a statement
it seems i have seen you somewhere
no i do not to seem to recognize you
Hey master Binu when did you arrive
i have brought him to his uncle
are you related to Mr Ishwar
no
i am a friend
i have heard that Ishwar never lied in his life
but in this case all along he has been saying
he is guilty
yes
Listen in a previous era Kshudiram became a martyr with peaceful steps with a chant on his lips with his own hands he'd put the noose around his neck
he knew what he was that was his strength
Today we the group of Kshudiram's we do not know what we are
therefore we think that fighting means getting beaten up
and being a martyr means dying like roadside dog
Call for immersion
Ishwar has realized this that is why says he is guilty
O mother open the doors
will you do me a favour please
yes
i do not wish to face Ishwar any more
after a great catastrophe
I'd rather not burden him any more
if you please
Ok i will take Binu to his uncle
not an uncle in this world he is the sole relative he has
Binu your uncle will take you to your new home
the one you used to hear from mother
Good day you are going back to homeland
it is said that you are a truthful person
you have come here to have some fun
it is true
i haven't lied
you won't go unscathed even you are guilty
me
you too are guilty
you me all of us
you think that it is only my sister who has suffered
do not you have sisters
Mother
Good day your nephew
Mr Mukherjee has sent this letter
Sir after such fiasco
Mr Rambilas is not keeping you any longer
you are very truthful and have held yourself guilty
Consequently i have become the manager
you and your sister's things are in the company's bungalow
Please remove them from the land and vacate the house
that house is now mine
Yours faithfully Jogen Mukherjee

Sorry sir

Let's go and spend more
we are decent so we will demand only 10
be conscious have a conscious
Please go
in choi
you are here
i thought you dropped dead in the toilet
you are alive
so you are going abroad for further study
you are mean uncovering my background
you were a fighter before you served in the army
you are a coward now
it was a absolute deception
there are three kinds of political apathy
Elusive apathy non political apathy and anti political apathy
to which do you belong
so you want to define our relationship
all right
i hate standardization or the logic that
Justice and courage are the monopoly of participants
the intellect with no action is a coward
is not ideology a deformation of antagonism between the two Great Powers
i envy your courage
but you should recognize the existence of others
Sure
i want to maintain our relationship
but we are not in a humdrum age remember
Let's go underground
Cheers to chaos
they look at literature as a piece of rotten fish
they are merely larvae of the warble fly
they are sweating to push their heads into the literary world
Clarify the reason why you wrote this
are you trying to make zombies out of us
You'd better have a good excuse if you do not want to die
all right i have written it
i am sick and tired of you
i can not write anything but on democracy and justice
here is my definition of you
you are a snob acting like a truth seeker
you are a capricious coward attacking others
Get out
you are disgusting
Let me say a word before i leave
Close the closet bastard
do not force anything on anyone who wants to debate
everyone has his own pain
Shut up chap
Get up son of bitch coward
Stop it
Shame on you so called literature
Stop it
Save your strength for a bigger fight
you have violated Article 3

Miss Yoon
i know you have got a drug
i thought of killing myself too

Even i go on living
Let me confess
i lied to you
my lover was not a poet
he deceived me
Please promise me that you won't take your own life
i promise
Good
Please come to the church after you succeed
i am leaving now
Good luck Young hoon
i was all mixed up
i did not know where i was headed
Sentimentalism blind daring
i accused myself for such senses
Hey that is not the road
Come here
Hey
Hey
be careful
We'd better stay here tonight
Why are you here on the mountain
and why are you going to the sea
how old do you think i am
Forty five or six
you are making me ten years older prison made me
then
i am about to kill someone
i had two friends just like you
one of them became a pastor
the other dreamed of revolution with me
we dreamed of some grandeur revolution at that time
we were the prime movers of a certain incident
then someone betrayed us
Later i learned it was one of my friend
we spent dreadful years in prison
one of us made a knife
a vengeful knife
this is it
we vowed for revenge with this
one of us was released with the knife five years later
he had a family and he finally gave up
the second and the third also gave up
Finally the knife was passed to me
it is been a long time
is he in Daejin
yes
but it is odd
Feel like i am going to the wrong way wasting my time
and i keep meeting you instead
Put these small soap pieces in your shoes
it is daybreak
do not follow me closely
Hope you will not go back to prison
Find the substance of your nihility
Young hoon
yes i am Young hoon
do you still love Rachmaninoff
so you are majoring in Korean literature
you once timidly said you'd become a writer
it was your influence
i memorized all the phrases you read me all
we shared literature and music now it is alcohol
i love to drink once in a while
are not you seeing him again
i wish i could enjoy
Rachmaninoff with you again
i am thinking of giving up literature
i am so confused
my attitude the meaning of literature
it is a chaos
the campus is a scorched ground
everyone around me rose with banners
my friends chose death
i have lost my ideals
i can not keep reading and writing
all hope is gone
yes things are losing their meanings
it is despair
but despair could be replaced by fervor
and fervor could mean a fresh start
i want to confess
i saw you in that peach orchard then
it is so clear
Peach blossoms all over and
i really do not know what is what
Let's go back
it is time to end the play
Existence doesn't exist without continuation
a glass of wine should be emptied
Despair is the real start of existence
have you found the substance of nihility and despair
have you finished your revenge
Well
what have you done
i have given up obsession
my friend his wife and children were paupers
he asked me to take his life
you would not kill him anyway
what have you given up
my sentiment which was plagued before ripening
what are you going to do
Settle somewhere perhaps
what about you
i will go back to school
Things will continue
i must go back
Good luck
Take careDear God
Senja 1877
Good lord
who is it
who knows
Well with
she seems dead
but i did hear breathing back in the hills
Hot milk tar and schnapps
and bring Sloan's medicine
what is going on
it seems there is not much to do
no it is pointless
the little girl is dead
her soul has left her
Almost left her
i said almost left her
Come again now
Dear god
Shake life back lo her
you can do that dear Father
Come back
Dear God
Come back
Make her live again and we will and we will we will build you a house of God
i swear we will do it
who are you
Get out
Leave now
do not stand there like fools
the child needs total rest
her heart Olai it is ticking like a drop of water in the springtime
now she is away again
i am Julius Kristoffersen
i am a sailor
i have sailed the distants seas
Between here and Ceylon
Please respond
Say something in English
German
are you Dutch
Maybe you are Spanish
Maybe she is deaf and dumb
but there is one language that is the same all over the world
now your turn
this is new for me
then you must be from the town
in the towns they burn coals
or you could be from a place with a lot of forest
i believe you are an orphan since we have heard nothing
if you had a mother what kind of person would she be hiding like that
Julius' shack is burning
Stop that nonsense
my apologies
Come bring the buckets
no just let it burn
it was the boy
he was playing with the coffee fire
you can cover your ass with fender when you get back
it got a bit hotter here huh
it trickels like the earth's river
Hold this bandage here
Nice blood
but too much
Nobel blood
Very nobel blood
Sweet as pure burgundywine
to be honest i think she is french
she tastes like a finer race
this girl that we call the foundling
has made fools of us for more than the last three months
by pretending that she do not recall anything from her past
now we want to know who she really is
now it is over with getting attention on that account
from now on for Gods sake we will be dancing to another tune
yes Gabriel
what is it
in that case the teacher will have to dance with me first
i am not a good dancer but i think i will join his part
Gabriel Arthur
Get out
and stay out until i call for you
you will have to learn to have respect for adults
and for an intelligence that is higher than yours
Open your psalmbooks and sing psalm 206
Love of God
does she know what that is
she who is so good at acting and lying
Maybe she can also play an instrument like that
what is it
Fresh berries
how much do you want for them
i was thinking 30 shilling if that is not too much to ask
Let me have the whole can
we let the girl put her arm into to try those at the bottom
it has been a long time since he was so domesticated that he would eat from the hand
it is worth it when you at my age gets to be feeded by the hand of a virgin
Let's see
this one is for you for the service
17 18 19
everything sold in half an hour
Put your shawl at the shoulders
and also the hair
next
can you give me some credit
next
Ohh god it is him Borr
Borr from Bekmrten
Let me have three packs of the best Brazillian coffee
for two Mark of butter and for half a Mark french bonbons of the highest quality
and make it quick
my ship is ready and my crew is waiting
Did our little charmer hear what i said
then hurry up
that is Borr from Bekmrten
Well
how much do i owe the gentleman
2 Daler and 80 Shilling
Keep the change
Spend it on moustache wax
here kids
he is here now Borr from Bekmrten
Let's go and have a look
who are these two night birds
who sneak up upon a nobel sailors shelter carrying weapons
who are you
you two who with rusty swords threatens the sleeping heart of a kings son
Demons
Demons of the night
oh child
oh woe
we just wanted to talk
you thought you were cleaver
but Borr has seen greater thiefs
he blocked the sword of the pirat Ming Fu with his pearl white teeth
you promise to sit still if i let go off you
the first who run will get the foot chopped off
you gave us candy in Holmenvr
there is no gratitude in the world
Maybe you did not like the bonbons since you wanted to shed my blood
i never tasted any better
but Borr is not the only one
These precious artifacts come from the kingdom of Gobla Grona
they give health and a long life
i was given this treasure after saving the prince's horse Matarmullah
when it was dying from horse scab
but that was back then
These bonbons are never to be devoured
without first speeking out a ritual
Repeat after me
do you have any food where you live
yes sure
it is the old wound in my stomach
i need Zatana cream
Cream and is the best
Well i can try
yes please
Food
i found this
Wow really
but it fell into sea
it is a little better now
what is your name girl
who are your parents
i do not know
are you the one they call Bremor who was found last year
the girl from the sea
Wow i never would have thought i would ever meet someone like you
In'64 i worked as a chef at this baron baronelli in Liguria
that was a sinful life
there they called me
Borra de Morcabeccio
and the Germans called me Dunkelbohrer
i had many names back then
now i am here at rberg waiting for better wind
Olai said you were free as the eagle
Sounds like he is very smart that Olai
Bremor please come
now close your eyes and spin around seven times
every turn you say'madre' and let go if you fall
and the direction you fall points out the direction where your real mother lives
Look at this
do not be afraid
i will catch you
can you remember anything else
no a little
i remember about the organ
a fire
and a man with a green scarf
and a blizzard
do not be afraid if i leave
Maybe i just go hide in the mountains
there are no boats in the fiord
where are you going
Bless you child
do not ever give up
Ever
i will ask for your fathers whereever i go
you will hear from me
be strong
where will you go
it is just me
are you stupid
i told them back home that i was going with you
and they said yes
Thet did not say anything
no because you probably asked them while they were sleeping
Why do you want to go with me
a madman
i like you
what if you end up at Iceland
i stay
i travel like an otter and lives like the wolf
i can not be responsible for you
but when the summer is over
God damn thief scum
Holy hell
it is Karl and the vassal
Bloody thief
you will regret your doings
now we got him
Devils
Heathen
can you do the' our Father'
Damn yokels
Bastards
Grab the boat
Stop
in the name of the king and the law
Shoud i stop for you fat guy
Kiss my ass
you swindler
you know i never touched the money
you devil
you will get what you deserve
Give me the knife Maria
the knife
you fucking bitch
you saved my life
you are my daughter
you are my warrior princess
my great crew
Westwards Maria
Westwards
Fuck it
our lord made us a shelter here
what is that
a photography
is this also Anna Christina
she has been waiting and waiting and waiting
are you gonna merry her
she is too good for me
but maybe this winter
first i have to get you home
how can we get food tomorrow
Borr cites a poem of some sort about taking it easy and not to worry
who is it
what is the matter
are you crying
i will die soon
by autumn you will know everything about yourself
but i won't live to see autumn
are you sick
you want to puke
Your chest
you have headaches again
no
i am wounded inside
a wound
i am bleeding
for god's sake child
where are you bleeding
but you are supposed to
they just never told you
it happens to all girls when they are about to become adult
now you are a teenager
you are having what is called your period
you get it every month
if you did not get it then there would be something wrong
it is a sign saying that someday you can have children yourself
you should be joyful
you had your first period
are you telling the truth
if i am speaking the truth
by god yes
they just forgot to tell you
a heavenly gift
Sing and play my cherubs
be happy and dance woman
Play play all people in this land
Play the 20 golden harpes
Sing every choir from Johannesburg to Finnkongkeila
and redwine
Redwine
Pour redwine over our heads
Halleluja
a woman is born
i know about a place
my sweetheart
the woman of my dreams
here i am kneeling before your lovely feet again
Tell your slave to stand up
Borr get up
you do not come around much
i am on the run again
this time not alone
what have little Borr now got himself into
the clergymans are in Troms
so here you can rest safe as a child at it is mothers breast
Beloved Brynhilde you are one hell of a tasty dish
Pardon me
is there any news on that terrible thug they call Beksorten
Bekmrten you mean
Well nothing else than he should be around here
it is said that he should have a strong attractive force on women
Ohh now i better ask Miss Brun
to bring in the coffee and the liqueur
Alvhilde
i am here
Good evening Alvhilde Brun
may i come in
Well the clergymen are in Troms so
it was you i wanted to talk to
with me
yes can i sit
Please
Thanks
the maid is elegant tonight
Thank you
Well well if it is not the vassal
i am so pleased to meet you
my dear friend dean Bloch has often talked about you
and your name
Franzn
Dean Franzn
my wife and i just arrived from Ranen
Dear housekeeper how about offering our guest coffee and cake
and maybe some liqueur
how are things going in this fiord
is there a lot of crime
there are not many crimes committed
we are dealing with this Oscar Oscarson
they call him Bekmrten around here
Supposedly he is around these fair shores now
Thanks
Miss Brun seems troubled tonight
Well i have read so much about this devilish scourge
Well scourge or no scourge
Bekmrten is probably not so bad as the authorities make him
but as a protector of the law it is my duty to investigate
when people are on false ground being disgraced by others
does he understand that
my name is Oscar Oscarson
it would be wise if the'dean' and his company could hurry up and leave here
it would be the safest
many are on the hunt for this Bekmrten
i won't dismiss that there is a chance that there will be sent posses out
yes then i will thank god's man in Ranen
for the treat and conversation
and i hope he will forgive my sudden stroke of deafness
God night and safe journey whereever you may go
you scared me
who are you
we were passing by and heard the tones
so beautiful
it is my fourth organ
where are the others you made
the first one is at Bjarkya
and one in Ibestad and one in Salangen
in Salangen
Come child and stretch your fingers
Sit here
you would not by any chance be him Borr
no
yeah
I'd better avoid lying in church
they call me Borr from Bekmrten
Let's get downstairs and listen to her
you will have to come with us now tramp
with you
yeah exactly
you are arrested for theft and attempted murder by drowning
Get out of God's house
you are profaning the church
you resist
yes
i refuse to be captured in God's house
you will have to wait outside on the stairs
so what can i do for you Sebulonsen
Allright you punk
Put me in iron
Borr mocks the vassal's mother in this song
the boat
we found this'pearl of the sea' near Sandksen
Borr
Let me in devils
Let me in
Stay out of it girl
you hear me
do not get near
you stay here until we come for you
Tomorrow there will be the interrogation
Let me out
you can piss in the pot
Devils
Jeppe will stand guard
i have to confess something
Shut up
no i guess money is of no interest for you
where have you taken the girl to
that is none of your business you filthy child kidnapper
what was it you had to confess
yeah what was it
i have become so forgetful
Borr
Borr
can you hear me
yeah yeah
Keep singing
i will get you out
Just sing
yeah
Jeppe do not you know this one
Sing with me
Shut up
Soon you will be singing in hell

you look so macho
what are you messing around with in there
Come in and have a look
Damn
Come on

Borr

Jump

Oscar Oscarson good evening
Get back here
they are getting away
Row
Row all you can
Damn you Borr
you meathead
Help me up
we made it
Stay still while i work it
Keep going
Well i will be damned
but you are a tiger
you are even worse than me
they will never catch us
Let's set course for the land of joy
and where is that
Anywhere outside this district
Sleep Maria
on a journey like this a fresh mind and strong muscles are needed
so terrible how they fight
the women too
it is the French revolution
Took place in Paris
they weren't lazy asses
they claimed the power from the bourgeoisie
i think it is time to turn of the light
Pack our stuff quickly
we have to move into the country
Chased by the vassal
is there something better in this world than being chased
we are like a couple of small mice
Among a bunch of fat cats
we are both running away and chasing at the same time
Chasing a wonderful life
the dark drowns in light
and joy can be so good
i remember more now
Just like doors slowly opening up inside my mind
Doors to the past
i did not belong with the people i was with
but here in Salangen it was
Karel was his name
he tried to kill me when i saw him set the neighbour's house on fire
i was sitting behind the wagon
but he saw me and screamed that he would kill me
i ran through the snow into the black night
i wanted to go home to my family
but then there was a blizzard and i was lost in the mountain
then everyting was black
what about Senja Norwegian island
i got a boat lift over there because the Lapps were there
i went with them so they would take me home
to my home in Finland
10 15 years ago in North Finland the corn was damaged by frost several seasons
People starved
Diseases reigned
Parents sent away their children to North Norway to survive
but the Lapps were doing better
they had reindeers
Lecher
Piss on you
Rose of Salangen
be quiet
who is it
a hunted man a wanderer in God's wineyard
a lifelover and some more
Silence
i am vassal Sebulonsen from Dyry og Trany district
i am after a criminal who is a thief and an assailant
a hardened drifter
he is called Borr from Beksmrten
Along with him is a little girl that he kidnapped
we need food for our hide in the mountains
anyone who helps this obscene criminal to escape
is guilty of breaking the law and will be punished the hardest way
a terrible punishment
Men of Salangen stop this man
he is a childmolester
Stop him women
do not open your doors for him
Play
Listen to him Sebulonsen
Lock your doors
Stop
Stop in the name of the law
Stop
Stop
in the name of the king and the law
a posse is after those two right now
a new posse starts tomorrow at 05 00
every law abiding man of good health have to meet up in six hours
as officer and vassal i have been commanded to lead the hunt
and the imprisonment of this dangerous intruder
he pulls men into the ocean
any order from me is an order from the prefects chief administrative officer
Dear lord
he is here
do not block the door
Ohh this world is full of women
Thank you sisters thank you brothers
the Lord will award you
Long live the bride and the bridegroom
Long live the life
i will get you you pitch black bastard
Tonight we will be safe
how far to the border
through the entire Mlselvdal and then a little more
but the Israelites wandered for 30 years
now they are chasing us with soldiers
we must be quite famous
now we got them
Shoot
Gilio
it is just the arm
Climb over
you can make it
Just leave me here
Shut up
we need music
over there they just play Kantele music
Christ it has reached your chest
they are coming
but they will never catch us
Borr put me down
they can not penalize me
when they have run by i will play to distract them
that way you get a head start
we hide you
Run
Fast
i will play to make them stand still
Hurry up
by the name of God
Go back

and i look like her
Perhaps she is even as pretty as i
Lily do you think you can keep him stuck with you

he has been following me all the time since we first met in the mausoleum
i can not think of any way to get rid of him

Your hair is in a mess
Let me comb it out for you
Hon Tong we should not have done this
his Majesty would never let us live together
we will never get away with this
do you still remember the last time you combed my hair
Ah
Did i
you have forgotten everything
this pair of shoes belongs to you
Really they are mine
how come everything has changed so much after i woke up
i really do not understand what has happened to me
oh
i have got to go out for a while
i will explain everything to you later
now just be patient
Sit here and wait for me
Hon Tong
Just sit here
i will come back and dress you up properly
i will be back soon
Hon Tong do not leave me alone
i will be right back do not worry
Crazy man
what a delicate pair of shoes
they are made of silk
we could not afford to buy any shoes
and this is my first pair
i treasure them too much to wear them
she has forgotten everything
is that right
Terrific
Thank you
the Armour piece and the hair you got from him
we have conducted the Carbon 14 test on them
it is proven that the armour is an antique of almost 3000 years
Also the cells of the hair are of the same age as the armour
this is really strange
that means the man must be at least 3000 years old
then this man is really a living treasure
if we send him to the Northwest Laboratory to dissect him or cremate him we can probably find out the secrets of longevity from him
but i have to see this man first
and you will have the money after this man has arrived in the Northwest safely
is that fine with you
is that fine with you
Mr Bai a lady has come to see you
Excuse me
Please
Mister is that alright
Mister
that is a menu
you can order something to eat
for me to eat
i don't' feel like eating
Waiter we will have three and that is all
Cheers
Cheers
Mr Mong when did your Majesty the first emperor die of sickness
i am the living example of the success of the elixir
his Majesty must have taken it so how could his Majesty die
Exactly
i do not think i am the only one who survived
so i have got to hurry back to his Majesty's mausoleum to find them
Fine
i will arrange everything for you
Mr Mong
can you tell us something about the building of the mausoleum
i will tell you more about modern life
Mr Bai your phone call
Excuse me

Alright

but how come we are leaving
where the hell are we going
i have to go and talk to him
i have to go and talk to him
Come on
Come on you two
Hurry up
Go ahead
we are coming
Mr Mong do not fret
this is the iron horse we call it a train
it is a lot faster than your horses
it can take you back to your mausoleum in a day's time
Let's go
Mr Bai i am deeply indebted to you for helping me back to the mausoleum
Thank you very much
it is my pleasure
our future super star would you please take care of our guest for me
i promise you will be the lead of my next film
Did women in the ancient times eat and wear high heels
and what did they usually talk about when they were in love
you have a good harvest this time as i get you this priceless living treasure
Mr Bai i know you still have something hidden from me
such as the location of the mausoleum
we still do not have any ideas where that is
we will work harder on that
Trust me we are good partners
Alright
Bai YunFei your underlings have betrayed you
huh
the cat is out of the bag
huh
the cat is out of the bag
Let's go to the mausoleum
how incredible it is that i have slept for 3000 years
Thank you
Director
Bai YunFei explain all this to me
you have forgotten everything yet i still remember it perfectly
Maybe this is a punishment from heaven
do not be upset
i promise i will be serious from now on
i will listen to every word of your recollection
do not be cross
Tell me from the beginning
Why
Why do you have to do this to me
you have never trusted me
i am not your Hon Tong
Why should i trust you
where are you taking me to
the Mausoleum is in the west but the train is heading for the east
Let me go
Let me go
Tell me
where
i do not know
it is Bai YunFei's idea
you betrayed me
Why
Ahh
Open the door
Wait for me
how much the Great Wall has changed
everything is over now
and you are not my Hon Tong
there is nothing left for me here
Take care
where are you going
i am going back to the mausoleum
that is where i belong
i am nobody in the film industry
everyone looks down on me
you are the only one who cares for me
i do not care whether i am your Hon Tong
i only want to be with you always
Hon Tong Hon Tong
Boss there you are
Take as much as you can
everything here is priceless so be careful
it is a dead end
Dead end

Get out of this place
Get out
Hon Tong
Fire
Boss do not go

the oxygen is running out
you must know the way out
i do not know
i only know it is my duty to guard his Majesty's mausoleum forever
i could not die here
i won't die
you people care so much about death
what can you do even if you have eternal life
Look at our empire
it was so glorious in my time
so what
it just turned to ashes
Tian Fong a life is still a life
if there is a way out why should we have to die
what does everyone want with an eternal life
Take me as an example
i can live forever yet i did not know what was going on outside
that is the real horror
Bai YunFei you are responsible for all this trouble
do you think i want to die
you killed and robbed the mausoleum
this is an unpardonable crime
i do not care
These days we cannot rely on anybody else but ourselves
if you want to do something great money has to come first
without money you are just a crock of shit
Understand
do not you understand
the both of you have the same ambition
no Tian Fong not for me
i just want to live
to live with you
i do not want to die
i want to be out of here with you
Tian Fong
Tian Fong
Tian Fong

i am rich
i am rich
i am rich
i am rich
i am rich
i am the first man who has ever entered the Royal Chamber in history
Your Majesty
Mong Tian Fong all these treasures belong to me
Once you trespass in the Imperial Mausoleum you cannot get out of here
what the hell is it
an earthquake

Attorney still seeking Egbert Norton heir to fortune
the will of the late Jasper'Rags' Norton aged recluse who was found dead in his shack at the city dump last year is to be probated next Thursday
the will bequeaths his entire fortune of 250 000 to his missing nephew Egbert Norton but provides that in case he is not located the entire estate goes to the city for the erection of a new zoo
anyone knowing of his whereabouts is urgently requested to contact Attorney Malcolm Kilgore executor of the estate
can you imagine using my 250 G's to cage up a lot of moth eaten animals
Your 250 G's
Dr Lake i happen to be Egbert Norton
no
how do you like that for a handle
Egbert
never mind the cracks Dixie
Why it is a veritable bonanza
oh
but you you are as hot as a volcano
that is the idea of the wooden overcoat
a pushover
Remember that sanitarium near Dayton
i do
the place is still there broken down and deserted and you are going to open it up again
that my boy would be extremely hazardous
not for a few days it won't
we are gonna work fast
you and Dixie will take the 3 00 plane out
Frankie and me will go on the next one
yeah
what about Darby
he is going on the train in the box

Attention all police officers highway patrols and county sheriffs

DANTE the Magician TEMPLE THEATRE DAYTON OHlO

Check him through
Goodbye

Better step on it
from ATLANTA to DAYTON
we will get him there
do not worry about that
Aboard
a tidy little nest egg
how about some dinner
i am getting hungry
do not be so greedy
we just split a hamburger
and besides we can eat in Dayton for half of what it costs in the diner
i will be twice as hungry in the morning
do not bicker
by the way Phillips have we enough money for expenses in Medford
by Jove it slipped my mind
how much you think we will need Parker
i should say 100 will suffice
i hope you have the necessary dollar bill
Fortunately i just have one
Thank you
Did you see that
he put a dollar bill in there and a 10 bill came out
Pardon me gentlemen but is not that counterfeiting
oh no no
you look like a man familiar with good United States currency
Up to a certain point
Amazing
Silk threads and all
Hm
it is genuine Stanley
it certainly is
Mm mm mm
Thank you
a 100 bill
you think 100 will be enough
we will manage all right
Just what is all this about sir
is it possible that men of your apparent intelligence have not heard of the Inflato
you see we have been out of town haven't we Ollie
Inflato
yes the name of this little device
Inflato taken from the word inflation
it is a spread the wealth project sponsored by the O C C
what is an Ock
Ock
O C C Office of Currency Circulation
where could we get one of those
We'd only make enough for our bare necessities
and a swimming pool
yeah
i am afraid the O C C had issued the Inflato quota for the year
TRAlN WHlSTLE BLOWS
we are getting into Medford
Phillips i have always subscribed to the idea that the American public is 99 percent honest
as i have my Inflato in my trunk i think we can let these gentlemen have this
they look honest
i will never use another slug in an Automat
Cross my heart
there you are
Thank you
Thank you
in case we haven't enough money to carry us in Medford would you give us the cash you have
oh sure gladly
there you are sir
You'd better leave us a dollar to start production
of course
Thank you
two princes
a pair of kings
a couple of jerks
what a stroke of good fortune
it sure is
Let's try it and see what a 1000 bill looks like
Think of what we can do for our country you and i
and Inflatto
Inflato stupid
we can take the whole world out of bankruptcy
and our watches out of hock
there will be no more poverty
it will stop all crime
you know what
we can put every cop on a pension
Except those two that pinched us you remember
i would not
i will grind out millions billions for our people night in night out day in day out
as long as this good right arm has the strength to carry on
there is no further need for thrift Stanley
i know but it might rain tomorrow
Aah
Enjoying your dinner gentlemen
yes indeed
how much is the check
now let me see
two number 7's and two number 8's
with a couple of New York steaks and a couple cigars
which comes to 6 80 even
Very very reasonable
it certainly is
there you are my good man
Give me a dollar and keep the rest
PHONEY MAZUMA YOU CAN'T PASS ME
yes sir this sure is a good trick
but y'all can not pass stage money on me
Stage money
Something's happened to Inflato
Ordinarily this produces millions
while you wait
now if you gentlemen is serious i got to go and report this
Give it another whirl Ollie
Let me try it
Wait a minute maybe i
Let me try see if i can not get this thing
Maybe i can get it from this side
what kind of a phony are you guys trying to pull here anyway
Something's gone wrong with Inflato
yeah it is got him by the throat
Aah
Very funny
now just cough up 6 80
this thing's supposed to print money with silk worms and everything is not it
i have heard some dillies in my years on this road but this one wins the marbles
you guys dig up the dough or off you go at the next stop
Just be patient
i will get the money
what are you trying to do
Insult my intellect
Tell Vince to stop at Milledgeville
Blackguard
and his name fits him too
we better go and find those two
before we get to Milledgeville

have you got an Inflato
i used to have one
what was that you call it
Inflato taken from the word inflation
Money just poured out when the gentleman sold it
yeah it was a good buy for 50 before it went haywire
you mean to say you paid 50 for this
no 49
we have got a dollar tied up in the gears
i haven't seen one of these for ages

Give me those
that is
all right you guys stop bothering Mr Dante here
we are getting into Milledgeville and that is where you get off
we will pay you when we get Charlie to Dayton
Sure
Why are you putting them off
they tried to beat a dinner bill for 6 80
we did not
i assure you that our intentions were perfectly honorable
i will pay their bill
it is up to you but for my dough you are just encouraging a couple of con men
i will take that chance
that is where you get off
Sorry boys but you can buy these at any novelty shop for 1 50
you mean we have been victimized
i am afraid so
Ollie we have been cheated
how can we ever repay you
with the 50 we are gonna get for Charlie
we can give
are you stopping in Dayton
i will be playing at the Temple Theatre
then we will see you tomorrow
you have been very kind
Goodbye
Goodbye Bill
Goodbye
FERNDALE SANlTARlUM
Operator i wanna talk to attorney Malcolm Kilgore in Dayton at Riverdale 3 4786
Darby got in all right
Dixie phoned
he is on the way over now
Shh
Good
what
this is Dr Travelyan at the Ferndale Sanitarium
all right i will hold the line
MALCOLM KlLGORE ATTORNEY AT LAW
yes yes this is Kilgore
this is Dr Bradley Travelyan of the Ferndale Sanitarium
a few days ago i read an item in the paper regarding Egbert Norton
have you information regarding him
Well i have a patient here apparently the victim of a hit and run
for three weeks now he is been between life and death
this morning he spoke for the first time
Said he was Egbert Norton
Identify himself
oh i suppose he can
but won't you recognize him when you see him
Egbert Norton ran away from home when he was a boy
as a consequence i have never seen him
he should be able to identify himself by a very unusual ring given him by his uncle
that is if he still has it
i have a duplicate of the ring in my possession
Why yes he does have an unusual ring
i happened to noticed it when i dressed an abrasion on his arm
that sounds encouraging
when can he come to my office
in his condition a trip to town at this time might have serious consequences
but on the other hand a visit from you might be very helpful to the boy
Fine
we are located in Ferndale on the road to Cincinnati
huh
Say 1 00
oh that will be quite satisfactory
yes i will see you then sir
Goodbye
Well gentlemen that calls for a drink
has anyone a bottle
it is Dixie
hi fellas
you got him
he is in the box
Nice going Dixie
Steady
Come on give us a hand Doc
Easy now easy
Keep punching Darby old boy
we will have you out in a shake
Gently now

Lf he ain't we are all dead gooses
Geese
Watch out for that first step

Bring him in
Put it down

Darby
Darby

Get me a jimmy
Get out of the way

this is a mummy
an imitation one at that
you would not be pulling a fast one would you Dixie
who me
have you blown your topper
where is Darby
i do not know
Hold it Joseph my boy
i have just made a very significant discovery
These handbills belong to Dante the Magician
you mean he made Darby disappear
Inadvertently yes
Find out if Dante's playing Dayton
he is
i read he is at the Temple Theatre
my deduction is correct
this must be Dante's
by coincidence identical with ours
Let's go
Temple Theatre
Hold on
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
we must do this with the utmost care
any one of you might be recognized
since i can walk the streets with reasonable impunity i think i am the logical one to go
yeah i guess he is right
Mr Kilgore
i almost forgot

he is been right here in the theater working
you can not think Tommy would do that
i know how you feel but Mr White here hasn't told you things he should have
oh he is right Margo i should have told you a long time ago
this is Doc Lake
he used to run a sanitarium
i worked as his assistant while going through medical school
i did not know we were mixed up with a gang until they arrested us
i found out we were treating gunshot wounds without making a report
Just a victim of circumstances as usual
Officer that man was killed before he was put in the coffin
who says so
you said he was shot through the heart
that bullet entered the top of the coffin
i am doing the masterminding in this show Mr Dante
and hand over that gun you fired at the coffin
i am holding you too
Ridiculous
Stanley there is been a
Stanley

Well what happened sir
Somebody slugged me

We'd better tell Mr Dante about it
Mr Dante
Mr Dante somebody slugged this gentleman back there
what do you know about the killing
nothing
i was in the audience
i am an attorney at law
my name is Malcolm Kilgore
i am looking for a client Egbert Norton
i bet those college boys did it
they are always playing practical jokes
College boys
the ones looking for the coffin
Three of them
where did they go
i am asking the questions
what have college boys got to do with this
i do not know
they had guns
they went out the exit through the Hawaiian tepee
Wait

Right through here

Tell him Darby
this guy is Steve Barnes a federal dick
Why did not you let a guy in on it
Sorry
i had to produce an imaginary inheritance to smoke this guy out
it was all a phony
that is right
i did it all with mirrors
my apologies Mr Dante
and what happened to old Uncle Jasper
Did he really kick off
no that was a phony too
he is in Alcatraz
Good
i always liked the old stinker
he will be glad to see you too
Why did you kill Doc Lake
because he tried to double cross me
when they dumped me here i got out
when i heard somebody coming i ducked
Doc Lake comes sneaking along
he pulls out his cannon and thinking i am still in the coffin pumps a slug in it
then he starts to scram and i let him have it
i stuck him in the coffin to show him he can not make a monkey out of me

Sim Sala BimMa thinks i am always lying

not at all when ever did you lie
Grandpa i did not slap Ramesh
then why is his mother complaining
you must've done something
i just touched his cheek so lightly
no not by the look of that cheek that one was one big ugly welt
Keep your hands off Ramesh's cheeks
and you get home in time
loom out
Fix the lapel mikes
Cut the noise
i hope you are comfortable sir
Technical problems you see
Understandable
Proceed when you can
Right away sir
shall we
so Mr Tiwari from where did this chain of events originate
the stoy begins in Gorakhpur
the contention was railroad contracts
Railroad development contracts worth millions are issued here
Mafia don Tarkeswari Singh had a major say in these contracts
in the 90s the gang was challenged by a new rival Don Gajraj Singh
Ty to understand Tarkeswari he deserves to get the contracts for the job in his area
Why must you make a grab for these
Gazipur and Balia are his so who gets the railroad repair contracts
you
no now it is time we shared the spoils
are you crazy
Hear me out Tarkeswari
now you hear me out
Eveyone knows evey railroad contract is mine be it in Gorakhpur or Gazipur
and i fought long and hard for what is mine
and it is been a decade and no one has taken from me what is mine
and the ones who tried have died
you tell these upstarts to mind their limits
let's go
no please not in a huff
i am leaving
i came here only because of you Mr Dwivedi
Excuse me
now what
he will take some convincing yes he is stubborn but he will understand
Until then
Restraint
Patience does it we must not let things get out of hand
Ajay tea
Put it down
i will have it later
and biscuits
Ma you will tire yourself slogging all day like this sit with me
i am not yet done with the unpacking
it is only a day since we arrived
you want to get over eveything in a day
Twenty years has transformed this city
i have come back to a different city even the language has lost its grace
Nothing's like what it used to be
you get to bear the brunt of my frequent transfers
Fourteenth posting in eight years you are doing fine got to pay this price for your integrity dereliction of duty is easiest to get away with
so how do you find lucknow
Fine
i have had a long relationship with this city
here is where i began
in those days one hoarding even read
Smile because you are in lucknow
look you are smiling for real
what is that
a few paper cuttings of reports related to Tarkeswari Singh's murder
if these are a few what'd be more
as usual you seem to have researched it in depth already and now you are looking for a discussion are you
Secretay to chief minister on line one
yes Mr Gupta
Kapoor the principal secretay and i want a discussion about the big parade
Sure i am in a meeting now
at ten thirty
Three boys
Sixty rounds
Firing lasted some 30 seconds
they never had a chance
all rimless
Fired from carbines
Rivaly over university elections
Semi automatic in university elections
Smile because now you are in lucknow
in 1991 just after the assembly elections
lucknow was a hotbed of political turmoil
Out of the power struggle emerged a new chief minister and his lieutenants who assumed power
a sirocco blew over the political landscape and all was moving well each at its own pace
the World Trade Organisation i have heard about but about international trade i know scant little
yes Ma
can you make her out
Please let it be
Come on ty to you are a policeman
what Ajay Kumar this is Anamika Major Subodh Kant's daughter
oh you are all grown up
the major telephoned yesterday after reading your interview in the papers he is impressed with your replies and i asked him how is your little daughter
that had him in splits
and here is the little one
Keep yourselves company i will rustle up a snack
Kidney beans are still your favourite
yes always
Meeting up after so long almost twenty years
yes
so you do something
so what do you do
lecturer in economics
in lucknow university
Too economical with words for a lecturer
she has the airs
now that the one with airs is here the fragrance of jasmine will linger all night
the lovely bride
the lovely bride is as striking as lightning
her veil
what need was there to kill Akhilesh
we decided
no fratricide
do not lose your head
when we decided on that our priorities were different
then a word of honour is of no value
None
if anything's worthwhile it is only the business
for the sake of business we can do anything anything
anything
Suboo
look Gajraj it is simple bloodletting is what nobody wants
because nobody stands to lose except we and we have been in business for so long
our interests are demarcated a system has been put in place
if you look at it that way each of us is powerful
then where is the problem
that is where the problem is eveyone is powerful
no one can be reined in
this has got to be changed
a new order will come to be
Only one will reign unequalled and omnipotent
his power will be ultimate
and you assume that we will abdicate in your favour
no
to which end you must be denuded of your powers
so what do you expect from me
this Gajraj can do anything
he speaks strangely of power struggle and supremacy
he doesn't listen he has gone mad
you are new to town
so it is our duty to draw your attention in the right direction whether or not you may care to recognise us
Narain Pandey
Mafia don active in the states of Uttar Pradesh Bihar Madhya Pradesh
Accused of murder attempt to murder abductions extortion and gun running
l9 criminal cases registered
what was that about recognition
that is a twenty year old file
those allegations are false
i am committed to social causes and the world knows that
Why are you after me
i only came to tell you Gajraj's stoy
Gajraj's stoy and yours are any different
it is the system you have created mafia dons like you and Tarkeswari Singh
now Gajraj emerges out of it
and the sole contention is he wishes to run your system his way
Someone's doing to you what you did to someone else
Yesterday's boss was Narain Pandey
now Gajraj Singh then someone else
Your stories are all the same
you realise the implications
Fully well
it is private turf
the police will do nothing
so Gajraj goes scot free
no concern for social workers of your ilk
what are you searching for inside the dictionay for so long
there is this word Ma
Supremacy
Supremacy as in struggle for supremacy
the vey words he said
Said who
someone who is a social activist
what is a social activist got to do with struggle for supremacy
this one has a lot to do he is a different kind of activist
do you know the meaning of supremacy
yes it is in political science books
Supremacy as in absolute power when assumed is not to shared
it can only be seized
Absolute power is his who can cower anyone into obedience and he makes happen whatever he wishes on his terms
two things in common
Firstly these murders are connected to railroad contracts
Secondly the brutality in these assassinations
Whole magazines were pumped in where two bullets could've been enough
the message is opposition kills
Gangsters after all Iet them get killed
Good souls for doing what we can not
i beg to differ sir
Matters are not as simple as they seem
the victims included police informers
Happens all the time
then it is going wrong sir
and like you always tell me what is wrong is always wrong
at ease
how many men with Gajraj
Three men four months ago
now he has twenty one
some are already in police records
some are outsourced from other gangs mostly university students
Same old stoy university students
i wonder at times how these criminals can brainwash even an educated mind
after all this hullabaloo over education this is what has become of you
i have tried
but no one ever gave a chance to do anything
Ever wondered why you weren't given even a chance
because you are powerless
look up
who will give you a break if you are powerless
there are no chances for the helpless their chances are stolen from them
you see this man
and the one standing over there
None of them ever got a chance so what is the big deal
it is what has been happening all along and it will go on happening forever not a chance is given
but one thing still sets you apart from them
Unlike you they decided not to remain helpless and not to take insults
if need be they will answer taunts with bullets
but that was their decision
now question is what do you wish
i told you a month ago kill him
he is dangerous
but who cares to listen to me
Calm down i have spoken to Kanpur
in a day or two it will be arranged
if you only gave me one signal i would've shot the bastard
in Narain's death the last pillar of the old order has crumbled
the new overlords added an edge to the old order unleashing a headline hitting saga of abductions ransom contract murders
Terror ran rife in the world of crime the game was getting dangerous by far
Infamous railway contractor and ex legislator Vijendra Singh shot to death in broad daylight inside his residence
on record are comments by Mr Mishra ex minister for law and order
if mere enactment of legislation could achieve the intent of the law the county would not have come to this
it takes an understanding of ground realities and necessities and the earlier we realise it the better
Mr Dwivedi do arrange for a meeting with this Gajraj
you do not want to mess with him Mr Mishra
he is a cynic never speaks his mind and ends up doing these bizarre acts
then he is the man of the hour
what
he will prove to be vey effective in the political fracas that is shaping up
but Mr Mishra
Dwivedi not all battles can be fought within the confines of the political perimeter
Strange solutions are sometimes sought
Mr Ajay here is the volume you wanted
Contemporay Issues in Organised Crime
it was tough finding this one
hello how are you
hello and how are you
Fine
looking for a book
no my students wanted help just being of assistance
Coffee do you drink coffee
yes
so
can you join me for a coffee would you like to
yes but my students
one too many
my policemen too
you are not visiting us
Ma often speaks of you
Your coffee
the heart is mute
so pour out
your feelings
Bring it to your lips
Sunset or SUnriSe
you are in my heart evey moment my love
do not shy away
do not sneak away
the heart is mute
Pour out your feelings
Silence says
things are going too far my love
my thoughts you rule
you invade my dreams
in my hair i find you
in my arms i find you
in nights of loneliness
i find you
you are the air i breathe
my heart beats for you
the heart is mute
Pour out your feelings
do not shy away
do not sneak away
the heart is mute
Pour out your feelings
Fresh development
Case of carjacking at gunpoint on the expressway by Gajraj and his men
how many men
Five including Gajraj
the driver resisted shot with an AK 4l
Bullet in the leg
anything serious
no sir routine
Gajraj is in Benares
that is his address
Confirmed news
Pukka information sir
the house belongs to a convicted felon he also happens to be Gajraj's uncle
and he is a swine
i wish I'd shoot him
they used this house last month when the ex legislator was killed
do we know the topography of this area
yes sir some basic information
so what is on your minds
I'd rather that we stuck to the proper procedure
what is the procedure
we take the local police into confidence and we plan a joint operation
like the time when we went to town with our operation
in fact sir tv crews were at the railroad station for the lucknow Police
Even gave us
live coverage
so we ignore a well laid out system in total disregard for right procedure
do not expect results out of procedure
Solanki
Yadav is right
the local police must be involved
but sir
but we have no such information
we have our sources
Wonderful
Your sources inside my jurisdiction
Well you see Mr Ajay we are in the midst of a high security deployment in Benares
so there is a dearth of police personnel
but your mission is as important
Assistant Superintendent Tripathi will join you
i am sure you have adequate forces
but tell me is Gajraj Singh a criminal of such import that it warrants the presence of a Senior Superintendent of Police
yes it warrants
and some habit
then change your habit
Officers like you give us a hard time
Dwivedi was here
you were asleep
he wants you in lucknow
Why for what
Wants to set up a meeting
with this one
Ramnath Mishra
he said it is urgent something important
Want to meet
but tell him the meeting is not happening in lucknow
over here
in Benares
you think he will come here
if it is necessay for him he will come anywhere
the string of failed encounters continued for weeks
Operations were mounted in Gonda Azamgarh and Allahabad
there were also stray incidents of success
but the efforts of the police had little restraining effect on the activities of the mafia in Eastern Uttar Pradesh
the powers that be in the government castigated the spirited efforts of the lucknow Police
Why is the police failing to match expectations
Failure or successes of operations cannot be the basis of analysing police initiative
Honestly we are tying our best
are such initiatives being marred by the police politician mafia nexus
that was Ajay Kumar Special Superintendent of Police on the crackdown on criminals
Dateline October 14 199l
Seven unidentified persons wearing police uniform forced their way into the residence of legislator Mr Jagatwedi and misbehaved with the legislator and his family members
you are requested to suspend the responsible personnel in order to prevent such infractions against honest politicians
that report says about all there was
Only missing information is that night
Gajraj Singh happened to be the legislator's guest
if we could only complete the search we would've nabbed him
the Inspector General of Police intervened
despite all its flaws this city is politically vey active
Evey aspect of life in this city is intertwined
here is a system which prescribes evey procedure
in my mind we ought to dwell upon the outcomes whatever the procedure
this special force has no juridical responsibilities no civil duties
it is an administrative legal quagmire
are you aware
Sir it is a new approach it has its advantages
if such a force is ratified what of jurisdictions of the police precincts
are they to cease to function
Officers who are beyond reproach can be committed to the sole agenda of wiping out organised crime licensed to use preferred means
we are bound by legislation
this force has no space in our system
Sir let this special force be granted state wide jurisdiction to allow freedom of movement within the state without any need for permits
the force will report directly to the Assistant Director General law and Order
that is you
Only a few provisos to existing systems can make way for this force
Provisos
the Assistant Director General says that our system is incompetent
Even the constitution is amended using provisos
that doesn't mean that the constitution is incompetent
Sir if i may so appeal for a special purpose
let us assign a special team of police officers
Mr Assistant Director General to maintain law and order you may use such personnel and procedure as are prescribed in the system
the new irrigation minister's daughter in law needs security cover
will be done as you say
but only cash won't make it work
what else
the tender for the twin track railroad between Gorakhpur and Deoria has a bidder representing me
he ought to bag the contract
what
how can anyone guarantee the contract what is this child's play
it is never happened before
if it is never happened before then it will happen now
Just because you want it
Mr Mishra make him see reason
do it the way he wants
but Mr Mishra
Gajraj you have got the overview
you will get the details tomorrow
what is the matter Ramji
a trunk lying outside the store room
i will take care of it
Keep it here
Vey well
Major Ravi Kumar is accused of deserting his post instead of confronting the enemy
Bullets were flying all around Prabha
Corpses lay strewn eveywhere
Black is the colour of dead blood i discovered
you understand Prabha
but never tell this to Ajay
you won't will you
Ma
Papa is not opening his door
will you ask Papa to open the door
this tea is so insipid it belongs to the gutters
i think he sold out to Mishra he won't let you taste anything sweet
Stop staring and go and tell the opposition that in the elections this time Mr Thakur will defeat Mishra soundly
which room is Mr Thakur's
this one
look what they are writing in the papers
i am guilty for Thakur's murder
Anarchy is the chief minister's responsibility
are we framing a reply to this or are not we
this government is reduced to a joke have you read what is in that
yes sir but these four papers are the opposition's mouth pieces
they enjoy no political standing right sir
Clearly a parochial interpretation instead of objective analysis
Right sir
may i speak now
yes sir
what is printed is not so much the question as the fact of what happened
now question is what are we doing to stop this unbridled anarchy
we are doing our best to apprehend the perpetrators
then ensure Mr Principal Secretay that the efforts are honest
i have told you eveything on phone what more do you wish to know
in the deposition you have stated that you walked out and was surrounded by four gun toting men who bundled you into their car and moved off
can you describe the place where you were held
some village most likely the rooms were mud walled
anything else you can recall
Excuse me i am ill
the doctor advises me to avoid stress
how was the ransom paid
they summoned my accountant to a parking lot in Delhi
Gajraj was there to receive it in person
Settled at
what
Settled at how much
3 l million ust 3 l million
Sir 3 l million is a lot of cash
Maybe you are right
but the police was ready
had you co operated with us we might've succeeded in arresting them
for members of my family my life being more precious they wished to see me alive not wrapped in a shroud
by 110309 am the police control room had news of the shootout at the hotel
Gajraj and co needed 5 minutes at least to clear of a 190 metre crowded sidewalk
Notably
Understood
leaving the hotel at 1103 am they reach their car at 1108
at 1105 am Gajraj telephoned the dead man's brother told him about the murder and warned him off a railroad contract
Interestingly this call originated from a cellphone
Impossible
it is not even ten days since cellular services began in lucknow
how could he have found a phone
he has one and he is making good use of it
how are we to track cellular conversations
landlines can be brought under surveillance but cellphones how
that was a poser for the man in charge of law and order who was aware that the police were unprepared for this new weapon in the hands of the underworld
Surprisingly the until the mid nineties the police across the county had failed to place cellular phones under surveillance
in this test of grappling with this new technology lucknow Police was at a loss
each cell is a magnetic area which is defined by transmission towers
Transmission towers in cities use tri directional antennae on highways it is bi directional
the base station is a transmitter
Sizes of magnetic fields depend upon transmission wattage of base stations
Mr Solanki one poser
i can not comprehend a bit
the GSM cell structure is hexagonal
Discussions after a peaceful tea break
i do not think i have the appetite sir
Get on with your tea please
Syed you got something to say
one problem sir
our requirements are vey specific
These telecom experts are engrossed with technical details
we do not need any of this
Actually we need someone who can explain cellular technology in the parlance we use
i can explain but if you wish to understand you must attend the classroom regularly
we will go over it once again
look it is shaped like interconnected little hexagons in a beehive
just the way GSM communications networks are designed enabling transit across points using an audio trigger
be back in class tomorrow
we will discuss Wil
Mr Tiwari
i am late for my next class
can we discuss this later
Possibly not
the vey next day i am probationed on research and given a spacious office at the police headquarters
one table one tape recorder two telephones three mobile phones
from the university libray i had picked up all available books and journals on cellular technology
Daylong meetings with telecom experts and night times for research
a replicated SlM of the number we want to tap what i mean is a matching SlMcard is inserted in this cellphone
we will be able to eavesdrop without affecting the subscriber's bill
and so began electronic surveillance
we placed the mobilephones of Gajraj and his men under surveillance
and we began monitoring all numbers calling to and from these numbers
it took us time and we had our share of mistakes
but gradually the police caught up with organised crime's new gadget
Four encounters in eighteen days what is come over lucknow police
not a single outsider knew that he was coming in still the police gets to know
someone must've spotted him he was one for flashy outfits
no
this encounter had to be pre planned
the police knew when and where
how come they got the information
Pay him off what is there to ask
no i am with Gajraj now
we will take time
Get him to call me
i want him at the Bata showroom in two hours
Alone
what happened
let's talk later
Careful what you talk
Vey careful
how are you keeping
i am fine Anamika no reason for wory
the body reminds one of the ageing years
one good outcome of this illness is getting to meet you
you had all but forgotten about us
i was here the day before
you were asleep
Maybe Solanki give me a break will you please
who is speaking
i am Anamika
we know you the university teacher
you tell your policeman we won't spare that bastard we will bump him off so while there is time let him choose between a transfer or a lucknow funeral
no one can save him
you understand
Anamika what happened
whose phone
nothing just a wrong number
These kinds of calls keep coming
but they are no good folks
Thus the need for men like us to fix no gooders
it is late i should be leaving
Mr Hariprasad Singh is one non resident Indian industrialist who has carved a niche for himself in the European and American markets
despite his great success he has kept his ties with his motherland intact
the government of Uttar Pradesh is therefore felicitating him for his rare contribution
before conferring this honour on him
I'd like to tell you a stoy
there is this hamlet close to lucknow
Peepiya
there lived a poor farmer in the village
one of his sons was vey good at his studies but he could not pursue his studies owing to the bad financial situation at home
there was also a landlord in the hamlet
a vey kind soul
he came forward to bear the expenses of the upbringing of the poor farmer's son
from school to college the poor farmer's son completed his studies with the landlord's only son
from childhood to adolescence the landlord's son never ever reminded the farmer's son of his humble bearings
he treated him like a brother
ladies and gentlemen that poor farmer's son is today your Chief Minister
and today at this moment he is about to felicitate the landlord's son
Kapoor it is a stroke of good fortune for this county that its affairs are not run by politicians but by bureaucrats like us
else you and i know what would have happened of the system here
never mind
i will make it
Thank you
despite his goodness the Chief Minister is today in a weak position
the ruling party and its alliances have only 218 members in a legislative assembly of 405 members
it is indeed a weak position
Milk
yes
i have received an offer from Ramnath Mishra
he wants to join the ruling alliance with 29 of his members and all his criminals in the state
i do not need to tell you that an alliance with him is vey necessay for us
however he has a condition
Tea
Thank you
over tea the chief secretay spoke of the transfer of SSP Ajay Kumar
it was a small price to pay for forging a new political alliance and a necessity given the scenario of the emerging political future
the ADG of lucknow knew vey well that these orders could not be turned down
this transfer is crucial for all of us
it is okay if you have already made up your mind sir but if we have to effect the transfer of an officer like Ajay Kumar to garner the support of a politician like Ramnath Mishra
i
i just do not understand this sir
you need to be farsighted to understand this move
Foresight
Haven't you left Tiwari ji
i have gotten over some habits in the last one month
Going home is one of them
what are you doing
i have been studying Gajraj's phone details
Whenever he makes a call outside lucknow he changes the SlM card ook the equipment identification number is the same but the IMSI is altered
Good enough
he will at least get to know that his phone's being tapped
that gun if you do not mind can you put it away
any problems
the sight of such things gives me a scare
i can not concentrate properly
i have also requested Solanki and Baidyanath to keep these weapons out of sight
no problems
so long as you are comfortable
you tea's getting cold
here are some call details sir
Mr Tiwari had asked for surveillance on four telephone numbers
the third number happens to be a Public Call booth at Gomti Nagar
Dubey visits the place vey often and makes all out station calls from there
he is expected to be there at eleven again today
the second World War had just got over and the American economy was limping back to its feet when a 22 year old Indian found America to be the ideal place to
Gaju bhaiwa Dubey ji was at the Gomti Nagar PCO a little while ago
the police suddenly arrived there and without any warning they started firing
Dubey ji's got killed
he had decided to achieve what he wanted to and also overcome the hardships and obstacles he came across
i strongly believe that a man's life is a never ending struggle
what are we going to do about tomorrow
must we call it off
it is going to be vey difficult without Dubey ji anyway
no
if we call it off now the position we have made for ourselves will all be finished
in one simple stroke
let's go ahead with it
we will deal with whatever happens
do you have a message for the young generation sir
yes
Hail India
Members of the Gajraj Singh gang killed industrialist Hariprasad Singh near the botanical gardens at lucknow and abducted his 10 year old grandson
the miscreants who were driving a white coloured Cielo surrounded H P Singh and his grandson when they were out on their morning walk
According to eye witness accounts when H P Singh resisted the assailants
Gajraj Singh opened fire on him with an AK41 assault rifle killing him on the spot
H P Singh was a childhood friend of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister
Hariprasad Singh's body has been taken to his village for the last rites
i am return to Thee this black calm fire
i am also return to Thee the white ashes the flowing waters the winds and the vast open skies which is anyway mute
i know God that you knew
one day i would return it all to you
Hari Prasad loved this poem right from his childhood
he recited the poem to us whenever he could and we heard him out too
in fact it has taken me so many years to realise its true meaning today
you were you saying something
i was telling you about the jurisdiction of the Special Police Force sir
the Special Force does not have any regional responsibilities
is not that what you said
yes sir
without restrictions on jurisdictional movement it would be easier for us to move swiftly in the entire state
Excuse me
must not our focus right now be on rescuing Mr Hari Prasad's grandson
These legalities can be discussed even later
the focus even now is on saving Mr Hari Prasad's grandson
we are even discussing the legalities so that we can nab the kidnappers quickly
Saving the child and the formation of a Special Police Force
i can not see what the connection is all about
you need foresight for that Mr Gupta
if the Special Force wishes to involve district police for an operation they should be given a free hand
some incidents have the power to change political thinking
Hari Prasad's killing was one such incident
in the meeting that extended Iate into the night all aspects of the Special Force were discussed in great detail
Honest answers were sought for burning questions and an attempt was made to understand evey aspect in great depth
the resolve was there and the formation of the Special Task Force was a reality
so you are joining me in the STF
what else sir
this is the time to do something
we are all with you
with you
for you
Always
that is a slogan of the Delhi police
Whatever
it fits what say Tiwari ji
Right
with you
for you
Always sir
Well
Weren't you told not to make a noise
can not you get that into your skull
i am thirsty
i will wring your neck
End of your thirst
i am going nuts listening to you ranting in the last eight days anyway
Gajju bhaiwa has sent for you
yeah
Make another sound and i will send your head to your mother
you get that
the rat wants water
Give him some water after an hour
Sure
Brajesh
Coming
was this the only hideout you could find
Right next to the railway track
i can not even sleep in peace
the consignment from Nepal has to be received at lucknow tomorrow
Take the next train
you will meet Dwivedi's man with the money there
Make sure you phone me as soon as you get the delivey
Kasim no screwing around this time
what happened
the report has arrived sir
you have all the details
oh yes sir
our information was wrong sir
they did not go to Kanpur at all
and the man we have arrested belongs to the Balram Pandey gang
he has nothing to do with Gajraj
Tiwari ji the number four is really a public call centre
there are local numbers too
what is up Tiwari ji
Well we have confirmation from the exchange that Kasim is in lucknow
at 1020 he made a call to his girlfriend
because there was a disturbance it appeared he wanted to kiss her and since the voice still was not clear he called her again after 5 minutes
both calls were made from the public phone on platform number one
he is still there
Splash the water on his face
Go on
where is the kid
Open your eyes
Use some more water
that is okay but did you get anymore information from Kasim
no sir
we got whatever information he had to give
he has nothing more to say
and where is Chhapna
on the lucknow Benaras highway
about 25 kilometers away from aunpur
it is the region where we caught Bajrangi about a month ago
Sir do we have to really take the kidnappers alive
that is the decision you will make
and your decisions will henceforth be my decisions
Munna
Hey Munna
where are you
when are we going to have a bulb here
Find him and let me know quick
no word from Kasim
no
we have telephoned evey place
Nobody has a clue
let's wait for another hour
if we still do not receive word
let's take the kid and head towards Allahabad
must be the milkman
why are you here today
where is the boy
Gajju bhaiwa Ramlal here
i saw a white Sumo heading towards Chhapna early this morning
i have been tying to reach you but i just could not get through
i was so worried
Hey
Step aside
Baidyanath call HQ and tell them that the kid is safe
to take him away from here
let's go
who were they
the police team from lucknow that came to Benaras on your trail four months ago
you did not call to warn us this time
when we ourselves did not know how could we tell you Chaudhay ji
Think about it
Gupta ji you are the SSP
how could there possibly be an operation in your area without your knowledge
you do not understand sir
the STF covers the whole of U P
and the local police' involvement in their operations is next to nothing
the other day in Bareilly in broad daylight they killed Suraj Pal Ojha in an encounter
the local police got to know when they were made witnesses to record the incident
and you tell me that i did not call you
you know sir the STF and the local police are two separate authorities
Mr SSP what more do you know about the STF
i began my studies in lucknow
in the la Martinier School
i was only eight when my father expired
we moved to Delhi after that and i completed my education there
Sir how were you at your studies
but i always knew what to study and what to avoid
i am told you got vey good marks in the Civil Services examination
you could even have become an Indian Administrative Officer
that is true but i always wanted to join the police force
how old are you sir
3 1
it is important to know ma'am
no
and i mean it okay
Tell us sir
Please
and you are laughing
i am sory
do you really manage to teach them
it is vey easy
and they really listen to you
yes
there is a way of teaching
Why did not you answer Anita's question
Anita who
the one who asked you whether you have ever fallen in love
you think i should have answered that
yes
it is necessay to answer certain questions
how are you doing Satyapal ji
i am okay
and how are you keeping
much better
it takes time for things to return to normal
what brings you here again
i had to figure out some things
i thought you'd perhaps be able to explain them in detail here
Follow me
Hari Prasad's grandson was freed from Gajraj's clutches twelve days ago
from the same location we recovered documents of two plots of land
Investigations revealed that the names and addresses in the documents were fictitious
would you like to take a look
both the plots happen to be located in a posh area of lucknow
Construction activity is also proceeding on a war footing
the name of the construction company is Mehra Constructions
we got a tip off nine days ago and your phone's been under surveillance for the last eight days
what do you do for Gajraj
and why do you do it for him
Take your own time
i am in no hury
the ransom from Satyapal Mehra was to be made in two installments
the first a cash payment of 3 l million
the second was the use of the name of Mehra Constructions as a front for Gajraj's land dealings
Even lucknow's real estate market like the railway contracts was now thriving on funds from the underworld
Taking him to court
yes sir
the lawyer has asked for documents to seek his remand
the hearing is at 3
what happened of his file Solanki
it has been delivered to the ADG
See you this evening
Sir this is Basheeruddin Ahmed
we arrested him in Azamgarh yesterday
he actually hails from Nepal
he was the source of the AK41 rifles and pistols we recovered from Gajraj's gangsters recently
this is the photograph of Mirza Aslam Shaikh
the frontman for the ISI in Nepal
he is also connected with the Bombay blasts case
Actually this is the guy Basheeruddin works for
but why would Gajraj mess around with someone like Aslam Shaikh
it is not about messing around sir
it is all about convenience
Gajraj's criminal activities are fast spreading
for which he needs weapons of evey kind
and there is only one man who can give him such sophisticated weapons today
Mirza Aslam Shaikh
how long has this been going on
5 months sir
in fact Gajraj visited Nepal only Iast month
to meet Aslam Shaikh
we got from Basheeruddin a VHS of the meeting
Stop Baidyanath from leaving sir
now
it must all have happened vey suddenly
to live
Well lord
this body is but Yours
to Thou we must surrender it
and thus Sub Inspector Baidyanath Mishra had left us
in the coming weeks the STF prepared a list of underworld ganglords and other most wanted criminals
what followed was a spate of arrests encounters raids and killings
for perhaps the first time in the histoy of Uttar Pradesh's police organised crime was being challenged in an organised manner
the underworld was badly jolted by the offensives mounted by the STF
the land deal in the city has been put on hold
Things are hot at the moment
i have even told the boys that until things cool down
Tea for you Gajju bhaiwa
did not i ask you to take rest
you are running a fever
why are you still working when you are not well
Chaudhay have you sent for a doctor
yes i have
he will be here by this afternoon
Well go to sleep now
Go
the STF guys bumped off lallan Shukla yesterday
they are now after this guy
Poor lallan did not know much so he could not say anything
but this guy has all the information
if he squeals
Nothing's going to happen
you wory for no reason Chaudhay
the moment his health improves arrange for him to leave lucknow
i will find a way out
Ajay i must leave now
i am going with you
no
you have got to become a big man and look after your mother
you must study hard and never be afraid of anyone
it is not good to be scared
do you understand my son
Go on now
Ma
Papa's not opening the door
Ask him to open the door
do not you guys want to go
the train has arrived
C'mon
the train has arrived on time
how about the food
who the hell knows
let's go
his name is Shridhar Pandit
a graduate from the University
his father's a teacher in a primay school
he was working with Gajraj for the last ten months
it is said that it was him and not Gajraj who shot Narain at the railway crossing
how are you Ajay
and where are you
i am in the office Ma
what is wrong
i got a terribly threatening call
they said that they would crush you like a bedbug come home right now
i want to see you
i am feeling vey restless
i will come home as soon as my work is over Ma
i told you to come home right now
i do not want any arguments
and do not drive all alone
Make sure there is someone with you
do you understand
all right Ma
i am coming over
i will have to leave Solanki
there were some threatening calls and my mother's vey upset
the phone call really shook them up Bhaiwa
of course i know that
Hey kid ask for some tea
if he doesn't come around won't i have him bumped off ust do not wory bhaiwa
i could do anything for you
no it was a lady
so i was really vey polite
i was not offensive over the phone
Unless you get tough with these cops they are not going to mend their ways
Sure my respects bhaiwa
who the hell are you
who sent you here
because it was a lady you were vey polite
you weren't abusive on the phone eh
you know who i am
you know what it is to be abusive
you godamn
what the hell is all this
looks like you haven't heard what i said Solanki
Sir Kasim told us that this was the guy who threatened people on Gajraj's behalf
so
so what
you will thrash him in public like an animal
because he has made a few calls
if you are so scared of threats over the phone Solanki you ought to quit the police force
Shame on you
for your information the man you guys beat up happens to be a youth activist of Ramnath Mishra's political party
Ajay i do not want an explanation from you for what they did today
Ramnath Mishra has given this entire episode a political angle
he claims that because of the STF
UP has now become a police state
do we have any less problems to deal with that we had to enact a farce like this
what is up Tiwari ji
from Satyapal Mehra we had got information of 5 mobile phones
Four of them belonged to Gajraj but one belonged to Chaudhay
a Delhi based number
the phone has been activated for over an hour now
which means Chaudhay's in Delhi
that is what we hope
but only an analysis of the call details will give us a confirmation
while you handle the call details i will go and handle the ADG
all right
if there is another mistake i will personally ensure that the three of you are suspended
when did you reach Delhi Chaudhay
this morning Mishra ji
i had to come to make a collection or I'd have left for Nepal with Gajju bhaiwa
i had warned Gajraj not to take on the STF in a straight fight
but he just won't listen to anyone
Neither can i help him now nor can i
Gajju bhaiwa wants your help in the contract for the Delhi metro
all right have the papers sent
i will talk to the people here
i will do that and talk to you in detail when we meet Mishra ji
Good bye
Bye
Gajraj has landed us all in trouble
how long can we tolerate this
let's tolerate it as long as we can
we will find another away after that
this nation has no dearth of people like Gajraj
yes please verify the rest of the addresses too Tiwari ji
i will hold on please check the addresses
what are you doing
i am making a guest list of the people we want to invite at your wedding with Anamika
Tiwari ji i will call you later
Ma what are you talking about
about your marriage
is that wrong
no but
i have known Anamika for barely six or eight months
do not live under any illusions
the Major called this morning
he said it is exactly 11 months and 12 days since you met Anamika
how did the Major know all this
the bride's father knows eveything
and what you know about each other is good enough for now
the rest you can cary on with after your wedding
the wedding is taking place
do what you want to after that
if we could ask Anamika for her opinion
i have
she has no problems
do you have any
may i give Ramji a hand now
and i also have to make that guest list remember
so when did you arrive
Well the Major called the bride's father is supposed to know eveything that is when
These two numbers at the top are at Ramnath Mishra's Delhi residence
one is at a farmhouse in Mehrauli
These are the two numbers that are important to us
Goldie Car Servicing Centre
Right
located in the inner circle of Connaught Place
i have a feeling we will surely find a lead there
any special reason
yes
Chaudhay has called these two numbers 23 times from various phones between yesterday and the day before
and no call had a duration of less than four minutes
which means there is someone at the service station from whom Chaudhay is tying to extract some details
the question is when will Chaudhay actually come here
i am sick of listening to that song
Change the bloody tape
of course i will
what are you flaring up for
where the hell is Goldie
i had asked him to come here on time
the bastard
he is never on time
now listen to this song
so you are joining me in the STF
what else sir
this is the time to do something
with you
for you
Always
in the retaliatoy fire two gangsters died on the spot
while Rituraj Chaudhay was critically injured
on human grounds the STF rushed Chaudhay to the Ram Manohar lohia Hospital
and it was there that he was declared dead
anything else
Whatever our report contained is already there in the counter affidavit
what do you think Ajay
yes sir
we did not expect Chaudhay's brother to file a writ petition in the Delhi court
he has made several serious allegations
Exactly why we have come to you Mr Suri
that is okay Kapoor
you know how active the Human Rights Commission is in Delhi
if you had to undertake this operation you should've ideally arrested these gangsters
which is perhaps something you could well have done
Mr Suri if you want the police to operate in an ideal manner you must also provide them an ideal environment
with things being the way they are to deal with people like Chaudhay we will have to adopt underhand methods
if battles like this are fought within the framework of phony idealism we can vey well forget about winning
the allegations made in the writ petition could not withstand
Mr Suri's legal genius and the honourable High Court of Delhi dismissed the petition
on the other hand the morale of the Uttar Pradesh police received a boost with the continuing success of the STF
after ages even at the police station levels a close watch was kept on underworld activities
a rare spirit had come to possess the entire police force
at 534 19 seconds a call was made to 9891005280 the during was 25 seconds
Right
Tiwari ji i am going home
i can drop you on my way
there was information being relayed from Sayed Exchange
can i help you
Thank you
as my physics professor said a man must always cary his own burden
Your own burden okay
but you bear the burden of the whole department
are you still scared of it
Well yes
i mean
Strange stoy this one
you do not mind the song do you
what destination is this
neither does he know nor i
the operations of Uttar Pradesh's STF have revealed that some gangsters of eastern U P are now operating from Nepal
Under the protection of Pakistan's ISl these gangs are now involved in smuggling of arms printing and circulating counterfeit currency
it is now a question of internal security and it can not be tackled at the state level
we will need the help of specialised intelligence like the MW the IB and the Interpol
and we are already in discussions with the Centre
after spreading its tentacles in the railway contract racket the UP mafia is now extending a hand of friendship to international syndicates
According to latest information
Whatever you say Mishra ji
Gajraj has really shaken up Raghuvir's government
Asses
they are out to create a fearless society
the administration and the police they are all on tenterhooks
you were right
he is really a useful guy
he must only hold his ground
he won't be able to hold his ground like this
we will have to find a way to make him stand his ground
a bye election has been announced in the Gorakhpur assembly constituency
that is an absolutely safe seat
we will make Gajraj fight the elections there
but will he fight it
Why not
he is being drawn into the system
he will happily fight it
but won't the party's image take a beating if we publicly associate with him
not at all
he will fight as an independent candidate
we will only lend him outside support
but this is where he will have to come to fight the elections
and you know the STF are baying for his blood
if they see him somewhere they are going to shoot him
i have a solution to that problem too
Mind your luggage
Your stay has been arranged in Agra
this constable will keep you company
Phone me if there is a problem
and you needn't wory about Gajraj
Kasim
Kasim
have you finished packing
yes
Ma i have given all the numbers of Delhi to Ramji
Call me whenever you want to
i must leave Ma
look after yourself
it is righteousness that is always victorious
that is exactly why i am fighting it out Ma
According to intelligence reports Gajraj Singh was in Delhi
on that nightlong journey none of us slept
Eveyone firmly held on to their seats
there was a weird silence inside the van
for the next ten days Delhi became the STF's operational base
we got cracking as soon as we received news from investigators
we stepped up surveillance
the aim was clear and the intention was obvious
Target Gajraj Singh
and probably this was the finishing touch to the stoy
it is clear from his cellphone ID that he is located somewhere here between these two towers
then that is where we must focus
my point
but Chanakyapuri is a diplomatic location
Delhi police might object to our operations here
Fine
we will pick him up and cary out the operations at Mehrauli
Why not after a gallon of tea
Know what my Ma says Tiwari ji
when you are spent stand before the rising sun
it invigorates you
Did it invigorate you
my body yes
it is my mind's turn now
you know things are tense now
so why did you fix this place for the meeting
is the power of attorney ready
that is why the lawyer is here
but where are you
Nearby
Checking something
i am sending Dwivedi to pick you up
it is confirmed
the call's been traced
Gajraj is on a public phone outside Nizamuddin station
Mishra
Check Mishra's cellphone ID pronto
how long will it take to reach
at least 15 minutes in normal traffic
he might get away sir
he won't
Tiwari ji i think you should be coming
we may need you
Ajay sahib Gajraj has probably stepped out of the phone booth
no other way out
we came up with this idea after much consideration
listen Gajraj you got to surrender just once
besides these are formalities that cannot be overlooked
if you say so it is fine
Under whose jurisdiction will this surrender take place
Gorakhpur
it is my territoy
Eveything will be under my control
what if i am remanded to police custody
the police won't even touch you
Why do you wory
i have fixed eveything
you will be remanded to judicial custody
and yes the nomination papers will also be filed from jail
Tell me
i am in a meeting with Mr Mishra
i will tell him he will get it done
we will send this surrender application as soon as we reach
the day after or the next will be the date
then the game's yours
i need to go to the loo
Ajay sahib
Gajraj was talking on his cellphone
he is with Mishra
should be somewhere around here
looks like the entire STF team is here
i suspected Mishra all along
he must've called them
Discard the cellphone
C'mon
where is Gajraj
where the hell is Gajraj
Must've taken that train
C'mon Tiwari ji
the train seems empty
where is lokpal and the others
he just called
their compartment is blocked
okay move
Syed
Hold him
Tiwari ji place your hand here
Syed i will be back
Tiwari ji stay put
do not move from here
Tiwari ji what are you doing here
you need to be with Syed
Please go Tiwari ji
he is alive
i ran a check
our compartment is blocked
this is the only way out
is it the river
Appears so
Move
anything else Mr Tiwari
yes that is all
so that was the stoy of SSP Ajay Kumar
not his stoy alone
it was our stoy
Solanki
Baidyanath
Srihant
Yadav
lokpal

oh i guess if it is a clean break
i brought you some matches
he used to go out with the slutty girl that is throwing this party tonight
you went out with her
Look the only reason i said we would go is because she is afraid no one's gonna turn up
you spoke to her
yes when she invited me
do you think she is right about no one showing up
Well i am not going
Excuse me
Right back
See how fun this is
this is so fun

Everyone's depressed on New Year's Eve
Only you are depressed on New Year's Eve
i am having a great time
See
Drinking fighting loving the ladies

are you gonna be like this all night
yeah
Taxi

you have this whole ambivalent vibe radiating from your persona
something is wrong mama
oh i ju oh
Hmm
Oops
i uh
i am sorry
it is just this guy you know
Always is baby
yeah i was at this party and i saw him there and he was just so

Almost 8 30
oh
Yawns
Caitlyn
Call me
Look i have had it with him and i am not letting him push me into this old girlfriend party thing
Absolutely not
they only broke up 6 months ago right
Please they are practically still going out
Too bad in a way
he was the most successful artist
i have dated this year and he was kind of nice you know
Please
he was too nice
Going out with him was like take your medicine
huh
and then he takes me to his gallery today to see his new show
and it sucks
Ah
it sucked
yes
i can not even tell you
you would not even believe his work OK
it is like big abstract vaginas
or something
Ugh
i hate abstract
but at least he has a gallery
i mean that is something
Also he is really bad in bed
he is bad in bed
he is the worst
oh
OK so this is the address so you can check it out after work
i think there is gonna be a lot of people there
i mean
i am gonna be there
um with him
oh
OK
i mean i do not mean i am with him because we are just friends and we are not together
Shit
do you think he even heard me
it is inevitable you know
you let somebody move in with you you make all these little compromises to smooth things along and the next thing you know you are on some macrobiotic diet you are listening to Joni Mitchell
and then you know what they say
no
they tell you you have changed
you are not the same person i fell in love with
Well yeah
and then they dump you
what do you expect Kevin
i mean you go out with condescending emasculating women
you need to find somebody that likes you the way you are
and who would possibly like me the way i am
i have no idea
now finish your drink because i wanna get that guy back over here
Shatters
where are we gonna go huh
we do not know anybody
Well maybe we will meet somebody
what
you know maybe we will meet some people
what are you on another fuckin' planet
Val you do not just meet people on the street
Even when you go to a party you do not meet people
you just stand around talking to the ones you already know
Well we are just gonna keep walking all right
i will know it if i see it
it is gotta be around here somewhere
i been there once before
Call your mother
my mother
yeah she is got your cousin's number do not she
i can not call her
she thinks i am sleeping at your house tonight
Listen to me

we either call your mother for the number or we get back on a train to Ronkonkoma
you are so uncool
you just stay the fuck away from B
OK so do you wanna stop and get a drink
i do not know
do you
yes yes
i do
it is early
i hate getting to a party before everybody else so
Great
OK
Ha ha
we can get a drink
i mean if you want to
i do not wanna force you to drink against your will
do you wanna stop or not
Sure

Look Jack we do not have to do this
i thought you said you wanted a drink
no
i mean about going to the party
you do not wanna go to the party
no
Look it is just it is New Year's Eve
you do not have to spend it with me
i mean just because of
can i just say something
i am sensing a real reluctance on your part to tell me what you would like to do tonight
Really
Really
and i think it is natural if you feel a little bit awkward here you know considering but there is no reason why we can not just go to the party and have a good time tonight OK
OK
OK
now do you want to go to the party
Heh sure
all right
if you want to
Arrgh
Let's get a drink
OK
Nobody's coming

Moaning and Mumbling

Being specific that made you decide to you know
oh yeah OK yeah right

Look uh as an actor
Cindy i find myself very intrigued by people's motivations
Mm hmm
Look you are you are a very attractive girl
you must have had lots of opportunities
Especially as pretty as you are
i am surprised it hasn't happened by accident so a guy has to wonder what makes him so great
Well one thing i remember about last night was

the most what
oh God

Lucy do you want to fuck
because if you really really want to fuck we will fuck OK
you do not think i am serious
how long have we known each other
in the ln the 5 years we have known each other have you once even ever considered having sex with me
Apart from tonight
you do not think i am attracted to you
i do not think you are attracted to half the men you sleep with
you think i am a slut
what
no
yeah you think i am a big slut
i do not think you are a slut
a
a stanky little ho maybe but never a slut
the truth is you are afraid
what
i am afraid
i am yeah OK you
i feel so naked right now
i am totally afraid
it is so obvious
and so ridiculous
Prove it
i do not have to prove anything
i dare you
Kevin i dare you to fuck me
what
so what now
you want to go to some smelly bathroom and uh have loveless New Year's sex in the stench of air freshener
Unless you are chicken
so we got to go back to the club to deliver this package to my friend Tony

Well i am leaving
where you going
i am going to the train station to get out of here before these jerks get us killed
you wanted to hang out with the bands right
These guys are musicians
they are roadies Val
there is a little difference
i did not want to have to tell you this
' cause i know you are gonna spaz out but the last train for Ronkonkoma

we gotta book
you coming
yeah we are coming
Whispers

Caitlyn your skirt's been over your head for hours
Jesus like it is my fault i am irresistible to men
Look he wants me
not you me
you think so
yeah i do think so
Hey guys
hi
hi
Listen i think it is still a bit early for this party
what do you say we go get some cocktails
Eric
for some reason every single woman i go out with ends up breaking up with me
i mean why is that Monica
i do not know
Lots of reasons probably
yeah right
yeah it is always lots of reasons
i have never got a straight answer out of one of you
Like you
what was your reason
oh really Eric who remembers
you do not remember
it was only 6 months ago
Well 6 months is a long time
no 6 months is nothing
Jesus Eric relax
OK fine
you do not remember the lame excuse you gave me 6 months ago for breaking up with me
i will tell you
you like me as a friend but not as a boyfriend even though you found me attractive
that is not lame
it makes no sense whatsoever
i think it makes sense
See
that is what i am talking about
that is what i have to deal with
These insane leaps of reasoning
and they sound logical at first until later
Until you go home sit down and think about them
and then it is like what
Really Eric you just got to calm down
Look all i am asking for is the truth
if you want to break up with me fine
Just tell me the reason why
is that too much to ask
i am stupid
what are you doing
i am going home
but you just got here
Eric please please do not do this
do not go
OK fine i won't go home
Tell me the truth and i will stay
what
Tell me the real reason you broke up with me and i will stay
OK OK OK OK i will do it
oh God
i can not speak for Bridget or any of the others
Fine
but for me just for me
the truth is i broke up with you because you were the worst lover
i ever had in my life
what
i am serious
Even counting high school it was it was bad

it is not that
oh the time i fell asleep
Woman i was tired
i mean i am only human for Christ's sake
it was not that either OK
Well what then
what was so horrible that you never even gave me a chance
i mean a person can make progress you know
i mean there is techniques you can learn and books you can buy
no
i do not think that would've helped
so i am hopeless
that is it
i am hopeless
you still have your work
oh
my work
my work
of course
Thank you
Thank you
i feel fantastic now
Eric look some things just can not be helped you know
yep
i understand

i am the worst lover you ever had
and now you tell me it can not be helped
Look i am sorry that what is her face dumped you
OK
and i am sorry that you are so bad in bed
i really am
but most of all i am sorry that i decided to throw this atrocity this nightmarish ordeal of a New Year's party because this is breaking me Eric
do you understand me
this party is breaking me
Nnhh
you do not have to get so emotional
i mean it is not that bad
it is not that bad
it is not that bad
Eric we are standing here with one hostess who is on the verge of hysteria and one guest one guest who spent the entire evening coming to terms with his sexual problems OK
that is it
that is my party
Happy fucking New Year
how could i have been so stupid
Wait up
of course Ellie's gonna show up tonight given that it is the worst possible thing that could happen
i am never gonna forgive you for this Lucy
it is not my fault your girlfriend caught us making out in a bathroom stall
you know i did not hear any complaints when your hands were up my dress
you know this is a big joke to you but this is my life
you do not understand
you should be thanking me for helping you sever a totally unhealthy relationship
Thanking you
my life is totally screwed up now because of you
Your life has been totally dark evil and nihilistic since the day i met you
it never gets any better
you are so depressed Kevin
the only reason i keep you around as my friend is because you make my life look great by comparison
oh thank you
what a humanitarian
Your life's a rose
Maybe i should leave
Maybe you should
where you going
to find that bartender
the bartender
Well that is just perfect
Give him my regards
i will
Fuck you
Fuck you
Just remember i was the one that wanted to stay home tonight Lucy

Mm
Mm
Giggles
Hey you OK over there
Wow

the whole topic makes me uncomfortable
Look let's just forget everything and we will go to the party
OK
Come on
Go to the party with me
be careful on the ice
i would not go to that party with you if you were the last man on Earth
Come on do not do this Cindy
oh go to hell
Aah
Aah aah oh God
oh my God
oh
God
you all right
no
i think i landed in a big pile of dog shit
Eww
Eww
oh God i am so embarrassed
it is not that bad
Really
it is not that bad
oh leave me alone
Jesus i hate you
you are just such a big phony
it is like you are not nice at all
i never said i was nice
you are the one who kept going on all night about how nice i was
oh you are so conceited
what are you talking about
you think i haven't noticed
i mean ever since you found out i was a virgin before last night you have been hounding me for a reason why
Why did i choose you
what was it about you
you you you
that is all you care about
i was curious
Listen you think there was something special about you
Well guess what
it could've been anybody
yeah that is right
you were just there
i would have gone home with anybody last night
i just wanted to get it over with
it could've been anybody
OK date's over
Look why do not we just end this date right here OK
that is fine with me
we will both go home and if we are lucky we will never have to see each other again
Sounds perfect
Great
Wanna share a cab
Fine
Fine
i bet that Cheryl person hates you too
yeah
her and every other woman in New York
Taxi
so common so typical so similar
you men are so similar in your mediocrity
you are like a pack of Philistines
These matches are disappointing me
here you go baby
i can not be babied but thank you
you see what i did
i said thank you
that is courtesy
and courtesy and manners are what women know
Men you get into a relationship and the woman is so willing to sublimate her needs to guide her man through the important signposts of life lovingly
Very lovingly
and then you turn your back for 24 hours and you go into a public restroom and there he is making out with another woman
do you see what i am saying
oh i feel you
and who do i have to blame
i have myself to blame because i have dated enough narcissistically neurotic men to know that you are all just a pack of roaming babies in search of a giant teat from which to suck the life blood out of me until i am a hollow shell
what
Well baby all this talk about teats just made me think i should say something
uh i am sensing a lot of hostility coming from the back seat
oh really
that is very astute
Well that is not good for me man
that kind of energy damages the plush interior of my cab right
and you are blowing a 5 00 high mama
you need to find yourself a man who is secure enough to appreciate you for the superior woman that you are
i like a strong woman
oh yeah
Mm hmm
and you are a strong woman
if i was you i would pull over with me and celebrate our strength together
what do you think about that baby
this corner's great
this corner's fantastic for me
Well let's do that
i did not know you wanted to pull over so soon but i will tell you what do you wanna make slow passionate love or should i leave the meter running
Baby
Baby
Baby actually left
Mm mm mm
now let me see
Did i smile
i must not have smiled
that is what it was
Bridget
that was a total waste of time
Really law school
that is so yuppie
do you believe him going on about real estate all night
what is it with guys where they think you give a shit about their stuff
oh
there he is
Bridget
you think this is too mean ditching him this way
Caitlyn
Please the law school thing is bad enough but what is with the cowboy shirt and the gladiator hair
Bridget
Really
oh and you might want to try a new approach
this whole thing with the matchbooks is so predictable
what do you expect
i am under a deadline
what time is it anyway
oh my God
what
we have got an hour
an hour
are you serious
Come on
Wait a minute
the last thing
the last day of 1981
i do not care

i do not care
we do not care
i do not care
about this world
i do not care
about that girl
i do not care
Moans
Eric
oh yeah
that is good
oh that is so good
Monica Whimpers
you see it is all in the technique
most people they underestimate the importance of the rotational thrust
Eric you are hurting my skin
Well that is just great
Ow
you know i do not think i am the one with the problem here Monica
i think it is you
i think you are blaming me for being bad in bed because you are clearly stunted in some way physically
it is not my fault you are an emotional cripple
Well that is so typical of a woman
it is all about emotions and intimacy and feelings and all that vague ambiguous bullshit
it is sex
that is it
two people in a bed getting off
not some ethereal thing out there to embrace humanity
Look you wanted to know why you were bad in bed and i told you
you do not have to bite my head off just because you are inadequate
oh now i am inadequate
Mm hmm
you think i am inadequate
yeah
Well you just take that god awful dress off and i will show you who is adequate honey
what are you doing
i am gonna prove you wrong
that is right
i am gonna have you on your hands and knees begging for mercy
Grunts
oh my God
are you insane
Jesus there is nobody here yet
uh Eric's here
Eric right
hi
hi i am Hillary
i just love your flowers
my what
Your you know your flowers
Jesus you scared me half to death
Wanna beer
what are you still doing with that package
i thought we were getting out of here already
yeah well Tony's not here yet so we will just stick around and see if he shows up
Great
Man that is a cool party huh
it is retarded
i wanna leave
oh yeah
Well where do you want to go
Ronkonkoma
what
you know Ronkonkoma
yeah well it is on Long Island
Long Island huh
i am from Jersey
Congratulations
yeah
so uh can i ask you a question
it is a free country
Well did Val say something to you about me
because i thought we were really hitting if off there for a while
i mean it felt like she really liked me you know and now she is in there making out with Dave and i am just wondering i mean did i do something to offend her
you know how it is
yeah
it is like when i first met Val though you know
i was like whoa
this is the one
this is the one
because the thing with Val is you know she is different
i mean she is just like this little girl and i you know
i wanted to like i wanted to get near her and i wanted to be with her you know her big eyes her big round head you know
i just thought maybe you know i was falling in
i mean you know maybe this is
i do not know
i mean
all right you probably think it is really jerky huh
Sayin' somethin'' cause i just met her
Look can i tell you something here
because this is like the worst night of my life OK
i mean i am standing here in a basement on fucking Avenue D so i am sorry if you are having troubles finding the right girl and everything
but i am just trying to get the fuck home before somebody kills me all right
all right
yeah i can see that
yeah

Please
do not let this feeling end
it may not come again
and i want to remember
how it feels to touch you
how i feel so much
since i found you
Looking through the eyes of love
i got you some flowers
uh mind if i sit down
i am with someone
Wh
you are with someone
you understand
what the bartender
he is in the bathroom
he is going to be right back
you know what
you should just go home
that is what you wanted to do
Just go home and do not worry about me
' cause i am set for the night
Look you just met this guy
so
so do not you think it seems a little sudden or something to be
you are much more judgmental between girlfriends
have you ever noticed that Kevin
Fine
all right
you want to throw yourself at some guy you just met it is your business
i am going home
oh
there
Thanks
OK
Look
what
the thing is
what i what i want to say what i am
yes
yes Kevin
Let's do it
what
i think we should do it
you have got to be kidding
i am serious
i think we should go back to the coffee shop and just do it
what do you say
Come on
you in
you know what
i can not just leave the bartender
it is my birthday
we are practically obligated to do it
you said so yourself
Come on
i dare you
i dare you to fuck me

Ain't no big thing
Cabbie
Mmm mmm mmm
to wait for the bell to ring
Deep thing
Tain't no big thing
the toll of the bell
Hillary
do you mean to tell me she actually broke up with you on New Year's Eve
Eric
i
i was flabbergasted
Well obviously she was threatened by your creativity
Your work it is so brilliant so powerful
you think so
oh absolutely
what other reason could there be
See i
i have always been fascinated by the female form
oh
Take you Hillary
you would make a wonderful artist's model
you have an almost perfect symmetry
i have been working out
Ohh i can see that
Burps
you really seem to understand my thrust
i guess i do
i can not believe i almost went home earlier
i feel exactly the same way
can i get you another drink
Hillary you should come down to the studio and take a look at my work before my next show
Really
i mean of course
Great
both Laugh
Taxi
oh great
Just drive right past me
like i am not even here
Look can i just say something
i am not speaking to you Jack
i think you will feel a little better if you hear me out
Look what happened between us last night is like this ongoing problem with me
it
it happens all the time
i meet someone we go home together but then the next day it is
what
next day what
Well they tell me that suddenly they have developed these feelings for me
W what are you saying
that every woman you go home with falls in love with you or something
yes
it is like a curse
it never ends
a woman falls in love with you and you think that is a curse
you have no idea
no
i do not because i think you are lucky
i mean there are some people who wait their entire lives for somebody to tell them they feel that way about them and you you just throw it away
like it is nothing
like it is a minor inconvenience
Well let me tell you something Jack
you are cursed just not the way you think you are
Well then how
Good bye Jack
where you going
Whistles
Taxi
Cindy wait
you can not leave
you got dog shit on your back
Your dress
Fuck me

Taxi
Lady

Get away from that cab
we have an emergency
292 Great Jones Street
oh you know baby you better tell me that when we get moving
i am a little intoxicated
it is New Year's Eve
Ha ha
i can not believe that you are so hard up that you'd go for that lawyer
i suppose now you want him for yourself huh
you are so paranoid
or maybe you want Eric and the lawyer
is that it
Hey hey
Please
Please do not touch me
Too much hostility
can you just get the car to move
you know baby in life sometimes you got to stay still to move forward
what
would you like a cigarette
yeah
yeah come on
here you go
you know this song always reminds me of me and my buddy Twain
Twain was my best friend a few years back till we fell in love with the same girl
Mmm
Pretty girl
Foxy
anyway Twain was the smooth one
you know i was a shy little knuckle head kid
i had no Afro back then so you know i was not was not smooth
anyway one night i went to a restaurant bump into Twain and the girl of my dreams eating dinner
i sat in the back of the restaurant and watched them eat dinner all goddamn night
first they had a little finger food wine cheese the whole thing and the whole time i am sitting over there
i said i wish that that was me
next thing i know
Twain bite into a string bean and choked to death right in the middle of the goddamn restaurant
Mmm
Hmm
i always thought it could've been me
it should've been me
this song always make me think about that
Mmm
Silky ho
i will never forget her
so what are you saying love kills
no
he is saying we should not fight about these guys and personally i think he is right
oh i know i am right baby
what if for the sake of our friendship we just decided to leave the party alone tonight
Laughs
you you mean no guys at all
that sounds much better doesn't it
uh huh
you mean we go home alone no guys at all even if it means we get jinxed for the whole year
that is the kind of sacrifice
i am willing to make for our friendship
Laughs
Well
OK
OK
OK
what is happening in this cab right now is beautiful
it is beautiful
is there any way that you can get this car to just move

Laughs
i
no i do not think you are crazy
Sniffs
Hey man you smell dog shit
Did you know that cigarettes are a shield against meaningful interaction with other people
it is true
i read it
People protect themselves emotionally by relating to their cigarettes instead of each other
that is what struck me last night watching all those people standing around with their cigarettes
Why is everyone so afraid
Why are people so scared of each other
Like us
no
we have never been anything but totally honest with each other
them

more than this
you know there is nothing
more than this
anyway i think it is time to quit smoking
Mm hmmm
more than this
Lucy
so then you will get grumpy and cranky and fat and you will whine and you will bitch and you will lose all your inspiration and you are gonna blame me
Cabbie
although i went to a crazy New Year's Eve party after i put the cab up i mean
i got pictures
Look here
now these two girls in this picture oh i could not understand a damn thing they said a and where in the hell is Ronkokomano
now this guy here he is a famous necrophiliac with a album
he kept dragging a dead girl around the party
it was real weird
Look at his eyes man
he crazy
Look at her
Dead dead dead
this dude right here i call vagina puppet man
' cause he kept making vagina puppets with his hands but he is a real talented fella
i mean i see big things in his future
' cause there is a market for vaginas
oh this girl right here keeps feeding people little weenies but i think she want a weenie herself if you know what i am saying
uh now this little girl here
i picked her up earlier that night too
it is a small city ain't it
that must be the guy she was telling me she was so nervous about being with
Just when he started making a little headway would not you know one of the ugliest bitches
i have ever seen in my life rolled up and i am not one to call women ugly but i think this woman was because she had a penis
oh there is Dutch boy with uh the girl from Rankakomano
i ain't going to call her young but i am going to tell you this
i bet you she write a couple love letters in crayons here and there
there i go

i am having fun right here
Almost having fun and here go my man right here
Remember him
this guy would not
listen to me man
he got 2 girls do not know what to do with either of them

she got into it with little girl right there and next thing i know he is rolling with big girl but dig this right
little girl scored with the necrophiliac
Thank God he brought a live one home if you know what i am saying
now this guy is hungry for love or something and then who walks over but my little girl pretty in pink and it looks like he found what he wanted that is until her nose started bleeding
then they was hugging then they was smiling then they was kissing
now i think i am 4 more pages away from ecstasy if you know what i am saying
oh the guy in the middle that is the guy from Happy Days
i met him got his autograph and everything
uh Potsy
the people was dancing they was laughing if that party got any crazier
i bet you Rick James would've walked right through the door
Look at this party
These pictures here i am keeping forever
they make me happy' cause they remind me if you relax you can have a good time baby even if you smell like dog shit
See in the end everybody got what they was looking for a little love and i got what i was looking for a little booty
you can see it in my eyes
that is my booty look right there

Wall to wall
People hypnotized
and they are stepping
Lightly
Hang each night
in rapture
Music Changes

she moves like she do not care
Smooth as silk cool as air
Ooh it makes you want to cry

she doesn't know your name
and your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh it makes you want to die

Ooh do not you wanna take her

Wanna make her all your own

Maria
you have gotta see her

Go insane and out of your mind
Regina
Ave Maria

a million and one candlelights
Rap Beat

there is no sin in this
Gettin' dressed to kill
Laughin' down the sun like a jackal will
with his eyes ablaze and his lips apart
he is gonna fill his cup with the love in your heart
and drink it up till the morning starts
Circulate the red light vistas
Get the girls then get their sisters
Pinch'em up and give'em blisters
Kiss'em fierce with all his might forever
Ever ever
Standing on the verge on the edge of the ledge
Waitin' for me to fall
then i gotta call that said
Wait homed up homie you must be trippin'
you can be puttin' that sippin' and whippin'
Up in your bippin' you better stand tall
Fool you was born to ball
Took a little fall and now you want to end it all
Radio Transmission

Yo rock this and slam dance to this
Move back when you see us in the mosh pits
Smash some we might have female rap stompin'
Crack more heads over them backs
you and your man floated Tales from the Crypt
Rocky Horror could not pitch it away
Come on
Get your goosebumps tinglin'
Out of the darkness spark this
Total chaos marked skin the hardest
nothing could save us all that is sacred
Dearly departed Brave heart slave contained
something courageous the road rats explode
New rigors that devour
do not cry for me i am proud drunk off the power
the power the power
who is gonna cry
for ya
who is gonna cry
over you
you think you are infamous Mark remains untamed
and you out for the cash like you out for the fame
Lay back on the stack down the kodiak
Right in my rap's head Hold that
Look out we saw the sound blast
but none heard the sound of the blast
the man's out of control
the system bounced back
but he cracked up Verbal assault
Quick to lash out
you are stunned momentarily dropped
Seconds after
then when you least expect it
you understand there is no exit
Hey yo
who is gonna cry
for ya
who is gonna cry
Music Changes

two dozen other dirty lovers
must be a sucker for it
Cracked up but i do not need my mother
Just hold my hand while i come
to a decision on it

Sooner or later
Your legs give way you hit the ground
Save it for later
do not run away and let me down
Sooner or later
you hit the deck you get found out
Save it for later
do not run away run away
and let me down
do not run away run away and let me down
do not run away run away
Run away run away
Run away run away run away

if you remember anything that i tell you remember this
James Brown is the baddest motherfucker in show business Napisy pobrane z http napisy org nowa wizja napiswhi ready to order
do you have anything that is really special
not according to my high school guidance counselor
i will have the veggie plate
but instead of beets i want kale
and instead of broccoli more kale
i want the veggies steamed
and instead of dressing i want lemons
do not you need to write this down
i am afraid if i start writing that down it will turn into a suicide note
i am assuming this table's gonna have a lot more of those requests
yes i could tell by the hats
Sync corrected by honeybunny www addic7ed com
Earl i have something new i want you to try
that is the exact same sentence that got me hooked on cocaine in the'80s
it is my new cupcake flavor
Delicious dark chocolate the ladies can not help but love
i am calling it the Earl
i know you got that right
hi i am here
i was running late so i decided to hail a cab
and then i remembered i did not have any money on me
and then i remembered i did not have any money at all
so i walked the whole way here
the apartment's three blocks away
yes i know
Three blocks and 15 Hola chicas away
Well you can not be late again
i am already worried about me being late every month
on my way here a homeless man asked me for money
and i told him that i usually always give but that my father was indicted in a Ponzi scandal and i have lost my family fortune and my Manhattan townhouse so i have been sleeping on a couch in Brooklyn but in spite of it all i am still optimistic that you and i will achieve success in our exciting new cupcake business venture
and look what he gave me
you took money from a homeless man
i prefer to think of Bob near the bridge as our first investor
Pickup
Special sandwich
i can think of even more special sandwich
you me and the hot blonde giraffe
Well she recently lost her dignity so you might have a shot
hello today
i have nametag for you
Only your second day and look nametag already
as new owner i am killing it
Thank you
oh it says Carolin
it is Caroline
with an E
i am Caroline
as new owner i am sucking it
Just put it on
you can not tell an Asian he made a mistake
he will go in the back and throw himself on a sword
Thank you Mr Lee
you may call me Han
H a n
no trap in my name
i am thinking we should take the first step in our new cupcake business by writing Max's Homemade Cupcakes up on the specials board
no i can not have my name up there
everyone i owe money to thinks i live in Seattle
oh we used to own Seattle
Max we have got to get the name out there
Create a buzz
Ooh good idea
Let's create a buzz
Exactly in order to launch
i am mocking you
when in doubt i am always mocking you
Seriously Max
this new cupcake business is our lifeline
a way out for both of us
and i wanna thank you again for letting me move in
if there is anything i can do to help you
you mean besides starting to wait on tables
i meant anything i can do to help you through your breakup with Robbie
oh
Thanks but i am fine
and we are working
Well one of us is
are you sure you are fine
' Cause i heard you crying last night
i do not cry
i sold my tear ducts to an organ bank for cash two years ago
i was on the couch
and i heard you crying alone in your bedroom
Really
what did the crying sound like
Like
Moaning
i was not crying
Well then what were you d
oh
so none of my business
that is right
and remember that
got it
in fact let's just say that anything having to do with my bedroom my tables or my life you should stay away from
Boundaries
got it
and please do not tell anyone at work
i let you move into my apartment
that is one boundary we both do not want crossed
Why
Hey roomies
that is why
Hope those sheets are okay
oh do not worry about it
i know they are the best you could afford
not really
the good ones are on my bed
Max that oven is so hot
could you do me a favor and open the back door
we have known each other two days and you are already asking for back door
Dear God
i forgot you are Equestrian Barbie
you came with a horse
no
Out horse bad
Bad horse
Chestnut
Snaps
no need to yell he is a champion
Champion stink bomb
it is smelling pretty ripe out in that yard
that is not Chestnut that is Brooklyn
okay well i am watching the Champion drop some steaming hot Brooklyn right now
Max i have been thinking about how you completely overreacted to your name up on the specials board
do you think it is a fear of success
i am too poor to have a fear of success
at Wharton Business School we learned that every new venture can bring up a certain amount of fear
is there any way to do a yelp review of Wharton Business School
Maybe you are having a hard time imagining this cupcake business could ever even happen because nobody ever believed in you or your dreams
i am guessing
i can make this happen Max
for me for you for us
Just keep making those amazing cupcakes
and i will do the rest till you believe
i believe everything you just said and that children are the future
Max it is me
i know it is you
you sleep with a knife under your pillow
it is the only home security system i can afford
and i am a cutter
i can not sleep on that couch
i think Ikea might be the Scandinavian word for sciatica
and there is weird sounds in the street
and i do not have my white noise machine
Well that is Puerto Rican noise
you will get used to it
can i just lay down here and get a little sleep
i do not even let the men i sleep with sleep with me
i can not get into your issues right now
i just need to sleep
Fine get in then
what is that
Potato chips
i sleep eat
Cool ranch and bacon
Dude they are delicious
because of your breakup with Robbie
Just get in
i have to be in the city to babysit in five hours
oh great you are like a nightlight
you are so blonde
Thank you
Door creaks
Max someone's in the living room
Max someone's in the bedroom
Robbie
what is up babe
Robbie what are you doing here
we broke up
Still
yes still
you hit on me
and then she caught you with someone else in these very sheets
which i am hoping she washed
oh i get it
you blew me off' cause you like the ladies
which is cool
i like the ladies too
and right now it is the two ladies i like
Robbie if i were gonna go lesbian she would be the last les I'd bian
Listen babe
you really hurt her
Stop
she sleep eats trans fats thanks to you
here stuff all of these in your mouth
got it your thing
i will be quiet
Robbie this is not cool at all
Mm mm
Showing up here after what you did
you go girl
i have something to say to you and you had better listen
Ooh hoo hoo hoo
what are you the relationship ghost
Robbie just go
i can not say what i need to in front of the relationship ghost
i will call you to come get your stuff and we can talk then
Leave the key
Straight up Max you are breaking my heart
you are the only woman that i feel this way about
here
Ladies i do not know what is going on here but it would've been a lot sexier if i was in it
are you okay
if you wanna talk i am here
can i get a hit off that
you think these are good
God we are poor
Morning
it is a beautiful day
These shades belong down
from now on think of me as a vampire without all the annoying marketing
Bad news
a pipe broke in the street so the water's off
Good news when i went out to get us two coffees
i spoke to Juan and Javier two city workers
and they assured me the water'll be on no later than 3 00
i also stopped at the health food store and got us a fresh squeezed juice to split
it is ginger apple strawberry
that was the name of the hooker who had this apartment before me
what is this
from me
it says Thanks for letting me sleep in your bed last night
i prefer my usual cash on the bedside table
when i went to the cute coffee place
i spoke to the counter girl Nabulangi
if someone named Nabulangi is making an appearance in the first sentence i have to sit down
and she said her manager'll be in at 11 00
so i thought I'd chanel it up walk on over there introduce myself and your fabulous cupcakes
that is exactly what i was gonna do
i am just gonna go say good bye to Chestnut and get going
you know having only one cute outfit takes hours off getting dressed
oh
that is a lot of fresh Brooklyn
Morning Chestnut
it is a beautiful
no
Way
Whimpering
Look Chanel Number two
Tell me it is mud
T tell me it is mud
it is mud
what is that
a carrot
there is carrots in the mud
there is no water
oh get it off me please
Please do something
Just get it off me get it off me
Stop
this is dry clean only
Max please please take me somewhere they have a hot shower i beg of you
Calm down it is just mud
Max please screams
do not touch me
Thank you so much for taking me to shower at your babysitting job
Well i did not have much of a choice
you pulled the pillow knife on me
i will just introduce myself to your boss and tell her what happened
Look i do not want Peach to know you were here
this is a job
not a meet and greet
got it
you get in there you take a five minute shower clean it up and go
Fine i will hide in the hallway till she is gone
no need just follow me in
she never really looks at me
Morning
hi Max
Go
Hey Peach
uh hair and makeup
what is the big occasion
Pilates
Max good news
they found a way to make diamonds more sparkly
i got Brad and Angelina a playdate with another set of twins in the building
it starts in five minutes
Cool what are their names
6B
Bye bye Brangelina
Mommy loves you
Guys
before you leave stop at this one
Angelina could use a little help
Contour that neck she is a fatty
Peach come on that is baby fat
Still kids can be cruel
do not you listen to your mommy Angelina
she never eats
oh no she doesn't
here it is
Caroline with an E
i have your new and correct nametag
oh thank you Han
oh
i have seen something i should not have
i will just put correct nametag here on counter
so sorry but many thank yous
what are you doing
i know you said you do not want it up there
but now that you see it
how does it feel
it feels like you are not listening to me at this job or at my other job
i said a five minute shower and get out
Did you take a nap at Peach's
the thread count was calling to me
Peach found blonde hairs in her bed and thought her husband was cheating on her
which he is but that is not the point
you almost ruined a perfectly happy fake marriage and there are innocent children involved
Well i have some good news
Look it is Nabulangi
i invited her in to taste your amazing cupcakes
and when she loves them we will have an in at her bakery
Come over and say hello
no i can not now
i wanna call Robbie before we get too busy
Tell him when to come over and get his stuff
Max wait
no do not distract me
i wanna sound cool and hot and all like
you can not have me anymore sucka
Max
Robbie it is me
Classy burp on your outgoing message
Max i
no
i need you to come get your stuff tomorrow
i do not know how you have been surviving without your chin up bar and Axe body spray
Max hang up
i already called him
you called Robbie
you have done so much for me
i wanted to do something for you too
so i called Robbie and i had him come over and i gave him his stuff
now you won't have to go through with all that mess
and i think you'd be pleased i really let him have it
what is with you and boundaries
you are in my bed you are in my boss' bed and now you go and call Robbie
you are like you are like your big ass horse
Charging in everywhere you do not belong
i thought i was doing you a favor
in spite of what you say about the sounds i heard coming from your bedroom the other night
i know you are upset
i was masturbating
i love my job
i need to see you outside
now
do not get involved with her
she takes money from the homeless
not true Bob's an investor
be right back
Good cupcake right
Max i do not know how smart that was blowing by our only potential business contact
you stole my breakup scene
the only remotely good thing about breaking up with a guy is telling him how much better you are than him when you give him back his stuff
i do not know if you noticed but my entertainment budget is pretty low and i was really looking forward to that
and then you went and stole it
but i guess you could not help it
' cause that is what you channings do you steal things
huh
Interesting
okay you wanted a breakup scene
you are in one
i am breaking up with you
oh okay
the cupcake business is over the dream is dead
oh i am sure Nabulangi will be devastated
i do not need you or your cupcakes to survive
i will figure something else out
because aside from your constant Wharton putdowns
i am a business genius and i will always land on my feet
oh really
' Cause today you kind of landed on your front
we are done
after work tonight i will get my things and be gone
Ooh you gonna load up your dream filled wheelie bag and ride away on sir muds a lot
Go ahead
be as negative as you want
' Cause you are in charge of your own future again
oh joke's on you
i do not have a future
Max
are you up
no
Max are you mad
yes
are you up and mad
no and yes
oh your bed's so soft
that is my boob
i know i moved out but i came back
i took the rest of our dead dream money and bought some cocktails for myself and some people
and myself
Did you bring me back any of those
' Cause i can not listen to this sober
Max
i have nothing
i really need the cupcake business
i can be different
no you can not
no i can not
but i can be better
Please
Please let's do this
i know you have a fear of success
you do because no one ever believed in your dreams
but i believe in your dreams
we have a dream
God you are so drunk
so you probably won't even remember this
i am sorry i said that stuff about your father
Did you hear me
Max are you up
Hey do you have any more of those poor people chips
what is up hangover three
Why are these up
i thought we were vampires
here i took the rest of last night's cupcake money and brought you a coffee and a fresh juice
which means that after two days in business we are 23 down from where we were
so we are still building our cupcake business
Sure
all we need is how much 250 000
which is awesome
Max i am sorry i crossed all those boundaries
it is cool
me and drunk Caroline worked it all out
in fact
she signed this paper
i drunk Caroline am a
what is that word
Punk ass ho
Thanks
i drunk Caroline am a punk ass ho
i promise to keep my big mouth shut
and replace all of Max's poor people chips
i will no longer meddle in her relation chips
you laughed about that until you threw up
oh and if you are wondering no the puke stains will not void this contract
God
i forgot again that we have a horse
Max get him out of here
he doesn't know i am a waitress
Chestnut
he is a champion
he learned that a lot faster than you did

and that is that
she is doing this on purpose a week before the wedding
what is she doing on purpose
i am defending the family honour against that that
i hate saying what
now just say it say it

Maybe you only needed my Venca to save the girl's honour
Shut up will you
of course
who knows the kid could be anyone's
it stinks to high heaven all these men around
what did you say
i can smell blood Father
Help me up girls
' T would be small wonder

She'd say this about my girl
i am not scared of you
Smell my fist
Hold me back
where are you
or i will make her mug uglier still
Look at her getting an attack

Mummy please

and find a better match for Blazena
you won't become Mrs Konopnik
you gave me a fright
how did all this come about
what
what do you mean
you mean her
we had coffee
what did she say
what she said
she said to be in Prague now
and that her man died or so
that she earns good money
and the child
Wendy's her name
I'd never have thought you and she
do not start the same you
it is like a put up job
Excuse me but
Excuse me
if i had her here I'd
she is gone to Vienna for 10 days
Ten days
so you and she really did not
she laid just anyone
you know her do not you do not tell me
but i did not
I'd rather hide somewhere
so it could've been anyone's and she throws it at you
but what will you do now
Blazena won't have you and you will surely not marry her will you
You'd be a fool to
so what now
Leave me alone
you are as bad as the priest's old hags
i should've known it is your kid
what would she want me for
Just look at me
Who'd marry me except some
some what
a crazy short sighted farmhand
Crazy short sighted
Telling you is like using a loudspeaker
a good gossip's your scene instead of cooking a hot meal
i made hamburgers yesterday
that is all you ever make
it is healthy
yes that is true
Why get married anyway
i am asking myself
i do not need anything
you monster
of course
i can not look Venca in the eyes now
i told you not to tell but off you go a trumpeting
my reputation now
Imagine yourself in Blazena's shoes
I'd drown poison and hang myself
Better and better
You'd get rid if me
you see
you won't tell Eva will you
there is nothing to tell
what do you mean there is nothing to tell
D'you mean to say Gaby told you
Venca's the kid's a father
who else surely not you
Surely not you
that would be the hell of a choice
yeah she told me too that it was Venca s
you see
any problems

Just a moment
Television

we will be expecting you
i am Radl the Chief
Understand
OK
Saturday morning then early
and come as soon as you can
Bye bye salute
on Friday

you can listen in
Joseph II arrange the equipment
you beast
do you happen to know chairman we sing that Walkyrie song and how
in the year sixty six when peace will be everywhere and you will be an engineer and we will be going out together along the path to Protivin which is so short
what are you doing
See i do not need any equipment
the best collective
that will be something
it is either the Skopek or Konopnik woman
how will you decide
Heavens above
LAST D AYS OF POMPE Y
no
Chairman
it will be a fiasco
which of em works better this week will be on television' hello
Hey Rob it is Steve
' Hiya'
' how are you' Good
Listen are you free next week to go away
' Where'
it is kind of a tour a tour of the north
a restaurant tour
Really good restaurants
'Right'
' Why me' Mischa can not come and i do not want to go alone
i have asked other people but they are all too busy
it is a job
i am not asking you to go on holiday with me or anything weird it is for the Observer magazine
so you know do you want to come
this programme contains some strong language
Why are we going so early
because i want to take in Bolton Abbey and then squeeze in
do a breakfast instead of lunch and then quickly say hi to my parents
you do not mind
do you mind coming to say hi
Physically
yes
Actually visit them
i can not leave you in the car
you could bring me a lemonade and a packet of crisps
Leave the window like that so i do not get too hot
and we and we can come
i will bring my parents and your nose is through the gap like that
you say i would bring him in but he might make a mess
from Bolton's old monastic tower
the bells ring loud with gladsome power
the sun shines bright the fields are gay
with people in their best array
of stole and doublet hood and scarf
Along the banks of crystal wharf
and thus in joyous mood they hie
to Bolton's mouldering priory
Sir Ian McKellen
Come we shall walk together
is that why you went to bed early last night so you could learn that poem
yes
Mission accomplished
i do not know why you quote
you weren't interested in Wordsworth before we went on this trip
or Bolton Abbey
this is lovely
this is fantastic
i know it is
i liked Bolton Abbey before you liked Bolton Abbey
Why'd you have to do it in Ian McKellen's voice
what would have been nice is if you'd learnt that poem which i appreciate even thought it was meant to intimidate me if you'd got up this morning and said the poem in your own voice and meant the words
i chose a voice to suit the mood
i felt Sir Ian coming as he does from Bolton would be perfectly suited
it is a different Bolton Rob
yeah all right
it is the same word
i thought he would be perfectly suited for here
and it is incredible
i mean look that is in credible
i am standing on a grave
Sorry
will you be buried or will you be cremated
i think i would i would like to be buried so that i have a headstone like Elvis
Mmm hmm
but i think that when you have a headstone and you are in a place it puts great pressure on your family the surviving family to visit you
I'd be happy if you
if you
i am happy with either
if they buried you or cremated you they would both suit me fine
would you come to my funeral
would you turn up do you think
Course i would
would you
yeah
if only to pad out the numbers you know
you know when you know when um when someone dies and they go to the funeral and they say we should have done this when he was alive
he would have loved this
Mmm
what cremated him
no
you know hearing hearing the eulogies
that is what i will say at your funeral
we should have done this when he was alive
Cremated him
Ha ha ha ha ha
no riposte from you cos you are dead
AS MAN IN a BOX
i do not think you should say that
in a box
you would not be able to come back with your man in a box even though it would be fantastic if you had cos you'd be in a coffin
it would have been the perfect place to do it
i would literally be a man in the box
i know it would have been great
i will be safe in the knowledge that i will go Great i can do that and he won't come back with his man in a box which would have been brilliant but he can not cos he is brown bread
I'd be there
I'd be there
I'd be at your funeral
and now from one of Rob's very closest friends
you will know him of course as TV's Alan Partridge
and he has asked specifically to come up and take 25 30 minutes to talk about his friend Rob
Ladies and gentlemen
S
Shush
Ladies and gentlemen Steve Coogan
oh you may also know Steve from some of his very good Art House films that have been very well reviewed by some of the broadsheet newspapers Steve Coogan
Thanks
Thank you
a ha
Somebody will shout that out one of my Welsh relatives
yes yes
Alan Partridge
Very much alive compared with with our good departed friend Rob Brydon
Rob was an interesting guy
Very funny very entertaining and and yet at the same time there was something that
although he made me laugh and made us all laugh i think there was something about him that was lost something about him that seemed unable to to confront the reality of life
and so when i think of Rob i i think of him with both a smile at some of the funny pithy one liners he would come out with on Radio Four panel shows but also for the man inside because behind every little pithy vaguely amusing joke is a cry for help
but let's not remember him
not gonna finish there are you
Jesus Christ
i won't finish there no
no OK
but but but of course let's not remember a man who has lost desperately trying to legitimise his life by doing silly voices constantly and not confronting the truth let's remember the other side of Rob
the entertainer
the Rob Brydon the entertainer
yes
yes
the Brydon who gave some levity
yes to our life and helped us avoid confronting the harsh realities and helped us avoid looking at the brutal reality of what life is
all right talk about some of the characters
OK
oh
who can forget his Tom Jones impression
who can forget that
AS TOM
Think I'd better die now
you could say that
yes
huh think I'd better die now
that is good
yeah i know
i will take over when you are dead
there will be plenty of
i will do plenty of Tom Jones when you are dead
do not worry about that
Ah why thank you
i am
Ah you are welcome
but there will be affection there
I'd
i would not
i would never stick the knife in
i might just like tickle you with a knife
that is all good sport
Good sport
Exactly
should it go the other way
it is OK
i am not asking you to do that
Let's let's let's move on
Come on
no i am just saying if it did
yeah that is all right
i would be
i do not need to know
I'd rather that it be a mystery
i think if you do die before me it will probably be murder
can you leap can you vault this fence
yes
Go on vault it
Vault that fence now
Wait a minute
Ready
Ah
OK
Wait whoa whoa
Hang on
Watch
Watch me
uh
oh
Bloody hell
are you all right
yep
Whoa do not run it
what
do not run
Why
there will be moss
Fucking hell
Jesus Christ
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
you have got stuck halfway towards your destination
you are stuck in a metaphor
i am not
you will ne
Aw
Ooh
oh fuck
Fuck
Ah
Fuck
it is a metaphor
that is not a metaphor
Fuck
Fuck
you looked at home in the water
i could see you perhaps branching out into more action roles do you know what i mean as opposed to playing the klutz
KlTCHEN CLATTER
do you know what i like this
i like
this is beautiful light
Very nice light this
Like a ski holiday
it is very apres ski
yeah
it feels apres ski
no during ski
Eh
Dure ski
yes
yeah yes a lunch break in the middle of a skiing trip yeah
Good morning gents
Good morning
would you like an orange juice
i will
yes please
but it is nice when you have snow
it makes you look healthy
but this light is not very good for me
what does my skin look like in this light
Well you know it is
it is uneven
it is like the surface of the moon
Fascinating
Scrambled egg no mushrooms
that is me
Look at that
Thank you very much
Enjoy your meals
Thank you
People tell me i have got a
if i have a moan about my skin they say oh but it gives you character
it does
you have got a lot of character
Enough for an episode of Cranford
you are a character actor
it is character
i am a leading man
we have been over this you know
i am Dustin Hoffman
i am a leading man with a character actor's body and face
OK
yeah no that is a fair point
it is a valid point
it is a valid point
i will take it on the chin
which is difficult for me but easy for you
could land a plane on mine
yeah
Wwwrrrrhhh
Wwwrrrhhh
Mmm
a small chin enables you to do it with women very well
how come you have left your black pudding
i do not dislike it but i am never i am never sure about it
i just naturally do not go to it
it is cos there is a risk involved
it is a taboo
Mmm
Mmm
Mwah ha ha
this is just really glorious
it is a sunny day in England with a fried breakfast
it doesn't get much better
this is nice
but if i am being very honest with you
i am looking forward to being home now
Mate you and me both
the most important thing to me is that i have that my children are healthy
oh yeah i mean that that i am healthy so i can be there for them
that is more important than any work any award
and puts everything in perspective
You'd throw away all your awards
I'd throw them in a river
if you could exchange them for knowing your children would live a happy life
i would happily throw all my awards in a river
not the sea
Corrosion
no but if i threw them in a river if push came to shove i could hire a team of scuba divers to retrieve them
but you know the gesture's the important thing family's more important
no family's more important
of course it is
if it was a choice between winning an award and my child being healthy
yeah
i would absolutely you know throw them all
yeah
other way around
what if
if you were to allow your child to have an illness right you could win
Say a BAFTA you could have a film BAFTA if
no of course not
an illness the child would recover from but would have some discomfort
no
that is a disgusting idea
Let me up the stakes
Oscar Best Actor
Eh Best Actor Steve Coogan
what to have an ill child
of course not
Well well hang on well
not not a
what kind of illness
Appendicitis
what you mean
so they get oh my stomach
where is Dad
oh he is on location
it is really hurting
Really hurting
Argh
Doctor comes in off to hospital bang bang oh i am weak then they are better
meanwhile Academy Award Winner Steve Coogan
Well
Well now we now we glimpse the real man
what do you mean
i am just thinking it through
i think the answer's probably i still would not probably
Very nice
yeah

all finished gents
Ah yes
Perfect

L'addition s'll vous plait

Look
Doctor
Dr Fadigati
how are you
i wanted to see you
Come i need an advisor but not a medical one
does it bother you
no
is not it beautiful
is not it by far the most beautiful
yes certainly
the trouble is that someone has already purchased it
i am the buyer
are you angry with me for that
so much
the other day my father fell in love with it
how is he
he moves from his chair to his bed and from his bed to his chair
Excuse me
Miss Nora
this table is now yours
Send my greetings to your father
Thank you
Good evening
Good evening
Doctor would you like to play Bridge
my husband loses every game
i am a lousy player
Liar
Whatever you do you do it well
another time
hello Doctor
i pass
Same
can i come in
no do not turn it off
her voice is divine
how wonderful
it is sublime
and your game
i just left
i only enjoy it when i win
but with my husband we are a losing couple
there he is
i win
this morning too
is it the doctor
okay you won
every Tuesday and Friday
Always alone
Three sausages and ham
two sausages and three slices smoked bacon
Hurry up
do not spend all of it
September sausages twelve hams and four smoked bacon
do you hear them
Professor
they think that those who yell are always right
all this is depressing
what will become of me without you
Continue to work as if nothing had happened
you will get along very well with Maldolezzi
this will be the same again
nothing will ever be as before
Jews out
more Jews in the universities
Jews out of college
we do not want to believe your resignation
it must
i signed it
where will you go
to Ferrara
in the ghetto
Yet
his tonsils are in perfect condition
can i leave
Provided that you tell me Goodbye Doctor
the consultation is over
Your daughter did nothing
i will see you out
i forgot to tell you
i bought a villa
i intend to make it a gem and nobody has as much taste as you
you overestimate me
if you were kind enough to provide your advice i will bring you there
it would be a pleasure
but you see half Ferrara's got a sore throat
Doctor
do not neglect me
i can be very cruel
but not with me i hope
See you soon
hello David
David
how are you
Good
and your father
he sleeps
i wonder every time if he wakes up
he can no longer speak
he follows me with his eyes without saying a word
and my poor grandmother she doesn't understand that her son will die before her
i can not stand the smell of carbolic acid
Tell me something cheerful
University
Professor Peruggi had to resign
Somehow my father was lucky
he won't see what will happen
i have something to show you
you will see this is the story of our family
everything is there
it was he who wrote it
one page per day
Ancestors poverty wealth
Life in the ghetto
Holidays at Villa Trevi
Listen
Today in our house in Ferrara
our first daughter was born which i named Eleonora
a beautiful child very healthy
God has been very generous
October 2nd 1916
Why did not he name me Judith
or Esther
or Sarah
he had foresight Dad
Yet i have no Aryan profile
Really
he wanted so much to have a son
the day my father dies the Trevi family comes to an end
i am afraid David
Berlin
the government has taken tough measures against Jewish capitalists accused of sabotaging the national economy
the Jewish world protested
Also in Italy
Why did you turn it off
i want to listen to that
you think you can calm me down by switching that off
Calm you down about what
Italy is not Germany
Certain things do not happen here
at what time will you come home
Please excuse my delay
Please excuse my delay
Thank you
have you listened the radio
Hitler ordered that the German Jews have to pay a new tax
for him it is compensation
to me this is racketeering
i want to eat in peace
Italy will take the same measures
i know what you say Italy is not Germany
but this is false
it will happen here soon
Traditionally Italy is not anti Semitic
the university had five Jewish professors
now zero
they did this to keep Hitler calm
but i feel sorry for Professor Peruggi
he is from Ferrara
a man of great value
he has three children next month he has no income
that is polemic
it is not my fault
Your optimism
Enough
the debate is over
Excuse me i am not hungry
i have to go
i do not understand this guy
how dare you
Dad always says that
you are right
how do the young people say
i need to change discs
anyway i am convinced that common sense will prevail
Heraldo
Come on it is six o'clock
you have to pay your registration fee for university
i will pay today
and then i am broke
it is nearly the end of the month
you are losing a button
Mom
i will miss the train
i will report to you tonight
this is for you
are these your secret savings
now the vault is empty
Bye
be careful
will you think of me
Hurry
Hands high
Victoria doesn't complain
she is got a low butt
Molon
i bet 5 lire that the Dr Fadigati will take our train
you are kidding
for 10 lire i will tell you why he goes to Bologna
what
nothing pedal
we always have to wait
i go there but it is the last time
i am really tired
it must be a pear
i summarize five hams two sausages and cheese
Miss
Dr
can i help you
Let go i will take care of it
Why
because i said so
Look
Thank you doctor
it is really nice doctor
Bravo Doctor
Thank you doctor
it is really nice
Let's eat
for you
and for you nothing
it is better on these wooden benches than on dusty pads
the fare is half price and it is twice as fun
you are commuting
twice a week
Tuesday and Friday
i teach at the university but when i was a student i often commuted
i lived in Venice and studied at Padua
you want one
i do not smoke
Cigarette
Why do not you go to the concerts anymore
i have a lot of things to do
the contemporary literature courses exhaust me
by the way
Fire
Please continue
for a long time i was undecided between medicine and literature
Life is strange
i think i was mistaken about my calling
you earn money
do you remember me
Sure
you are a Lavezzolli
the child with rhinitis
Am i wrong
and you are the older brother
you suffered from epistaxis is that correct
i was bleeding from the nose
and me doctor
you nothing
but i remember you
Why
because you are charming
Thank you
i will be late
Goodbye
he is in a hurry
he is afraid to lose it
what
his position at the faculty
as for me i can see it clearly
he will meet a woman
or a man
you are so stupid
Come and see
Dou you have a light
Perhaps Heraldo is right
he just lights his cigarette
the doctor doesn't smoke
Why does he carry matches
to be of service
Let's follow him to see where he goes
Why
what do you care
the girl is in love with the doctor
David
Good evening
what a nice surprise
so many books
if you have the time we could go to the bar
Talking with you is always interesting
not tonight
i have to deliver all these books
another time
of course
Good evening
David
Come on
Welcome
Children this young man is the son of Bruno Lattes
Grammar history math and latin
Thank you
Thank you from my heart
and if you stay with us
Actually
i need an assistant
Take my place
Want to become a teacher
and a writer
so tonight you start
here in front of you
Why not
Tell them what it means to write to teach to have a passion for books
they will listen
they are open
be their mentor
a bit of guts
you are in the situation of an exam
how to begin
Go ahead try
Why read and why write
it is not easy to explain
one of my favorite poets wrote a letter to a great writer
his name was Francesco Petrarca and the writer Boccaccio
i do not remember exactly the letter but basically it said
there is nothing as light as a feather and there is nothing more beautiful than words
someone writes a story and in ten centuries people will still read and love it
we live in a time of persecution of violence and war
but when i read a poem of Petrarch i feel
the celebration of life because he loved life
he loved his job
i recall the last words of his letter
since i must die
i hope death will come to me
while being busy with reading or writing
Jew stop it
we will chat a little
Wait
Leave him alone he is a friend
you are too many
do not you think
you are brave
a show off that is all
Sit next to me
i am late
hello young people
it will be cold now
the minestrone is better cold refined with a drizzle of olive oil
you are not having the appetizer
he is on a diet
on diet
he
it is me who should be on diet
it is for his weight
his weight you understand
of course boxing
Why boxing
you do not like boxing
Frankly no
Perhaps because it is the sport of the poor
Heraldo is a champion
i meant
Leave it there
it is better
no
Let's hear it
the doctor may have interesting things to tell
no nothing of interest
it is just old stuff
i know
Boxing causes considerable trauma brain damage
is that what you meant
it well is the backdrop of my thinking
Continue to eat your soup
Doctor you are my guest
the woman or Miss who will pay for my meal hasn't been born yet
Accept or i will hurt myself
on one condition
you pay my bill and all the others are my guests
no objection
of course
Doctor look
a boxer who smokes
you do not scold him
i don' smoke but i have some matches on me
they can always come in handy
Doctor have you ever seen a boxing match
it is not a brutal sport it is just a matter of style
it is about flexibility and skill
about footwork
that is why it is called the noble art
Pass me the wine please
what do you know about boxing
the doctor is right
the punches hurt
you have never given or received any
the ring requires men to know each other without the need to talk
if i have ever known someone close it is in the ring
there they fight without mercy
and then hug
Thank you very much
Goodbye
Doctor
you forgot something
i do not think so
Thank you
i have a fight on Wednesday night
you should come
you just defined Six qualitites an author must have as the birth of contemporary theater
a disruption of theatrical forms
everything before Pirandello can be burned then
the books do not have to be burned although it happens sometimes
Your booklet
half past six
no
you have marked my exam or my family name
if you are not content you may try the next round
no
18 is perfectly fine with me and you judge it as i do
how long have you been waiting
Maybe an hour
they put you on the fifth
30 and honors
no
18
18
it is already a lot
Forget about it
if it had happened to me you would have told me
you are lucky
in Germany you would have been already arrested
it never happened to me
Irrelevant i will get used to it
30
i have got 30
Let's celebrate
where do you take me
it is a surprise
Come
how did you know i need you
i love you
i love you
you never said that to me
i always say it
no need for words
Imagine that dialogue otherwise
i love you
i love you too
i love you very much
i love you more
so many things happened today
when did you make the decision
i have been waiting for this moment for so long
and you always evaded it
as if our first would be the last
in some aspects you seem twice your age
and sometimes not even half
Why is it today that i wanted to make love
Why here
Why not
Why did i say i love you
because it is the truth
it is the simple truth
you are a liar
Want to know about my plans
Tomorrow
i must go
i have to go to France
there are urgent matters to look after
but on my return will bring you here and thou shalt be my prisoner
Thank you
Surprised
i said thank you
my vocabulary has expanded
that is not for the car
it is for another thing
These are my first holidays
Well i heard your wish
you have always went to to Ferrara for vacation
yes
every summer in Ferrara
every year
Long walks strolls under the arcades
and sometimes a movie
and girls
Heaps
for this you do not need money
and in September the friends who talk about their memories from holiday
Lots of adventures
i do not know why i call them friends
i always hated them
Why
some are friendly
Bianca
David
yes i agree
but David talks too much
he looks like you
Apart from boxing what are you interested in
to have a real life
at any rate a better one
i am sick of Ferrara Italy
i want a fresh start
i am listening to you and i hear your father
what do you know about my father
i got to know him before he left
for him too Ferrara was stifling
he was a little bit crazy but a good man
a bastard
at first he sent us money from America and then one day nothing
not even a letter
nothing
my mother was forced to manage the household for more than 12 years
you want to smoke
Try it
you do not even know how to smoke
Give me that
Carlotta
when did you arrive
i have big news
what
i broke up with Gianni
Haven't you been with Gilberto
who is Gianni
you are still with Gilberto
this summer i am free
you know what that means
that means you are looking for a new boyfriend
Exactly
or i retire and enter a convent
Carlotta
Ciao
you have arrived
how are you
Attention
what are you doing
i am looking for you
he told me i am beautiful
Mom
Finally it was you who had them
Let's see
here they are
they are cute
Today the newlyweds are well behaved
we do not plunge
Just longing looks
Myriam
Want to see
no thank you
he got muscles this young man
and one of those strokes of the oar
you won't believe me
last year a girl committed suicide because of Heraldo
he is young
he still has time to find the right path
Whereas Fadigati amazes me
a little discretion at least
not in front of everyone
Look around you
the beach is full of
Ferrare people digusted and outraged
that circus gives me the scabies
they are far off
you need binoculars to see them
so i am wrong
this is not what i mean
this man feels rather embarassed
Shame
you talk nonsense
before he was ashamed
now he no longer has any shame
in Ferrara he was always discreet
that did not stop the gossip
People were shocked
Too bad
he is a handsome man
you simply would not see it
but daring to lug this this boy here to Ferrara for all to see is what counts
and according to you i am wrong
i did not say that
and their room is above mine
Sorry i understand
it really must be unpleasant
in Rome guys like Fadigati are being sent to the mines of Sardinia
Coal mines
how stupid
all these beautiful young shirtless men
Cte d'Azur
Nora
and the stamp is for me
we will be late
i get off
Look who is coming
Coldness
Pretend to know nothing
here they are
my two beautiful twins
how are you
where do we go
with my convertible we will go where you want
Make yourself at home
David come here for two seconds
we haven't seen each other anymore
i have seen you
you too
at the end of the telescope
do not confuse me with certain people
but you and the doctor know that half Ferrara goes here
he is not to blame
it was me who decided to come here
Why not
you all come here
so i decided to add a little atmosphere to the holidays of my fellow citizens
the beach is beautiful and the people are nice
i like being noticed and looked at
but i especially want to have fun
you not
Come
you see those two idiots
you like them
they are older
they are from Parma
they are twins
one for you one for me
Afterwards we swap them
you think so
i must leave you
i wait for the treasure hunt
a treasure hunt
the twins are worth more
See you
Girls i am all yours
Ready to Run
i am ready
Heraldo swear that you do not go too fast
Go
this must be a very difficult letter
Forgive me i am indiscreet
Please
Today i would not go beyond the first line
Beware i am a Nosy Parker
you did not know
Writing a beautiful love letter is very difficult
you think
Maybe mine was just a business letter
you know why it is so difficult
it is because of the fear to leave superficial and unnecessary words to posterity
Love is not eternal
so we want to fix it by writing for future generations
have you ever written such a letter
Excuse me i am indiscreet
Your question is friendly and sincere
to your misfortune you are extremely sensitive
you smoke
if i wrote a love letter this probably would not be very uplifting reading
i am not talking about its content
it would certainly be more than that
Personally i am not ashamed of anything
but
past a certain age
love begins to become pathetic
you smoke again
if i smoke'again'
i never smoked before
nothing to do
i do not get it
how do you make rings of smoke
Smoking is a stupid vice i admit
but it is partly through this practice that i fill my cabinet
Today i haven't had breakfast
i will end up without dinner
a sandwich will suffice
i do not like to be alone at the table
he is never there
i am all alone
he wants to have fun
this is his first vacation
you see i am getting ridiculous
not pathetic just ridiculous
however i will respond
i will go and write a nice letter
is not that a good idea
it will be better than mine and you will be wasting less paper
i feel great
at twenty every word is an appeal is irresistible a cry of love and innocence
but what is a love letter at my age
a message in a bottle in the sea
to you
Everybody get in the water
we take off the swimsuits
can i kiss give you a kiss on the forehead
Bruno when did you arrive
Just now
i am exhausted
the heat in Ferrara
and David
over there
i bet Ms Lavezolli wants to play bridge and is in need for a victim
so i sneak away
she always wants to win
Mr Lattes
do you play bridge
Caught on the fly
hello David
you brought the bad weather
i have a bad reputation
my husband and i against the father and his son
it is not possible i have a terrible headache
you want an aspirin
Thank you
i gladly accept
Doctor what a pleasant surprise
a delightful surprise
i go to the bar
Tesoro we are waiting for you
Better not
you proposed to me to be your partner
this is an opportunity
i already have David as a partner
Opponent then
Perfect opponent
i haven't played for years
we are gonna lose
that is for sure
Three clubs
i pass
Four clubs
i pass
Six clubs
Well
Lucky at cards unlucky in love
Excuse me we are not talking during a game
i speak when i want
they will take a good bath
Just luck
we haven't seen your friend
he left
no
King
it would make sense
such a beautiful boy with such an athletic body
he must be busy
Doctor where do you go
Let him go
how naive you are Mr Lattes
you are the only one who doesn't realise what happens
Poor man
Good evening David
Nora
i wrote a hundred letters but i haven't had the courage to send them
Let me see you
you are beautiful
you received my postcard
yes
you did not say much
at least i have sent one
you have written hundreds of them to put them in the wastebasket
there are news
i spoke with the housekeeper
she told me about your problems
she is wrong
my business is doing well
i assure you everything is fine
i found a very rich partner
and i have received two proposals of marriage
Interesting
and you
i have not yet responded
i will teach you a new dancing step
we do not dance it on the Riviera
one hand here and the other one there
do you like it
it is you that i like
i missed you too
i do not want to dance
Good evening
without a partner
i will find one
Sit down
what would you like to have
Melba tutti frutti
Sir
nothing
he beefed up but he is still handsome
Arrogant
Courageous
the only fascist capable of standing up to Mussolini
he is also intelligent and generous
it looks like you praise him too much
and you are not you a bit overly suspicious of him
this man doesn't care about the racial laws
he is a friend of the Jews
he was a friend of your father
and mine too
Look they are talking about you
do not you feel flattered
no not flattered
Rather satisfied
not all of them intend to cut off our heads
there are still some who offer to give us a hand
who is this young man speaking with the Grand Duke
they team up
in Abyssinia they gave him a golden medal for military service
his father is a tycoon in industry
they keep their business in the family
Dad makes the bullets his son shoots with
how do you know all this
and you why do not you know anything
hello Doctor
you are late too
will you grant me the honor to bear you company
Thank you but
we are waiting for friends at our table
Excuse us
a brandy please
we could've invite him
yes we could have
so why
Myriam
you do it on purpose
do you want to dance
no thank you
i feel tired
Poor Fadigati
Look at him
Always alone
shall we invite him
can not we stay alone just the two of us
Excuse me
his excellency has the honor to invite lady Eleonora to his table
Gladly
Thank you
i can not refuse the offer
those who still give us a hand
Moron
Excuse me
i am sorry
how exciting
to be a pilot it must be sublime divine
the bike is exciting too
the pedal is nice non
will you dance with me or offer a gigantic cup of ice cream
Dancing cost me less
i am Jewish after all
Heraldo where have you been
Your behaviour is intolerable
do not talk to me like that
do not bother me
Heraldo listen to me
i told you to leave me alone
you can not treat me like that
Let me go
my glasses
my glasses
they are broken
do not worry
we will fix them
Why do not you just let him tumble
Leave me alone and also live him alone
this winter we have many things to talk about in Ferrara
Dear colleague we have fixed the cheekbone
but as for your glasses you need to buy a new pair
what can i give you
here it will do you good
how did this happen
he stumbled
he stumbled
I'd rather avoid them
Come with me
the clothes the watch the money
he hasn't forgotten nothing
but why
Why
we always shared everything
there is no need to behave like that
the punches the scandal it is nothing compared to the rest
i am giving a bad performance of myself tonight
and i am going to lose your friendship
what are you going to do
Return to Ferrara
do you need money
i had my wallet on me
at least he did not steal it
and if you go the police
the police
you think it is possible
Bon Voyage doctor
so did you like it
Very much
the orchestra was wonderful
and you haven't seen everything
where are we going
you will see
David
i wanted to say goodbye
Tomorrow i am leaving
i beg your pardon i was not very nice to you
it is no big deal
it is not always easy to put up with me
Too bad that i am only Carlotta
Wait Carlotta
Thank you
and for what
i do not know
so
for weeks i have been looking for you
i am totally confused
i thought you wanted to hide or leave Ferrara without saying goodbye
you would not do that right
Why not
David war is inevitable
i must react
to face death you need a good reason
i have none
you had one
my father is dead
Nora
i can not hide it any longer
i will be baptized
Facing great tragedy one is a hero or a coward
i do not want to die
i do not want to see you anymore
Leave me alone
i told you leave me alone
the two of us it no longer has any meaning
it means nothing
Let me please
David please
you will be baptised you will raise a Catholic son and you will live with this man whose chest is full of medals
you think it will be that easy for you
to survive is not a privilege
it is a basic right to all of us
Fear
Fear has turned you into a pathetic coward a poor fool
Come here you bastard
Stop
Excuse me
where can i find Dr Fadigati
he came for 2 or 3 days and then he disappeared
Come back tomorrow and ask the management
Make up your mind
this is the third streetlight
you want to clean up all this
See you
Godspeed
what
Want to have a little chat
what do you want to talk about
Come here
you are nice
what happened to you
you want me to follow you
you are demanding
Slowly please
i am not young anymore
Dr Fadigati
Wait
Bravo
Spying on me huh
when a man adopts a dog it is a normal thing
but when a dog adopts the man it is embarrassing
she wants to adopt me
what do you want me to do
i will let her do it
i have looked everywhere for you
at home the office the hospital
what happened
i thought i was not presentable
how is your father
Good
but where have you been
Why do not we go to my place
i am sorry it is getting late
it was a great pleasure to see you again
may i accompany you
do not bother my home is far
you live so far away
Please let me
Doctor wait
Remember one day you told me i am a busybody
Surely you were talking about a contagious disease
Hurry up beauty
there is only a bit of wine left
Generally it is good
but i hope it did not turn into vinegar yet
Drinking it is the only way to find out
to my new home
this furniture these paintings where am i going to put them
i have only this room the kitchen a bathroom and a room with a view on a ridiculous yard
Want to see it
there is nothing to see
he left for France
there are people who only belong to themselves
that is what they believe
my God what a mess
do you know how many customers i lost
where the heck did i put it
i have already left the clinic
i started to refrain from the hospital
Soon nobody will remember me
this will force me to move to another town
i offer this
to me
you remember that night at the sea
you wrote a letter
i tried to write one
i also tried to write this evening
i tried for two hours
not really a letter
it was almost a a last will
the testament of a man who has no intention to die but that person needed to support his life did not arrive
i knew that i was becoming cumbersome
i do not even know what i am saying
i have been rambling for a long time already
i talk to myself
this little dog is comforting me a lot
my long monologues become dialogues with her
that is wonderful thank you
18th century Venetian school
i do not know why but this picture makes me think of you when you are moody
there are too many things
i will be forced to sell at least half of it
you can go if you want
i remind you that it is you who came looking for me
I'd like to take a walk with you
on one of the next days if you have nothing else to do
we can take the bus to go to Ponte Lagoscuro
Saturday if it suits you
of course only if it doesn't rain
if it doesn't rain
at this place the river is very beautiful when there is a flood
you need something
no nothing
Come i will see you out
this place really is a labyrinth
you are so nice
you care about my little problems
and i have not asked a word about what happened to your family
Yet the only friends i have ever had were Jews you know
Loneliness
Fear
and today i have only one friend
on Saturday if it doesn't rain
Promised
and thank you again
Hopefully it will be fine
that was Dr Fadigati on the phone
he did not want to bother you while you were eating
but wanted to remind you of Lagoscuro Ponte
Elena be nice please go to your room and wait for my call
David
i want you to be careful
you know our situation
what do you mean by careful
Racial segregation started
i can well see it down in the shop
or Elena at school
she mentioned it to me
Please
at least do it for me
for us
this man doesn't see it
Too early
Patience
Let's go back to our place
we will have a snack at home
i understood
Vampa
where have you been
i have been looking for you everywhere
we will do a little race
Come on
Dr Fadigati
yes that is me
See how it rains
Even the weather is against me
so much rain it ruins our plan
not necessarily
Maybe it will clear off
Believe me my dear friend there is no hope anymore
no hope anymore
this is only a postponement
there is still time
the river's always been there
Noone has taken it away
you do not happen to know but my little dog well she is gone
we took a walk down the street as usual when a man called her by her name
Vampa
she was called Vampa
before i left she looked me in the face with an expression
i am sorry to forsake you like this old man
but i must return to my young owner
Forgive me but i have to do this
Goodbye my dear friend
Take care
all the best
you decide
yes or no
Nora died during childbirth in 1940
Heraldo tried a career in France as a professional boxer without success
David became a writer well known all over the world 151 Jews of Ferrara were deported to the campsCar names are so stupid are not they
no baron has ever owned a LeBaron
or the Ford LTD
LTD
Limited
it is a limited edition
what did they make 50 million of those
yes it is limited to the number we can sell
or when they try and mangle a positive word into a car name
you know how they will do that
the Integra
oh integrity
no Integra
the Supra or the lmpreza
yeah
Well i hope it is not a lemona
or you will be hearing from my lawya
so George you sure i can not show you any other cars
i do not think so Vic
Done my homework
' 89 Volvo
that is the car for me
it is the one i want
i got a LeBaron convertible right here
N i not interested
got a few more miles on it but the previous owner was Jon Voight
Jon Voight
okay Tim you are welcome
was that Tim Whatley
yes it was
he wanted your address
you friend will be invited to his night before Thanksgiving party
he is got that great apartment on 77th Street and they overlook where they inflate those huge balloons for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
i have always had a big crush on Tim
Why can not he ask me out
he is a dentist
you do not wanna go out with a dentist
Why
he will always be criticising your brushing technique
it will drive you crazy
Away from the gums
New car
Hey
Did you get the Volvo
no i decided to go with an'89 LeBaron
a LeBaron
i thought Consumer said Volvo was the car
what consumer
i am the consumer
Seems like a strange choice
Well maybe so
but it was good enough for Mr Jon Voight
Jon Voight
the actor
that is right
he just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle
you bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight
no
no
i think yes yes
you like the idea of telling people you are driving Jon Voight's car
all right maybe i do
so what
i have never even seen him in a car
i mean look at his movies
no cars
De iverance canoe
Midnight Cowboy boots
Runaway Train runaway train
Hey
Jerry you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block
if they do not get business they will shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores
i like coffee
i like cookies
Well of course you do
and you know why
because you are a bunch of yuppies
it is your go go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these mom and pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighbourhood
Well what is so great about a mom and pop store
Let me tell you if my mom and pop ran a store i would not shop there
Hey Bucambo they have been in the neighbourhood for 48 years
now come on Jerry you gotta have shoes in need of a cobbler
i really do not wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled
Well what about sneakers
they will clean them
do complete detailing
all right
Take them
yeah yeah
Kramer without you we'd be out of business
These belong to my neighbour Jerry Seinfeld the comedian
so many sneakers
Well he is got a Peter Pan complex
they will be ready a week from Thursday
oh well no rush
what is the matter
i keep getting these nosebleeds
Lie down
and put your head back
oh yeah
Hey what is with your ceiling
what
you got wires sticking out every which way
it looks dangerous
you should call an electrician
you know in the 48 years we have been here i do not think we have ever called an electrician
Well you should
this place could blow any minute
Elaine
yes Mr Pitt
have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet
no
i am still working on it
what in blazes are you listening to
Artie Shaw Honeysuckle Jump
that was Artie Shaw Honeysuck e Jump
Elaine how did you know that
oh my father used to have a huge collection of big band records
Congratu ations to Wayne Hopper for identifying it
by doing so he becomes our seventh person to man the Woody Woodpeck er ba oon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
there are on y three spots eft
when we come back you' have three more chances to win a spot ho ding a rope under Woody Woodpeck er
could you identify the next song
could you
could you
Why would you wanna hold the ropes from the Woody Woodpecker balloon
my father was a stern man
he forbade us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man
the Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list
all right
okay
i will do the best i can
here we go for the next spot under the ba oon
if you know the name of this next song ca 555 B AND
Elaine
do you know it
what song is it
will you shut up
i can not hear
i am sorry
oh i have got it
it is next Stop Pottersville
Goody
yes yes yes
next Stop Pottersville
you are a genius
you will love this car even if you do not like Jon Voight
i like Jon Voight
it is a strange reason to buy a car because he might have driven it
what do you mean might
you do not think he really owned it
i do not know
Why would the guy make up something like that
of the names he could pick why settle on Jon Voight
do not you see that is the genius of it
if he had said Liam Neeson you'd know he is making it up
Liam Neeson
how are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight
Jerry we are talking about Joe Buck
if you can play Joe Buck Oskar Schindler's a cakewalk
oh look at this
i stepped in gum
you are not getting in my car with gummy shoes
all right
i will change my shoes
Liam Neeson
you know he is not American
Let me get a clean pair
Everybody's ta king at me
i can not hear a word they are saying
Just driving round in Jon Voight's car
Kramer
Hey where is all my sneakers
you said take them
not all of them
Well obviously there was a miscommunication
Obviously
so what am i supposed to wear
Jerry i left you a pair right here
where
Come on
you are not looking
here
there
Put on those boots
i can not wear these
Well why not
they are uncomfortable
Come on here
Try them on
where did you get those
i worked a club in Dallas once and they could not pay me so they gave me these
i can not wear these
they look ridiculous
you look like a cowboy
i do not wanna be a cowboy
oh stop it
you know Tim the dentist
i got an invitation to his Thanksgiving eve party
yeah
i got one too
oh yeah
what
no
nothing
no what is it
no it is just that i did not get one
you did not get one
but he called me up and asked for yours and Elaine's addresses
i am sure that means i am invited
not necessarily
Why would you call someone for addresses if you are not invited to the party
that is the genius of it
i am calling Elaine
See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley
Hey i got Jon Voight's LeBaron
Boss
Four thousand dollars
we can not afford that
Well you have to do something about it because it is in violation of the building code
otherwise they are gonna close you up
Supposing we can not pay for it
then i have to report you
otherwise i lose my license
Sorry
Forty eight years Mom
and now we have to close
all because of that idiot and his bloody nose
Afternoon Mom
Afternoon Pop
you know you got a crack in the sidewalk
you ought to get that fixed
so
Come on put the top up
it is November
i feel alive Jerry
Let's check out the glove box
Pencil
Hey you do not think
Sure
that is Jon Voight's pencil
with Jon Voight's teeth marks
Owner's manual
you know what
this car was owned by Jon Voight
you see
i told you
Except Jon is spelled with an H
J O H N
so
Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J O N
so what are you saying
nothing
i am sure Jon probably misspelled his own name
i know sometimes i spell Jerry with a G
and an i
Get out of the car
what
that is right you heard me
Get out
you are ruining this whole experience
oh look
there is Gregory Peck's bicycle
Get out
and Barbara Mandrell's skateboard
Get out
Hey cowboy
where is your horse
yeah you better run
Did they take anything
they did not touch me
i tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots
Well anyway again i am sorry about throwing you out of the car
you really seemed to enjoy it
it was kind of fun
you know maybe his name really is J O H N but he changed it to J O N for show business
Well you know J O N is a lot zippier
yeah that is possible
how would you find out something like that
Wait a minute
what am i thinking
i have got the entire Yankee organisation at my disposal
he will dispose of it
that is right
See you later
so Jerome i did a little snooping around for you
what did you find out Lois
Well i talked to Tim Whatley
yeah
and i asked him should Jerry bring anything
Subtle
and he said Why would Jerry bring anything
all right but let me ask you this
which word did he emphasise
Did he say Why would Jerry bring anything
or Why would Jerry bring anything
Did he emphasise Jerry or bring
i think he emphasised would
you know what
the hell with his party
i do not wanna go to begin with
Hey
Hey
so where is my sneakers
that is what i wanna know
what do you mean
i saw Mom and Pop this morning but when i went by the store on my way home the place was empty
everything is gone
Mom and Pop vanished
so all my sneakers are gone
i am afraid so
and that is just the tip of the iceberg
i have been asking around
they did not even have any kids
Mom and Pop are not even a mom and pop
it was all an act Jerry
they conned us and they scored bigtime
so Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighbourhood establish trust for 48 years and then run off with Jerry's sneakers
Apparently
all right
that is enough of this
where you going
i gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr Pitt's security pass for the parade
Why does he wanna hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade
he finds his laugh intoxicating
so George what kind of promotional events are we talking about
Well i think we need more special days at the stadium
you know like Joe Pepitone Day or Jon Voight Day
Jon Voight
the actor
i make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza
i suppose if i had suggested Liam Neeson Day you'd all be patting me on the back
i guessed Stan Herman's Boomtown Blues
what did you guess
it was next Stop Pottersville
Everybody knows that
you know when they are giving out the passes
after the music
oh man
Taxi
Taxi
Hey
Jon Voight
Jon Voight
Hey listen
can i ask you something
Listen
do you
Wait
no Jon Voight Day huh
no
now i will always have this doubt about the car
what your jaw still hurts
yeah it is all swollen
i think i chipped a tooth when i fell yesterday
have somebody look at it
i am calling dentists all day
Nobody works day before Thanksgiving
you going to the party
no
i do not know if i am invited
there will be lots of dentists there
yeah you are right
you do not wanna suffer all weekend
yeah i gotta see a dentist
this is killing me
Well i will take a chance
we will go together
Maybe i will just meet you there
you do not wanna go with me
Jerry for all i know this guy went out his way to not invite you
how am i gonna feel if i show up with an uninvited unwelcome intruder
the way i feel when i go places with you
Hey
Hey
Did you find my sneakers yet
no
but i ran into somebody you might be interested in
a Mr Jon Voight the actor
Jon Voight are you kidding me
Did you talk to him
he was a little standoffish
what you did not ask him about the car
i could not
his cab pulled away
but he did make an impression on me
Look
what
his tooth marks
he bit me
Jon Voight bit you
what is he a vampire
no it is justifiable
he thought i was going for his wallet
he left perfect imprints
that he did
you have got that pencil with the bite marks on it
we get a trained eye to match them and we will see if you are driving his car
oh please
Wait a minute
Wait it is not that stupid
no it is stupid
Why
Why is it impossible
i mean they are both bite marks
you are showing up at that party with a chewed up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm
it is worth a shot
yeah
Kramer you wanna go to the party together
Jerry look come on i am an invited guest
i can not be aiding and abetting some party crasher
Excuse me dentist
Dentist
Dentist
are you a dentist
are you a dentist
These are the balloons
Big deal
all i see is Woody Woodpecker
you got a problem with Woody Woodpecker
yeah
what is he some sort of an instigator
that is right
he is a troublemaker
Hey did you get my message
what
i can not hear a word you are saying
i was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day
my head is still ringing
where is Tim
what is that
Empire State Building
what
i can not hear you
Elaine would you marry me
Wh
i told you i can not hear a word
all right
Forget it
Hey Tim how you doing
George
Kramer how you doing
Watch
Watch the arm
Listen we do not wanna bother you
we know you are busy
no it is okay what is it
Let me show you something
Take a look
i am gonna get going
Let me take down your number
Great
Hey is that Jerry Seinfeld
he did not come with us
Tim the pencil
Jerry
Hey Tim
Jerry
i did not think you'd show
Did you say Jerry i did not think you'd show or Jerry i did not think you'd show
Elaine hi
Tim
i am really glad you came
what
i am really glad you came
Listen Elaine i have been wanting to ask you would you like to go out with me New Year's Eve
Thanks
what
what
Let me ask you something
could you tell if teeth marks on somebody's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil
it is possible
Roll up your sleeve
Somebody bit you
Well not just someone
Jon Voight
Jon Voight bit you
yeah yeah
the pencil
Get the pencil out of your mouth
you are destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks
that is Jon Voight's pencil
that is right
and i got his whole car downstairs
are you the one you bought his LeBaron convertible
yes
yes
yes
yes i am the one
so you know Jon Voight
yes
i went to dental school with him
Jon Voight the actor
no
the periodontist
can not this wait until Monday
Come by my office
Just a quick peek
i am in agony
all right
Sit down
it is this one here in the back
you popped Woody Woodpecker
Hey who invited you anyway
you are a troublemaker
Looks ik e Woody Woodpeck er is running out of air
in fact he is co apsing
those kids look pretty disappointed
Especially that big kid up in the front
how old is he
hello
he o is this Jerry Seinfe d
yes it is
you do not know me but a really strange thing happened
i was at a garage sale and this old couple sold me used sneakers they claim belonged to Jerry Seinfeld the comedian
could i have the address to that garage sale
okay thank you very much
i found Mom and Pop
they are selling my sneakers
where are they
Parsippany New Jersey
Let's go
my car's in the shop
how are we getting to Parsippany
Jerry these nosebleeds are starting again
Maybe we should get you to a hospital
i ain't going to no Bellevue
Look at me i am falling apart here
the marching band is a perfect example of taking something bad and making it difficult too
i mean why does the band have to march
we are not moving
Maybe if they hold still we could all leave
is that why they do it
People try and get away
no you do not
i am right with you
Right with you buddy
the human urge to wave at total strangers just moving by is very strong is not it
Parades and ocean liners and those little trains that go through amusement parks
it is always that bittersweet kind of hello goodbye combination wave is not it
Just
i have never seen these people before in my life and they are leaving

do not forget to say it when the Super comes
he will be very happy to hear that
Operation Boar Hunt was carefully planned
you were told to go in and make the arrest
you almost let the prime suspect get away
what happened
did not he give you clear orders
yes but he said the operation was very well planned
what
this operation was carefully planned
but it had a few flaws
Why were there flaws
that is because Ka kui could not handle the woman
before we even got to the store they heard her screaming
how did Chu Tu get through your men then
what do you mean by that
do not point your fingers at each other
what
the PR lady is here
Let her in
the press is here Superintendent
Tell them no comment
Hold it
i asked them to come
then tell them to wait
Ka kui you will be our spokesman
me
i can not possibly
the speech is ready just read it
Learn your lines
you can go now and do not botch them
the Chief is well pleased with Ka kui's performance
a promising lad
after the speech take him to do a police recruitment poster
and arrange for him to appear on TV
a role model
the Chief thinks he is a model policeman
he will be really good for it
what are the charges on Salina
Drug dealing resisting arrest and assaulting police officers
Drop all the charges
Really
you played a big part in this operation
the success of this operation depended on skilful planning
he means you
will you get a promotion
as a police officer
i do not fight crime to get promoted
i am not worried about promotions
Did Chu Tu try to bribe you
he sure did with millions
he could have bribed the whole force
Just kidding
do not put that down
can you two sit closer
what are you doing
Just saying hello
do not sit too close
Let me sit here
he will come this way right
yeah
Let's start
Straighten up your back
Open your eyes a bit more
Open your mouth
Wider
Wider still
more
Forget it just be yourself
Ready
the handcuffs in the middle
Try to be more energetic
Your plan would not work
Why not
Remember she is Chu Tu's secretary not just anyone can get that job
Chu Tu's been arrested and once he knows his secretary is going to be a witness what will he do
he will do everything he can to stop her appearing in court
Whoever we send to protect her will be in danger
do not be a cop if you are not willing to risk your life
Put that line on one of our recruitment posters
we do not have enough evidence to prosecute him
we must push him into a corner
then we can put him behind bars
who is going to protect her
i suggest
i have someone in mind already
Great minds think alike
Good luck to him
you are the only one who got bail
you are really lucky
they are here to see the Super
Please wait
Please wait
Right
you can leave after you have seen him
you can go in now
Thanks
Please sit down
you can leave now Miss Fong
Wait a second
Please keep this subpoena you will need it to appear in court
what is the charge
nothing
but you will be acting as our witness
i am sorry
my client is not going to do that
we are not asking her
According to law she has to do it
Inspector Chan
Your job is to protect Miss Fong until she appears in court
me
Protect her
Why not
Great
i do not need his protection
as long as he doesn't harass you you can not refuse
Inspector Chan
as an escort of the witness you must be aware that the witness is often faced with threat disturbance and assault or irritated by the intentions of such
it is your duty to see her safety and personal rights are intact
yes sir
but can you send someone else
you will get expenses for this assignment
HK32 per day
it is an old tradition unchanged for years
i know it is very little
that is all
can we talk to you alone Miss Fong
my client doesn't answer questions without the presence of her lawyer
we won't ask her any questions
we just want some advice for her own good
you have the right to refuse this
Let me see what they have to say
Mr Cheung
Please excuse us
you do not have to answer if they ask you any questions about the case or others
Get out of here
i have to go too
what is your rank
what do you want to talk to me about
nothing you can go now
See you in court
Did they ask
Let's go
Ka kui
Your tape recorder
OK
what did they say to you
they did not say anything
i am your lawyer you can trust me
they did not say a word to me
Why was it only her
they are coming
how is boss and the others
i can not bail them out
what about Salina then
she is their witness
what
Really
they want me to do it
you should have turned it down
Stop bothering our witness
who are you
i am a cop
my duty is to protect her
if you keep doing that i can charge you with interfering with the police
Salina
you can only say goodbye or bye bye
one more word and you are under arrest
i will take you home
that is part of my job
i will tell them nothing
now what Mr Cheung
i will see your boss this afternoon
all right
Let's go
it is dangerous for you to hang around outside
Let's go home shall we
it is none of your business
it is for your own safety
i do not need your protection you fool
you know what happened to the last witness who said that
what happened
were they shot
do not try to scare me
it won't work
you are right
they were fine in the end
you can say whatever you want
you can not scare me
all the evidence points to the defendants
Only your situation is better
we are depending on you Mr Cheung
i will do my best
You'd better be prepared for bad news
the chances are slim
if i walk away free
i will take good care of you
there is still something we need to worry about
Salina is their witness
is she really
she is been granted bail
the police even gave her an escort the guy who arrested you
Salina doesn't know much
she is new
that doesn't concern me
but she could say something bad about us in court
i do not think she would
all right
Call Danny for me
Tell him to take care of Salina
all right
Thanks a lot
Keep the change
See you later
it is dangerous to stay home alone
i always live dangerously
John
i just got back
the phone is tapped
all right i will meet you later
i am really scared
you think you can scare me like that
Help
Help
i am going to kill you
do not go
i will get you
you have to die
i am going to kill you
Go to hell
Go to hell
i got you
i am going to kill you
do not run away
i have got you now
Go to hell
here i come
Hide no where
there is no way out
you are finished
i am going to kill you
do not worry
i am here
she is terrified
can i go now
you can leave right now
Hold on to him i will call the police
i knocked him out
not yet
he is still conscious
he is fighting me
Keep away from us
Please go now
you can not stay here any longer
do not faint
Go
i go
he is passed out
no
he is still conscious
See
Look at me
do not
Please leave here right now
Go now
Go on
Go
Hurry
no more acting
Let s go
Leave him to me
he is fainted
this time is real
Let me hit him one more time
Stop or we won't be able to identify him
i do not want to do this any more
i do not know him
They'd use a stranger to kill you
Why kill me
of course Chu Tu's a ruthless man
Inspector Chou it is Ka kui
i just realised this is a tough case
can you send a replacement
no
i am not risking my life for a few thousands
i have had enough of her
i do not give a damn about her any more
i quit
Enough is enough
where are you going
Home
you are supposed to protect me
but you are not cooperating
how can i protect you
what if i cooperate
it is too late
i quit
i can not believe it
you cops have no sense of duty
i have
but there is nothing i can do
if i stay here i will get killed too
i will cooperate
i am not forcing you
i am doing it of my own free will
you should come to my house it is much safer there
Great
Look at you
i will get changed
Chu's men could be back any time
i won't change my clothes then
now what
what is it
i am checking to see if everything's OK
Go back
Come out
Why are you holding that
this is your jacket
i told you to put it on
yes
Follow me
Use my car
which one is yours
over there
Why are you not nervous at all
i am used to situations like this
i told you to stay quiet did not l
now what
my son
Yours
Close the car door
it is me
Give me my gun
it is in my jacket pocket
Help
i have got you
Freeze
Freeze
Stay calm
Give me the gun
Stay calm
Keep away
Go
Give me the gun
it is me
are you all right
where are they
you scared them off with that shot
we must get you away from here those guys are for real
who was the guy at my house then
he wanted to kill you too
but these are professionals
i see why you are nervous now
Get in the car
you are crying
how could Chu Tu do this to me
you can not be that naive
Your boss is capable of anything
he can not have you in that courtroom
what should i do then
you should tell the judge everything so he can put Chu in jail and then you will be safe
what should i say to the judge
what rackets Chu Tu's involved in who his contacts are who the dealers are
Why are you taping this
it is for my own reference
how long have you worked for him
Four years
he is a family friend
he used to give my mother money to buy me food
now you help him deal drugs
i hardly know anything
you can still tell me what you do know
if you remember anything else do not forget to tell me
do you have enough to prosecute him
that is for the court to decide
what you have told me is very useful
Come in
Let me turn on the lights
it is may
i almost forgot today's my birthday
are you all right
Let me introduce you this is Miss Fong
Let's go
are you all right
i am fine
may
they have all gone
that was quick
it is all my fault
she wanted to surprise you but you brought me here
and i am dressed like this
of course she is angry
i am angry too
i did not even have the chance to explain
she dumped the cake on me
i won't answer if she calls to apologize
i doubt she will
i knew she would be back
what so happy about it
i saw may
what is wrong
she saw me with our witness
i will go and explain to her
no need
Tell her to curb her temper
Why do i have to explain everything to everyone
i am sick and tired of it
do you want some cake
what about a drink then
Orange juice please
Help yourself
do you live alone
it is too big they'd get me for corruption
i rent it with a friend
and he is away
i am really sorry
Your girlfriend was furious when she saw me
do not worry
i was doing my job
Come on
Come in
you will be all right
i am leaving
See you
i am just a cop now
but i might become a movie star and have to kiss ladies passionately
what would she do then
she loves you so she is jealous
i will explain to her
what for
she will never understand me
are not you going to say something nice to her
no way
if i started sweet talking
I'd have a million girls
you love her a lot do not you
to be honest i do love her a lot
but loving her is one thing apologizing is another
when she gets home she will call and apologize to me
what a waste of food
Am i right
she could not wait to call me
hello
hello
is that your girlfriend
it is her
she is crying
Stop crying
you should not humiliate me in front of people
what
if i was with a man you'd think i was gay
you are so childish
Curb your temper
Let me explain to her
no need
Curb that temper of yours
you should show me some respect
Stop crying
Talk to you later
it is time to teach her a good lesson
when did she come back
Right after you went in the shower
so she heard everything
the phone call
not again
may
Let me explain
she is our witness my job is to protect her
i am mad about what you just said
i was just kidding
do not be mad
Why are you angry
Why
you just insulted me in front of her
how dare you
Go away
Please listen to me
may
may
are you all right
no
are you happy now
i hurt
of course i am not
i did not mean to do that
Your shoe
here put it on
Go away
may please listen to me
no i do not want to
do not be so childish
Listen to me will you
Let me go
be careful
i hate you
where is she
i accepted her apologies and she went home
oh you
that hurt
what did i do
you really poked me
you are breaking it
do not push too hard
what an ugly thing
Go away
it is the only one i got
it is broken
you got me all wet
Let me wipe it for you
Please no more
no do not
not there here
here
be gentle
that hurt
this sofa's hard it is not very comfy
Let's go to bed now
Let's go to bed
but where can i sleep
on my bed
and you
next to you
you are so protective
it is exciting
i am going to bed
do not wake me up
Women are weird
hello
Ka kui
Wait
he is on the line
you are late
we are waiting for you
he is not here
i know it is you
Quick
Get that witness here
what was your duty on that day
i was observing the squatter huts behind the site
the suspects were trying to escape and i arrested two of them
Thank you
can i ask the witness a question
Inspector Kim you said you saw the suspects escaping
Did they pass in front of you one by one
or did you have a special device to allow you see them escaping at the same time
i object
i object
the question played with the witness's wording
Overruled
Thank you
no more questions
Bring on the next witness
that is my spot
i am in a hurry
i want that space
Nice parking though
what
she is gone
what have you been up to
now what
we might lose
i do not know
we will lose
how could you be so sure that one of the escaping suspects was my client
he had the same clothes
in other words you did not have a clear view of the suspects' faces
i would say so
are you short sighted
no i am not
all right
no more questions
next witness
i swear to tell the truth
i was at the squatter huts for the operation
the first second third and fourth defendants opened fire
i saw them jump on a bus
so i took a short cut and went down the hill
a citizen helped me to stop the bus with his car
after the bus stopped
i arrested the first defendant
he tried to bribe me but i refused
that was very clear
Thank you
you were at the squatter house
what time was that
about 6 00 am
what time exactly
5 55am
Let's say 6 00am
in December in Hong Kong sunrise is at 6 23am
Did you know that
i did not know
is that true
i do not know
do you know the saying
Darkness before dawn
no i do not
the saying means that it is dark before the sun rises
i might have heard of it
all right
if there was not much light should we believe you could actually see my client
Believe what you like
i did see him
it is your business
you should not ask me
you said you ran down the hill to stop the bus
was the bus always in sight
yes
Why hesitate
i was thinking
you have doubts
Objection
do not hound him
Rephrase the question
how long did it take you to go down the hill
and was the bus always in sight
for a while my view was blocked by the hill
could it be that another bus overtook the first one at that point
there was only one bus
you are lying
Sustained
Defence should rephrase his question
could you be mistaken
no
there are four different bus routes on that road
on two routes the buses run every five minutes
the other two the buses run every six minutes
so 88 buses run back and forth on that road every hour
that is more than one bus a minute
so what
how long did it take you to go down the hill
about two minutes
Exactly
two minutes and half
so at most eight or night buses could have passed by
but you said there was one
i say you are lying
do not you know the buses are always late
all right
Let's give you the benefit of the doubt
Assume there was one bus and you could see it all the time
which part was clearly visible to you
the body
how much of the body
all of it
you are lying
what is he doing
you could see only one side of this bus
at most only half of it
you could not see the other half
Am i right
yes
and anything could have happened on the side you could not see
yes
so if someone jumped off you could not see him could you
no
Speak louder
i could have jumped off he could not
Just answer the question
i mean it
you try jumping from a moving bus
Control yourself
if that is not him why did he bribe me
Why would he do that
he offered me money to let him go
if it was you and someone pointed a gun at you what would you do
Objection
Objection overruled
Answer him
I'd give him all my money
that is what happened to my client
Am i right
no I'd already identified myself
there are many cases where criminals pose as policemen
Sustained
Court will ignore that remark
Confine yourself to this case
i am sorry
Consider this a businessman is carrying company cash on a bus
a policeman chasing robbers stops the bus and points a gun at him
so the businessman thinks the policeman is a crook
so he tells the policeman to take the cash and let him go
Inspector Chan is not that right
Objection
the witness needn't answer
we already know the answer
he doesn't need to say it
i conclude
Wonderful
now what
i know what to do
he will get off the hook
he won't
Your Honour we request an adjournment
our prime witness was delayed
Objection
the Crown has failed to establish a case
there is insufficient evidence to convict my client
i request a dismissal
Your Honour
we have taped evidence from our witness
Tapes can not be accepted as evidence
that tape is key to this case
Objection
i will not adjourn or postpone the hearing
that would be unfair to the defendant
i will grant him bail
but we will hear that tape first
Please turn up the volume
it is a cheap tape
Thanks
Wait
i did not erase that
Just let it play
it is coming up
oh you
that hurts
what did i do
you really poked me
you are breaking it
do not push too hard
what an ugly thing
Go away
it is the only one i got
it is my treasure
it is only a cactus
what is happening
you got me all wet
Let me wipe it for you
Please no more
no do not
that was only orange juice
that was not what you think
be gentle
that hurt
the sofa's hard
it is not very comfy
Let's go to bed now
Let's go to bed
OK
but where can i sleep
on my bed
and you
next to you
you are so protective
it is exciting
Come on
Please be cooperative
Stand back please
no photographs
Ka kui
i want a written report
Boss
here
no pictures
Get back
John reserve a room at the country club
we are going to celebrate
i am leaving now
Thank you very much
next time let's hire him as prosecutor
this is Crime Story
i am so happy to see you all again
our guest today is a brave police officer
Sitting next to me is
Inspector Chan Ka kui
hello
hello
hello
hello everyone
after cracking down on the biggest drug racket in Hong Kong you have become very popular amongst the people
would you share this particular experience with us
the success of this operation was due to team work
i was just a part of it
we were well prepared for the operation
what makes your department so special in the police force
to be one of us you have to be strong alert smart and
Boss
what is up
his photo is all over the papers and magazines
and he had won the Brave Policeman Arrests Drug Tycoon
and our Thai source is out of stock
what
are they crazy
they have sold everything to Uncle Joe
they want hard cash
Boss Mr Cheung is here
Please come in
Mr Chu i have received your cheque thanks a lot
i should thank you
how is my case now
all evidence must remain with the court until the case ends
what does that include
Your passport and bank account
you can not use them now
if you are found guilty your assets will be confiscated
and besides the bastards could jail me
Phone call for you Boss
Excuse me
Salina
it is boring here
i want to go somewhere else
not just yet
can i come and see you
not now
you should stay where you are
the police are looking for you
i am planning a trip to Europe for you
Once you are there you will be fine
you just have to wait
it is for your own good
where were we
we were lucky to bail you out
it would have been different if they had found Salina
i doubt they will ever be able to find her
Very well
i must leave
See you
Bye
Your lawyer is right
Salina's a big problem
you can not hide her forever
True
Snake Eyes says that stupid cop is looking for Salina everywhere
we should send her abroad
on a one way ticket
Let's use that stupid cop to kill Salina
be sensible
Chicks like her are not difficult to get
Inspector Man wants to see you
Let him in
you paid him off did not you
yes i did

what does that mean
he wants more money

the Family Planning Clinic
Take a double portion of contraception pills
Free

Tell your own mum to take contraception pills

i was saying that to someone else
hello
hello
Tell my mum to take contraception pills
my mum doesn't need those pills
Police Station
i am testing the line bye
what
Stuck in traffic
no not traffic
you are late
if the roads were congested i would not be here at all
you are having dinner with us
Mum hates it when anyone's late
may listen
i have been waiting all day
you are off that case
Forget about it
i can not
i need to make a phone call
Hold on to the car
the hand brake doesn't work
do not let go
it is me Snake Eyes
Chu Tu's hiding that witness you are looking for in his Kowloon villa
you sure
Better hurry
they do not plan to keep her alive
is it true
would i lie to you
Hurry up
may
are you coming
that was Snake Eyes
i know where they are hiding Salina
do not go
if Chu Tu kills her he will go free
i have got to save her
i can not let her die
what is up
Your car
what now
Taxi
Call someone to tow the car away
and say sorry to your mum for me
be careful
Keep the change
Thanks
what happened
i do not know what they are up to
is anyone else here
no one
they just disappeared
now you know what Chu Tu is like
if you had listened to me you would not be in danger
it is lucky i got here
otherwise you'd be dead
Let's get out of here
Go
Stop
Step aside
how did you know i was here
i have my ways
you can not be
Surprised
that is not the only surprise
we were supposed to kill him
that is right
the boss wants us to use a police gun
one cop kills another
what a perfect set up
who is killing who
Let's get out of here
Move it
no i can not do it
no
Jump
Move it
Stop
Go get her
you little prick
we will teach you
you will wish you'd never interfered
that is enough
Take care of him
i will go down
Ka kui did not shoot Inspector Man
we can not take your word for it
we need evidence
if he did not do it
where did he go with his gun
the bullet that killed Man was fired from Ka kui's gun
Explain it
Policemen make lots of enemies
someone is trying to frame Ka kui
if it were anyone else but Ka kui would you feel the same
you are the boss
do not always go by the book
Show some feelings for your men
i do not want people thinking if a cop kills he gets away with it
there will be no cover up
one law for all
you want to nail him even more than the crooks
Enough
if you were me what would you do
hi may
i know
i will wait for you
one Cop Kills another
Policeman is Killed
what should we do
my mum is really worried about you
Ka kui be careful
Ka kui's back
Ka kui
Ka kui
Ka kui
i did not kill him
we believe you
but where have you been
i do not know
you must remember something
were you drunk or with your girlfriend
i was fighting Chu Tu's men
Inspector Man appeared and pointed his gun at me
they took my revolver and shot Man with it
that is all i remember
nothing else
you disliked Man and the bullet was from your gun
do not you know
i would not kill him over some petty differences
who would believe that
we must have proof
that is how the law works
but i am glad you are back
Give me your gun
Call Homicide
Tell them we have the suspect
Ka kui do not worry
we will do our very best to help you
Lock him up
and charge him with murder
how could you
Freeze
Ka kui what are you doing
i did not kill anyone
do not you believe me
i believe you
but based on the evidence
i must charge you
can not you see i was framed
you are bloody stupid
i will conduct a very thorough investigation
do not give me that
Let him go
what
what you are doing is dangerous
Dangerous for him
while we risk our lives out there he is sitting back thinking of chicks
we have arrested so many bad guys but he is never satisfied
he just considers the result
and he uses dirty tricks to catch Chu Tu and that stupid idea of protecting the witness
so easy
you only have to open your mouth and we have to risk our lives
Ka kui
Shut up
you got promoted at our expense
have you ever thought of us
if any of us dies you need only write a report and turn up for the funeral
we have families too
if it was not for us you'd never have this office and all this other crap
Ka kui
Go away
Come any closer and i will blow his head off
Ka kui do not do that
Open the door
do not move

where is she
Caroline oh God
i was at the health club when the police called me
oh God
what
she is in a coma right now and her brain is swelling but they are giving her Mannitol which will reduce the inflammation
lf it doesn't then they will have to put in a shunt
now i have called Jonah Ho itz the head of neurosurgey at Shadyside and he is going to take over her care
you know you know him
yes i worked with him when i was a resident
he is one of the best neurosurgeons on the east coast
oh
oh thank God you are here
it is going to be OK
it is fine
do not wory
MlLNER
i know we have to take a cut and none of us want to see the mill close but i need some help convincing them and we will need some more equity
Well how much you thinking about
MlLNER
you want an eleven percent pay cut
we want you to make that up in stock
it should be about enty percent of the company over the next five years
no
that would give you fim percent ownership
that is what the workers want
Well i think what John's obiecting to is losing maiority ownership right
Ten percent pay cut fom nine percent ownership stake
DraR an agreement along those lines
Meeting's at elve
we will hear what the workers have to say
we will be there
Good to see you Stan
they are not going to go for this
we will iust have to sell the opportunity
Knock on door

he is the best neurosurgeon in the city
CAROLlNE
i do not care
BRlAN
Caroline OK
the drugs are not working
the shunt's been in for eight hours and the pressure hasn't been relieved
CAROLlNE
but Dr Berman says the pressure is leveling off
BRlAN
but it is not going down
CAROLlNE
but it is leveling
BRlAN
Caro a craniotomy is probably the only option that we have
CAROLlNE
oh gosh
she could get a brain infection or not come out of the anesthetic
BRlAN
we can not keep waiting for the medication to work
OK
the longer the pressure stays at this level the greater the risk of brain damage
but Dr Berman
you are trusting the word of a trauma specialist at a small hospital over the opinion of a world class surgeon
you know you should not even be a part of this decision
she is my wife
CAROLlNE
no
she was your wife
Hey Brian
Hey
Nick
how is your hand

Twenty three
he is in his thirties
his parents looked like each other
you know
Redheads
Bible says siblings should not mary
Well that is true
no the mill's going to close this time Red
Clayton iust doesn't have the money to keep it open
Sal and Milt think he is lying
i think they are pushing the boys in the in the wrong direction
People spent the last thim years around here losing ground being forgotten
while you were downtown making all that money we were living through recessions that never quite ended plant closings friends leaving
None of us wanted our kids to stay here in Mt
Aire
most of us could not even help them to get out of here
you know i remember what it was like
most of us are not looking back at it
we are living it here evey day
Men are done begging for their iobs
they have begged enough
but what they do not understand is they are owners now
Gotta start thinking like owners
you think when you came back here Iast year you changed lives
None of us thought for a moment we'd ever see a return from Clayton
we iust needed our iobs
Still do
but at a certain point a job doesn't pay enough to fight for it

it happened at the intersection of Route Fim one and Connell Road
and Kirsten
i will let the doctor talk to you about her
Todd uh social services want to place Kenny in a psychiatric hospital
what
Unless you want to take him in
he is autistic
you think he should be locked in a psych ward for the rest of his life
i will need a lot of help to do this
lf social services approves the placement
what do you mean
they are going to want to do a home study check to see if you have a criminal record
do you
no i do not
Well if they approve and the judge agrees then the county will pay you as a foster parent
i do not know
i mean i do not have a lot of money
i work o iobs already
i still can not make ends meet
lf you take Kenny in you could cover his expenses by filing a lawsuit
a lawsuit
i do not believe that the accident was Kirsten's fault
Well who would i sue
Begin with Mt
Aire
there should've been a stop sign at that intersection
Well how much could Kenny get
Given the situation i think a juy would be vey generous
Kenny's social worker's name is Sofia
she is going to be here in a few minutes to pick him up
i will wait here with him
lndistinct talking over PA
ls Lulu alone

i will not be rushed into doing something that i will regret later
Did you communicate that to Brian
i can challenge him can not l
his standing
i can take him to court
Well if you really want to do that

Well the workers voted today

Well you are still going to take your money out
i have no choice
Well i will see you tomorrow
do not stay too late
hi

the social worker's coming out to my house in the morning
anything i should know about that
she is going to check to see if you have a clean house a bed for Kenny just ask you some questions
and if we want to sue
first you need to become Kenny's guardian
Right
then you need to hire a lawyer
what about you
there are conflicts
what do you mean
i was in the other car
i do not get it
Why would you want to help us
Your friend got hurt like she did
i told you it was not Kirsten's fault
that woman in the accident is she your girlfriend
we got a lot in common
a lot in common
this is a conflict waiver signed by Mr Doughem allowing me to represent him
Just so you know i was in this accident
there have been thirteen accidents at the intersection of Route Fim one and Connell Road in the past five years
it is our position that if that intersection had had a stop sign those accidents would not have happened
we received your notice of claim Mr Fallin
we know what your allegations are
my client is autistic
we have estimated his lifetime support needs to be in excess of eleven million dollars
Mt
Aire is a small township on the verge of bankruptcy
i think their insurance carrier can pay for it
Give me a few days to look over your claim
Great
that lady from social services Sofia
she came by the house this morning
OK
she seemed concerned about my being able to take care of Kenny
Well that is iust her iob
i told her you know they were supposed to be living with me before the accident
she kept saying how Kirsten was used to taking care of kids like Kenny
do you want to do this
yeah
i iust she kind of freaked me out
you really think this lawsuit is going to work
yes
' Cause it would help
you know i could pay people you know to help and stuff
Well the shelter hearing's in o hours
i will meet you at the courthouse
Nicholas
Nicholas
are you suing Mt
Aire over this accident
there should've been a stop sign
you think we are the right firm for it
Why not
Why not we iust give it to Ron Lampeer over at Sutter and Feldman
they will give us fim percent and we won't look conflicted
who cares what we look like
we are not conflicted
i have a conflict waiver and i am not bringing a claim against anyone for my injuries
what about Lulu
she can decide what she wants to do when she recovers
ls this about Mt
Aire
yeah
they iust lost the mill
now we look like we are involved in bankrupting the township
what difference does it make if Sutter Feldman does this instead of us
it is going to happen either way
WOMAN OVER PA
Orderly to admitting
Orderly report to admitting
she is in surgey
no
what
not yet
Caroline told the hospital she disagreed with my decision and hired a lawyer to fight me
where is she
she went to get coffee or
what do you want to bring a lawyer into this for
by the time he gets an iniunction and drags Brian through the courtroom
you are on Brian's side
the Mannitol is not working the shunt is not working
what makes you think you even have a right to discuss this with me
lndistinct talking over PA
Caroline sobs
she is such a smart girl
she is so beautiful
she is so strong
who is going to love her aRer i die
lf she is unable to speak if she is unable to walk and i am not there for her anymore who is going to love her then
you know evey day that passes she is
she is another day closer to spending the rest of her life in a coma
i know how you feel about her Nick
Believe me
i can see that
and if it were your choice i know just what you would do
and if she died during the operation well you could walk away with all of your life before you knowing that you did evemhing you could for her
but it is different for a mother
i would rather see Lulu peaceful and alive than
do you understand me
Come in
have a seat Evan
OK
i am uh glad you came by
you know uh Clayton is liquidating
which means there is no way that they are going to have enough money to match your funds
yeah i anticipated that and uh i have a backup plan
there is this not for profit in Harrisburg the uh Clymer Foundation
they are apparently interested in urban redevelopment so uh i am going to go have a meeting with them tomorrow
Well the truth is
i have been giving this a lot of thought and i do not see i do not see any future in Mt
Aire
what
the mill closes the few families that are there now are going to leave
Monessen Donora Homestead
i have seen it happen again and again and again
People are still going to live in Mt
Aire
are you
Guys your age going to live there
Evan you are a smart guy
lf i were you I'd get the hell out
Well i do not want to leave
Well i tell you what i can do Evan
i can help you
i can find you an appropriate iob if you want
i might even consider investing in one of your future projects but not a children's center in a town with no kids
Look you pledged that money
yeah i did and i am afraid i am going to have to ask you to give it back
Give it back
it is already been committed
Yesterday i signed a contract to buy three storefronts on Main Street
it is pe ect for the children's center
the earnest money alone was fom grand
all right give me back sixty thousand and we will iust write off the rest as a mistake
oh come on
what is 100 OOO to you
that is a lot of money son
you know what my father said
when you returned last year for the reorganization he said you were tying to buy their forgiveness
that is not true
oh yeah
then prove it to me that he is wrong and help me make this work
Kenny Traeger is an orphan
the only father figure he has known over the past few years is Todd Doughem
Kenny's mother and Mr Doughem were romantically involved and as of last week they were planning to live together
now i know that social services has evaluated Todd and although Mrs Trokey has voiced tOMe COnCelnt about placing Kenny with him
i feel that Todd is a far better alternative than a psychiatric hospital
lndistinct talking
so you are his guardian now
you will be responsible for evey aspect of his care
Good luck
you have my number at work
Your foster care checks won't start coming in for a couple of weeks
here is the address of a respite care center for Kenny if you get tired
OK
See you soon
so i iust take him home now
i will see you at my office tomorrow for the meeting with Mt
Aire's counsel
lndistinct talking and telephones ringing
Hey h how'd it go
Good
Good
Burton was completely understanding
i told you
the Fallins they are just soRies
so listen i have to go to Harrisburg to meet the guys from Clymer
Well can not it wait until this weekend
the thing is that um
i told them about the plant closing and uh they seem really interested
i feel like if i hesitate that i might lose them
oh um when are you leaving
now
should we change the appointment with the district justice
uh well that is not till fou'r thim so i should be back around o OK

See you Brian
RYDER
this is John Peelor
he is a safety engineer who reconstructs accidents
he will be the expert on this case
Mr Peelor
here is the scene of the accident
here is where the black Suburban impacted the green Passat
Given the angle of the impact it is clear that the driver of the Suburban took no evasive measures prior to the collision
there are no skid marks no swerve marks
ln other words the driver of the Suburban was either suicidal or had no idea what was about to happen because she was not looking
what was she doing
Miss Turk shattered the leR side of her face
she also broke her leR arm five of the ribs on her leR side
her leR hip was fractured
her right side absorbed nearly none of the impact
OK
Meaning if i may demonstrate
she was in this position when the cars collided
now i asked myself why would she be in this position
NlCK
Looks fine
Exactly
the buckles weren't engaged at the time of the accident
lf they were and the boy were in his seat they would be distressed and the frame would be bent
it is not
Miss Turk's autistic son was loose in the back seat and she was turned around tying to contain him
she was not watching the road when the accident occurred
i reviewed the medical records as well
what you are forgetting is she also had a fractured right cheekbone
i noticed that but that injuy is not consistent with the type of fracture one sustains in a high impact car accident
Wait you can not iust rule it out
it is not from this accident Mr Fallin
it is a blunt trauma from something else
lndistinct talking and telephones ringing
so there is no lawsuit
you can have someone else review the data
that guy what he was saying was
Kenny was responsible for the accident
she forgot to buckle him in
i have seen Kenny do stuff like that
i mean he doesn't know what is dangerous
Walk in front of cars put his hand on a hot stove
can you be trusted with him Todd
what
can you be trusted with him because if you hit his mother how can you handle a kid like Kenny
you did hit her did not you
Kirsten was so tired
her life was so hard
sometimes she hit the wall and sometimes she hit Kenny
you fractured her cheekbone
that was a mistake
i came home to the house
i saw her pulling Kenny out of his chair by his hair and i stepped in and i hit her but i never hit Kenny
i have to tell social services
Beeping
Hey Nick
Hey
i thought you might need a witness or something

ls that why you been coming around here making your peace before you die
Maybe
you know when you said you wanted to do something for me
yeah
you can
what
my kid
Well i am tying to help him Red
do not
People been doing things for him all his life
lf you really want to do something for him
let him make his own way
he is not coming
he is not coming
do you want me to tell the justice
no no no
Just just wait a minute
he is not coming
JUDGE
Come in
Sir he is he is not coming
Door shuts
did not really like him an ay
Door shuts
i told you I'd make it
Ah Nick
Sofia called Mr Doughem and told him that social services would be making unscheduled visits to monitor his care of Kenny and that Kenny would have to undergo a weekly physical examination for signs of abuse
Good
no
he changed his mind
he doesn't want Kenny under those circumstances so there will be another shelter hearing the first thing next week
Right
they are keeping Kenny at Southwestern Psych for the short term
can not you advocate to have him placed somewhere else
there is nowhere else for that kid to go
Monitor beeping
Lulu
they would not let me come see you
before this happened you were uh you were talking to me about fate and uh not getting in the way of things
Lulu if you are not there anymore if you are not going to be the way you were then let go

you can iust let go

TOMMY
i cannot believe the size of this place

TANYA
it is like looking for a needle in a haystack
we are not even sure what we are looking for
JUSTlN
we know it is trouble
ADAM
and if we do not find whatever we are looking for it means bigger trouble
yeah this place is too big to find anything together
the only way we are going to find it is we just got to split up
you guys start at the outside and work in
we will start at the middle and work out
got it
got it
all right guys ready
Ready
Ready
Let's do it
KAT
i wish there was a way to know where to look

Justin go back to the Power Chamber
Sure but how come

DlVATOX
Hmm
cackling
Ticktock ticktock
Look at those simpletons
they could not find pointy ears at a Star Trek convention
ALPHA
oh is not it exciting
Alpha what is that
Ay yi yi yi
Justin do not sneak up on me like that
you frightened me
what are you doing here
Tommy said you might be able to adjust the Turbo Navigator to help us at the power plant
oh well um it is just that
Ay yi yi
Justin the Turbo Navigator will automatically respond to any extraterrestrial organism or device
no alterations are necessary
Thanks Zordon
Alpha moaning

how about you
KAT

JUSTlN

Let's get over there
TANYA

Hey Tanya did you hear about the job at the radio station
you guys are looking at the new trainee at KAGV
what are you doing this summer
i will be working as a stuntman at the Angel Grove Amusement Park
Lieutenant Stone where did they come from
i found them wandering around outside and they dragged me in here
i think they are trying to tell me something
Lieutenant Stone it is us Bulk and Skull
Tanya Adam anyone do not you recognize us
Hey
a banana split
Man i got to have that banana split
STONE
he is trying to tell me something
panting shrieking
W w wait
yells laughter
you know there is something awfully familiar about you two
Ay yi yi
Zordon it is getting close and we haven't heard from Lerigot yet
there is no need to worry Alpha
Lerigot has never let us down
i know Zordon
huh
what
oh Lerigot you made it
Home going soon
yes
Welcome Lerigot
Alpha check the status of the wormhole
the wormhole is nearly ready for inter dimensional travel
must go soon
as soon as it is ready call the Rangers
yes Zordon
Ah a wormhole
Porto where does the passage through the wormhole end
by my calculations the Planet Eltar
but who would want to go there
there is only one intergalactic being on Earth that has any reason to take a trip to Eltar
this could be my lucky day after all
on the next
Lerigot prepares for a long journey and Zordon makes a startling announcement
Zordon
there is no easy way to tell you
Tell us what
a wormhole in space provides the way home for Lerigot but Divatox makes other plans
Find a way to close the wormhole
then she summons Amphibitor to help
Soon nothing will stand in my way
can our heroes help Lerigot make his journey
Find out on the next
Darn it
Wait
one second
Wait
laughing
MAN
Phone call for Jason Frank
Captioned by Grant Browni decided not to produce the movie
there is this girl that
i am kind of in love with and
i could not be away from her for another day
i know the label's gonna run a lot smoother
with you at the helm
i am not here to run the label
i am here to close it
you are mad because i want you to move out
but it is only because i am trying to step things up with millie
you trying to get rid of me with your naked ass
it ain't gonna work
you know earlier when
when i said i miss david
what happened quinn
you said he
i left him
Clay does that girl look familiar to you
yeah she was at the party today
Why
she says she slept with you on the road nate
and she is going public
one tree hiil s07e02 sync by yescool
British accent
and where will you run
Back to the life of a peasant harlot
British accent
perhaps i will
but should i return to a life of more meager means
i will do so with my dignity intact
my heart pure and true
and yet you had no dignity nor purity
in my bed a fortnight ago
Scoffs lightly
Meager means indeed
Harlot
Leave the dress
Millie was right
Alex dupr is the perfect choice
to be the face of the new campaign
Water splashing
she is smart
she is talented
she is crazy beautiful
Julian
Julian i am shaving
how come this movie never came out
because smart and talented and beautiful

Aww my baby's so good to me
Damn
i am really gonna like this living Together thing
Chucuckles
i want you to move your stuff in okay
this is our house now not just mine
Good
Well then how would you feel about going back

I'd make a joke about meager means but British accent
it would simply be untrue
Chuckles
to know
all that is gold
Hey
you know i am not judging you right
Clay listen man you have known me for a long time now
i do not care what that woman says
i did not sleep with her all right

i am in the headlines my family's in the headlines
and i am guilty before i am innocent
do not freak out
you are not in the headlines yet
and believe it or not this kind of thing
it happens a lot

Cellphone ringing

Wait

Hey boys
Ready for the beach
what are you guys up to
nothing nothing
huh that girl's a genius
whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh Engine turns over
Dan never believe that you can deceive
you might think that you can get away with it
you might actually get away with it
for a while
but your life is made up of choices and decisions
Knock on door
hi julian
Dad
what are you doing here
i came to talk you out of the worst decision of your life
Poor choices poor life
Bad decisions
Bad life
Come on
where is it
Miranda page 17 item 4
it is the part of the contract that basically says
we can acquire the label whenever we'd like
Dan wickedness
as you know i have been there
i am not alone
my wife was too
she was deceptive and manipulative
she abused drink and drugs
she was promiscuous
but today she stands beside me a changed woman
a caring woman a better woman
Ladies and gentlemen my wife and the love of my life
Cheers and applause
Jet's she is a genius playing my girl's ready to take control
she just blows my mind
she only listens to the radio
i love you honey
i love you honey yeah she wakes up scared of getting old
i did not make a bad decision dad
is that right
you walked away from a potential blockbuster movie
Days before production and for what
for love
Love
with brooke davis
be careful dad
Julian she is brooke davis
i read the tabloids
this is a fling for her
and it could cost you your career
i think you need to leave
Sighs
behind the tv screen i have fallen to my knees
Your career was one movie away from being prestigious
this movie
and you walk away
for what
a promiscuous fashion designer
i need to get away
blanket of silence
makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
burn all the evidence
oh this glass is gonna look amazing
in my loft in los angeles
all right miranda
i know that you have a legal right to shut down the label
but you do not have to be a total bitch about it
you are the producer haley
and potentially a great artist
but you do not have time to record
because you are running what is essentially a vanity label
Va a vanity la
you guys would not have
Mia catalano if it was not for this label
you would not have had the time or patience or interest
to develop an artist like her
that is what small labels do
we develop and nurture artists
it is something corporate labels will never do oh god i ain't got no other place to hide
i have always wanted a pool table
Sighs
i can not believe your dad just came all this way
to tell you he thinks you are making a mistake
he could not call or text or tweet that to you
he is a movie producer brooke
he loves the dramatic
Well what else did he say
he wanted to know what my game plan was
was i still actively producing
do i have a development staff
Finding me new properties and
that is some poster
what
oh right
you like it
yeah
it is different for the living room
he was just so crazy my father
do you think maybe you would like that better
in the spare bedroom
or in your office
we could get you an office for that
Look my dad just flew five hours
to ask me if i am quitting the business and getting married
what did you say
i asked him to leave
no about the marriage part
i told him he was crazy
we are not getting married
we just moved in together
Chuckles
i i do not i do not know what the hell got into him i ain't got no other place to hide
chained down like a sitting duck
just waiting for the fall
Hey you
the clock it was a good idea
i think it reminds people that every second counts
it is easy
People do not have to work that hard to get it
we have that dinner tonight
with the investment guys from texas
i think you should tell them
the whole phoenix rising from the ashes story
they will love it
it was a good show today
i think we might have reached some people
do you think it was a good show
i will let you know after i see the ratings
i got to go

or you could read it
and feel better for the rest of your life
Hey
what your name is man
my name is dan scott
and i believe in you
he probably did not mean it
it was just the way he said it
as if the very idea of us ever getting married
was somehow completely ridiculous to him
and then he hung this ugly army Man poster
in the living room
i have to talk to him
okay but he might freak out a little
if you start talking marriage so soon
no about the poster you dork

Hey are you sure skills and lauren
Won't be worried about you

Exhales

Sighs
Engine turns over
so can i talk to you
would you like to speak with me or talk to me
Chuckles oh brother you are a piece of work
so you are excited about my record right
John knight's excited about my record
which is why you guys want to close red bedroom
to free me up to record
in part yes
if you close red bedroom i am not gonna make an album
Haley you need to remove the emotion from this
it is a business decision
it is not personal
it is personal
everything about this label is personal
Why peyton started it why she made me her partner
it is as personal as it gets
if you do not record with us you do not record at all
we have a contract with you
we own you
but you do not own me
it is a pleasure to meet you mia
i have seen you perform a few times
but we have never been formally introduced
Miranda stone
Haley's told me a lot about you
Red bedroom records will always be important to us
but at the moment
can we just cut to the chase
how is chase
he is good
he says hi
Thanks
Aww i was there at your first date
oh i know
you and nathan were so great
both laugh
i sold more records
than any artist on our roster last year
but if this label goes away so do i
how so
you distribute my records
but i record for red bedroom exclusively
Peyton made sure of that
it is true
i checked
Wow
everyone has their price
no actually not everyone
Peyton and haley are responsible for my career
and you can not put a price on that
and even if you do i won't accept it
so congratulations
you are about to lose your biggest Selling artist
does that pretty much do it hales
yes
Thank you
so good to see you
oh good to see you too
you look so cute
Thanks
i will let you two talk
yeah
Sighs
who is the bitch now bitch
i am so sorry
i should have met with her first
i thought she was the girl from her movies
it is okay
i thought so too
she has been in that bathroom a really long time
what are we gonna do
i will tell you what we are not gonna do
we are not gonna pay that dum Dum 500 000
we will just have to tell her something
we will say the company went bankrupt or
or maybe
we should just start speaking spanish
and she will get really confused and she will just leave
i do not think that is gonna work
it might
she is really dumb
Alex brooke
Ibuenos das
Tenido mucha cerveza
Ay mucha cerveza
Sighs
it is okay
i uh i know i am not what you expected
you do not have to pay me
it is just
that is one of my designs
since rehab this dress is all i have
when i felt like i was nothing
it gave me strength and dignity
so no matter what happens to me
or where my life takes me
i will wear this dress
Your dress
and i will be fine
it is okay
of course we will pay you
i i think you look beautiful in that dress
and i think you are gonna be perfect
as the face of the line
Really
Chuckles
that is so rad
Laughs
oh
Yay
Hey
Look at this
it is all over the internet
the buzz is really positive
i did not really have buzz in mind
i know but that is why you have me
i am here if you need me
oh this way
Well hi
what are you doing
Fixing you dinner
and thinking about getting rid of my poster
Why
because you have to eat and because
you hate it
i do not hate it
yeah
no i do not
i just
i do not really like it there
it is okay
Chuckles
my father as you know was always gone
Always on some distant location or at the office
you know making movies
but this one time he came home and surprised me
and took me to see the thin red line
and then we spent the rest of the day together
Just him and me
and that did not happen very often
Actually that really never happened again
but that day
that was a good day
that was probably the best day i ever had with him
and that was the day i decided i wanted to make movies too
Like my dad
let it disappear into my hand
whoa yeah my hand
i appreciate you meeting me
oh so now you appreciate me
what happened to confrontational clay
i am confrontational because i am protective over nathan
and because of all my clients
he is the last one i'd expect to be in this situation
and what situation is that
you tell me
Ask me what is in the envelope
i am not here to play games
the night nathan scored 35 points against memphis
you threw a big party for him after the game
i should know
i was there
it got pretty wild
Get to the point
the pictures of what happened between me and nathan that night
are in the envelope
Whatever's in that envelope is meaningless or fabricated
because we both know
that whatever you are accusing him of doing he did not do
Maybe you should take a look
i spoke with john knight
he thinks mia's bluffing
and he still wants to fold the label
but i recommended we do not
Why
because integrity and loyalty still matter
does that surprise you that i actually have a heart
a little
and besides i do not think she is bluffing
and she makes us a lot of money
if i do this if
Your album needs to be finished in the next six months
Hmm
Why did peyton start this label anyway
you said it was personal
Exhales
she thought that major labels were soulless
we are
do not forget it we just do not see it the same way Sighs
but you are never sure
we can not go on like this anymore Knock on door
it is open
Brooke
you wanted to speak with me
you know my whole life
i wanted to get my mother to be proud of me
and then one night
Julian threatened to exile her from our lives
and i would do the same to you
i am just not sure it would matter
you are upset
i have this poster hanging in my living room paul
of course i am upset
and the only reason that it is hanging there
is because you took him to see that movie
and for one day
that boy felt close to his father
he felt loved and appreciated
and the sad part is
that there was only one of those days
because in my book
the day that he did not feel that way should be the unique one
Fix it the hardest thing about this is i still care
you know there is something better
for both of us out there
Hey
Hey' cause you wait for rain Sighs
How'd it go at the label
um
i think i fixed it temporarily
now i got to fix my sister
Did you talk to david
there is not that much to talk about
we grew apart
you know we stopped laughing as much
Stopped caring as much
Did something happen recently
one night in new york i went to go see spring awakening
with some friends
and after we took chuckles the subway
to this ridiculous open Mike night in brooklyn
and we watched these horrible performers
who for whatever reason
had to get onstage and be seen and heard
and as i am watching them
i am thinking that i understand them
you know they they were messy and and unsure
and maybe a little confused but
but they were doing what they needed to do
you know what their hearts needed them to do
and then david called my cellphone
and i did not want to answer
you know there was a time
when he would have been sitting right there
and and i would have loved that
but he hasn't been that guy in a while
you guys were great together you know
i mean you you were really happy
and then one day we weren't
and i know there is supposed to be
some big huge important reason why but there is not
it is just a feeling that i have
that this is not what i want for the rest of my life
People have a right to change quinn
yeah but they also have a right to stay the same
they have a right to be exactly the person
that they have always been
okay
i did not change haley
David changed
and now somehow i am the one who is broken because of it wait for rain
and i chase the stars
we just do not see
so tell me what the worst act was
that you saw that open Mike night
Come on
Sniffles exhales
there was this really angry guy
who sang cat's in the cradle
yeah i swear he was a serial killer
Laughs
when he got done everyone clapped
and he like sneered at the people who did not
Laughs
i guarantee you they are missing right now i chase the stars
i miss you haley Bob
i miss you too bring on the wrecking ball
you are not broken
Thanks
i hope not
hi son
i was just
Heading back to l a
and i wanted to
Say goodbye
okay
Listen
i came here to tell you
that i think you are wrong to put your relationship
before your career but Sighs
i think it is me who is been wrong
i was not around enough
and
i was too busy
Caring for fictional characters
instead of caring for the real ones in my life
you did fine dad there is just too much my my
that poster
that was a good day for us
the best my heart's as cold as ice
i do not remember it
i am sorry
it is okay
no it is not
i am proud of you son
you go live your life and
be happy
and whatever you do do not be like me okay
i will see you
the word that i breathe is a word that i need
and the songs that i sing do not mean anything
do not you wonder Door closes
why it is always been this way
all our innocence is gone
What'd she say
that night after your big game against memphis
we had that party
we got pretty wasted that night
yeah
so
Well that was three months ago if you like i will take the blame for all the things that you have done
she is three months pregnant nate my songs
on a cold night
i can not get you out
Man
british accent and where will you run
Back to the life of a peasant harlot
Alex
british accent perhaps i will
but should i return to a life of more meager means
i will do so with my dignity intact
she is good in this
you were right my heart pure and true
what
i love you
you know that
Chuckles
i love who you are
i do not know how you got there but i am glad you did
i am glad i did too' cause you are here with me
Meager means indeed
Mmm
Come here
Harlot
Leave the dress
this dress is all i have
when i felt like i was nothing
it gave me strength and dignity
so no matter what happens to me
or where my life takes me
i will wear this dress and i will be fine
Sighs
i read your book
Did it help
it did when i sold it
Cans popping
how you doing
Better now
i had such a crummy day
yeah
uh huh
Well i think it is about to get worse
Why
Sighs
i have something i need to tell you my love
is a young love
but i know we will get this rightFlLMEXPORT HOME VlDEO Presents

Why this place

there was an open position here
and now i am slowly getting a feeling for it why
Well
oh
Amsterdam
Ok have to rush
Sorry
Bye
Polish
Herold Please let me ask you to write down a word
a short sentence on the cards been given to you by Sven
it is all about to find a place which came to your mind
in Birkenau and Auschwitz something in your memory
Emotion yes some feeling you had visiting the memorial
and please let me ask you to concentrate on one feeling
and with Wish please make a wish or a short sentence
for the future after you have left the memorial
Silence
Anybody wants to start
Anybody at all
it is all voluntarily
Nobody has to do this
yes i can start
so i chose the place hmmm the room with the suitcases from block six
Hmm there was this cupboard with lots of suitcases
my guess is a thousand or some
and each of them had a name on it
the prisoners and some also the priso or the detainee's number
Good
Sven would you please pin this here
as place i chose the children's clothing that was in block six as well
Jonas mentioned this already
there was a cabinet
with a small jacket
some small trousers Baby socks a rattle
that made me feel very emotional
as Emotion i chose helplessness
and as Wish i want
that this terrible times never shall be forgotten

Questions and answers now
Mrs Schneider
hello Mr Dremmler
hello
this is our history witness
Mr
Krzeminski
hello Mr Krzeminski
i am very sorry that i could not make it to your lecture
i had to listen to the Reports by our trainees
and they are very impressed
this discussion will stay with them
a lifetime
it is only a story
oh no
this is an encounter
and this will stay with them
Please
Thank you
no we have to thank you
for my trainees and for myself this is an exciting beginning
in our new operation here in Oswiecim
i am positive the few weeks here will be unforgettable and
an important part of your training
i wish to say thank you Once again
that we had the chance to listen to your story
and i am confident that we will Hear some interesting questions
Steffi can you please begin
what did you eat in the camp
we have eaten everything
Leftovers from the swine feeders
there was no grass left
Between the barracks
i stole bread crumbs from my neighbor
by day and by night
we have been dreaming of food
yes please
Did he also get a Number in the camp
he wants to know wether you got a number tattoo in the camp
all of us
have got a number
Eh
would it be possible that you show it to us
of course
Almost gone
did not have it renewed
Hey boy do you wanna go with us
what is up
do you come along
where to
Surprise
i simply do not know what i want to do
what
i am not sure what i want to do later
it is just like that
this is the good thing about this civil thing because it gives me a year to contemplate
yes this may be good
i believe Something's gonna happen you know
but there must be something you Really want to do right
no
Everybody has got that
Like a dream
Dream
no
Maybe one or two all my friends the girls from my grade
they push buggies into church and then they pick up their
Drunken husbands from the bar
i simply do not want to do this
that is your dream
yes the nightmare
my nightmare
and Krzeminski talks about his camp life
but the trainees really do not know what they should ask him
he gets this envelope from the manager and says thank you for a thousand times
she hasn't been there has no idea but show off like being so deeply impressed
and how bad it all has been
she doesn't need to know anything about history all that matters is business
Why
at least they will invest here in this place
and this is good is not it
without the factory all people Including Krzysztof
would not have a job
Krzysztof is working in the factory
yes
not all can depend on the camp
the tourists come in the morning
and then they leave for Warsaw or they go to Krakow
Ok but i do not really believe they will invest
they come that is globalization they come to this place press out the juice

i want to ask you a favor
in a few days the German trainees will put up a memorial stone at Monowice
it is from Rhon Chemie who supports us here too maybe you could take care of the project
Sure
you should read up on the historical background a little and assist them when they are there
no problem
have you been there yet
no
it was a subcamp for forced laborers at IG Farben
Come on
it is nice here
this is Monowice
Auschwitz ill
what was
where
all over here
yes
this was the camp street where you are riding now
and the barracks were over there where the houses are now
yes
Wild
it looks like a normal village
Wait
Look at this
they want to put up the memorial here
how many prisoners were here
what
how many prisoners were here
around 30 000
Come on Sven
no tours today
Look here
a Bunker Come on
the subject bothers you
but how is it for you
i am sorry
i mean
you lived here all your life and
so
is it commonplace for you to ride through Monowice or is it somehow
yes but i i was born here
i live here
my life is here
yes i know but
you live where humanity's greatest atrocity took place
you are living here now too
how do you feel about it
you are German
what do you think
i do not understand the question
should we go
Want to go see a movie
you would not understand a word
so what
Maybe another time
okay
but
i do not understand
Preserve
not repair
this is the most important Basic principle
Conserve not repair
he is never been to university
Somebody's gotta talk with him
i cannot take responsibility any longer
he is not gonna get any Suitcases any longer
no more suitcases
what
it is over
i do not understand
Why no more suitcases
i do not know either
they said something like there are problems at the moment it is going slowly
they need to look into it
i do not know
i didn t understand the whole point of it
Just as well
some time off
you can visit your family
or drink a beer with colleagues
Horse betting
do not bother me with that
Good Morning
yes
hello
Everything's alright with the suitcases
oh yes
i will be on my way
Alright fine
Stay still
can you wet this
do not move
Hold this
Face towards me
are you able to patch this ah
Look at me
can you cut the bandage and pull it out
Thanks
do you need more
yes
what happened
nothing
do not be childish
you hurt me
Just leave me alone you idiot
i have lost my job
Why
Germans kicked me out
they are firing people
Damn it
what should i do
do not worry about it
i am fed up with this
i will let you be
Wait
we are a little late everyone's here already
they won't start without me
Mr Krzeminski
Good morning
how nice of you to join us
Mr Friedrich one of our board members
he came from Germany especially for this
on behalf of my company thank you for your time
Good morning
Good morning
you already know our mayor
Good morning Mr Krzeminski
we are ready then
we can start
the prisoners feared the selections the most
Right here where you are standing
on this roll call area
the SS medics used to decide in a matter of seconds
on life and death
i saw the bored faces of the doctors
Quite often
they felt uncomfortable
Just looking at us
they only judged us
Based on our value to them
Thank you Mr Krzeminski
Thank you for your talk
okay we can take the picture
Thanks
Mr Krzeminski come please
no sorry
i think it is better if you'd come over here
it is always very tiring for him
Fine
we will take the picture without him
what a remarkable man this Mr Krzeminski
what goes on in the mind of such a person
Well maybe you should have let him finish
i thought his talk was losing impact
what impact
he should just talk some
he can decide on his own for how long
not everyone has the strength to deal with the past
like you do
i think what you do is good
you work here
do you know Krzysztof Lanuszewski
he works for you
a friend of yours
yes he s Polish
about my age
yes you just fired him
i know him well
Just like back then
Thrown away when of no value
he came too late or not at all
our plant cannot accept this
and your comparison is tasteless
no no Krzystof you should have told me why you lost your job
you know one minute ago i am standing with Mrs Schneider talking about you
it is not about Schneider
i want to help him
who asked you to get involved
you saw how they treated him
Schneider is a real bitch yes She s a bitch
Why the sudden interest in Krzeminski
he was in the Camp
Let him talk
that is not the problem
you are the problem idiot
you are the problem Idiot
Calm down
you are not my mother ok
i am really fed up with this
i have had it
i am leaving
i am done
Thanks a lot

and

here is some water
it is fine
It s fine
Leave me alone

It s fine
Leave me alone
it is okay
Go
what happened
what i missed the most was not having cigarettes
but if you pass out like that nobody'd know
It'd take forever for someone to come by
it is not right
i am still functioning
everything is okay
you came
by chance
i brought cigarettes for you
if i had not
Maybe you are right
can you call my sister
a man like me is not needed anymore around here
Well i do believe that you are needed here
for youth groups for example
and for the people you talk to
it is like
it is quite different is not
Show them Schindlers Liste
that has more impact
is the suitcase ready
yeah ready
Na
the boss asked me where i come from and when i told him they looked at me uneasily
everyone
Maybe that is why they chose me
Nonsense
i do
i do not think so
no
what
and i had to sign right there the same evening
i had to sign all documents
it was strange
a few signatures take me away from here
yeah
Please do not do that
what
what is wrong
Hey
Talk to me i do not understand you
yes i know
how can i explain it
i do not want that
Say what is on your mind
i am gone in 2 weeks
You re gone in a few months
and it is different for you
you do not know what you want to do
you are waiting for what comes
that has nothing to do with it
yes it does
i have only one chance to get away from here do you understand
and i want to go away
i would like to apologize for Sven's behavior and hope that this transgression does not impair our good relations
i will make sure that this does not get repeated
Krzeminski's work with the department
is honored but we are part of a museum
we have to consider every single piece
Mr Herold excuse me but it is obvious that his work is being taken away
it is his job
Sven it is enough
it is important to him
Enough
who says sensitive place
are you deaf
i am sorry Mr Krzeminski
Mr Krzeminski
i am really sorry
i know i should not have lied to you

you wanted Dad's old car so you took that too
and now Grace
i got news for you
you can not have her' cause she is mine
Excuse me
it was just one night
oh really
Just one time
Actually two times one night
Ugh

Tell me
will where do the batteries go
no wait
you are angry
do not answer that
will
will
i said i am sorry
you do not have to get all possessive and controlling okay
i am not possessive and i am not controlling
it is just that Sam can not have you' cause you are mine
oh stupid me
i have been living my life under the illusion
that i am my own person
i am outta here
you are blowing this out of proportion
yeah
and you betrayed me
and the fact that you do not understand where i am coming from just makes it worse
i think that went well
can you believe that
she is mine
Like he owns me
who died and made him the Sultan of Brunei
Honey what is goin' on with your hair
Looks like you got mousse and squirrel in there
you should talk
Mulan
Well all right

Bu bu bu bu bu bu bu bu bu bu bu bu
Shh
how do i put this delicately
um
i think you went with Sam because he is the will that will touch your boobies
what
what
what
what are you telling me
you think i slept with Sam because he is the straight version of will
that is ridiculous
Karen
Karen
i slept with Sam because he is cute Like will
and smart Like will
and funny Like you think will is
Stop it
this had nothing to do with will
Honey
i am not judging you
every woman likes to have her boobies touched now and then right
Stop saying boobies
okay okay
now you could not be more wrong
you have lost your mind
you live a very odd life
i do not know what who are you
Boobies
Hey no muddy paws and no surprises on the carpet
Klaus von Puppy is clean and housebroken thank you very much

will versus Life
you have heard
i have heard
Come on
Tiny Dancer talk to me
i got eyes to see ears to listen with and a head to nod knowingly
Go ahead caller you are on the air
it
it just pisses me off that he thinks he can come into my life and just take whatever he wants
and expect me to be happy for them
Well
i am not
Well you should not be
she is yours
Thank you
so many relationships i have been in have ended because the other person did not realize that they belonged to me
yes
what
no
i think it is a little different between Grace and me and you and your insignificant others
no it is not
Owning is owning
you own Grace
Just like i own you
Klaus
is not that right
i tell him when he eats when he goes out who he sniffs and when he needs a pedicure just like you and Grace
that is not what i meant
you know
i
i know i do not own Grace and she can sniff whoever sh
Leave me alone
Jack
all right you know what caller
Let me go out on a limb and say one more thing
Maybe you are upset because you are jealous of Sam
what
Clearly you wish you were the one who was sleeping with her
that is nuts
Nuts like a fox
will
Come on admit it
Part of you wishes that you could have Grace in that way hold her in your arms kiss her smell her woman's scent
Iet your hands slide down the back
Ugh
Forget it
i am sorry i said that
Ellen honey we are gonna need some Pepto
i do not know how the heteros do it with the hoo hoos and hee hee
i do not either
Jack
and one day

Final thought you are jealous
Maybe not of the icky sex part but of the fact that your brother shares a part of Grace that you never will
do not you agree

Maybe it is the Home Jumping Channel
Why

Arin has had sex with 3 people
it was really short and not long enough for me to get anything out of it
it just confirmed for me what i have really always known about myself
i was telling everyone i met that it was so sad how no one in my entire life had ever given me a lily
Well he left a lily on my doorstep which was nice
and i have this rule that if i have sex with somebody well they have to eat my pussy
and he tells me that he promised his mom that he would not have oral sex without protection
he confessed that he hadn't had sex in 3 years which explains a lot
i do not know
it was weird
Well actually uh he was still a virgin
i guess he thought it was gross that i was pregant eventually i just told him that i did not even know if i was pregnant so we went ahead which actually consisted of him messing around with uh messing around with the condom for about 5 minutes and then it lasted maybe 15 seconds and David and Johnny were still denying that Sarah was their baby and i was still waiting for Shawny to get out of the army because we had made all these plans to move in with each other so that is what i did
but yeah with Arin i mean that was it
i just moved in with Arin because
i had been kicked out of my apartment
cat fighting meows
i am 5 foot 8 123 pounds blond hair blue eyes
i won the Stahl Star award in 2nd grade and again in 5th grade

i went on to get a BFA in painting and then i moved to this lovely city where i currently reside pursuing an artist career

DEAR ARTlST COME TO STUDlO VERMONT
PLAY VlDEO
Studio Vermont Residency
my friends lover died and left him this farmhouse which we have since knocked down and we created the main hall and we decided hey lets create a home where people could create outside of all the chaos of the city a lot of people think that they can go to work and work their 9 to 5 and come home and throw some paint on a canvas and that is art it is not
Car horns noise sounds static chaos it is impossible to create with that environment
Suzanne has a lot of shame uh regarding some issues with her father
we are going to work through those things
i am glad you are here
i am glad to be here
Let's go
we will see you next week
3 2 1
Again
some of the magentas come down here and get some magenta
my whole life i doubted everything
Right into the canvas
Put it into the canvas
it is your mother
i doubted every creative impulse and what i try to do here is honor every impulse that every one of the artists has
what do you see in the dark i need words no but it is hurts
Words
i see freedom
FREEDOM
See
it works every time
look what we have freedom
it never fails never fails
we always get results here
he is come such a long way you can not even believe it
what we try to do here is get the artist to love their work we give them space to create new space to create new ideas new thoughts
Whether it is modern art expressionism post modernism what i hope is that your truth is in there somewhere
love it be careful of the orifice here that you have created
at Studio Vermont we provide a blank canvas for the mind completely blank where you can create from your core
Come join our haven
Come to Studio Vermont
1 month artist program
and then i said come in and he comes in with his lab coat on
Right and like he is pretending he is a doctor and he comes over to the bed and i am in bed and he is like what seems to be the problem and i am like who are you and he is like doctor Butler and i am like oh my god
this beautiful like red velvet thing
i said honey please can have that please let me fuck you with this thing on and he is like okay you know i will get it for you
so he is like so he is like'you're expensive'
i am like ewww and it is only going to get worse
Maybe have an affair
do you think i should i do
with women
Did you love Hawaii
i had a great time and you know on these assignments everything is paid for your treated like royalty
you lucky duck you lucky duck excuse me we are ready to order
so what do you think we should do should we get the mac and cheese and split it and then maybe get a salad

Let's just get one salad and split it get two separate plates

stop by my work
i am taking a shit at this girls work oh man this was a bad idea
i am getting a migraine
Subject stalking Susan
Dear Stalker
it is exciting knowing that you could at any moment be watching me
it feels like there a reason to be more aware and paying attention to what is around me
i think we should meet
those pictures wow
i know
i mean getting them was really exciting it must have been for you to yeah you know i mean it is really just exciting
a typical date at this point would not do justice to the stalking experience
we need to think of an another unique scenario
something challenging
anti date
i think it'd be really cool to not have a typical date
what if we made a rule to not speak
Let's just avoid the whole larynx exercise
do you like movies
i like movies
have you seen Schizopolis
yeah that was cool
what kind of music do you like
all kinds
do you like sports
not really me neither
and still meet up
wherever and communicate in any other medium as long as it is not speaking
and just see what happens
so why
so why did you move to New York
in college the people around me were really into nature
but i was bored and wanted to be challenged
Living in Italy was totally inspiring
made a ton of drawings
after high school i decided to focus on music
but i took the band more seriously than they did
Hey Ladies if anyone would like to fuck me i will be over at the bar after the show
then i started a production company
we should turn the warehouse into a video production studio
and we could shoot that music video for your band
but we ended up having to work on crappy projects for money
i felt like i had to get out of California
you can not leave what am i supposed to do about these ten wedding videos
Arin no
you are not taking computers
i wanted to find people with more ambition
but i feel like i still haven't made any progress
Ricky's Bar Mitzvah
Whoa you got the projector working
hi i am Susan
it is a pleasure it is a real pleasure
Likewise
Banana or yogurt snack
from
Susan it was cool not talking to you
from
Crumley Arin can we do that again
from
Susan lets
googling
STD
DlSTRlCT HEALTH CENTER
i went to a free clinic
i met this girl we hung out and we watched a movie and i only had sex with three girls before
that looks like folliculitis
nothing to worry about
Think of it as your skin reacting to unfamiliar body fluids
Just leave it alone
it will go away
although one of the bumps did look a little different
Meaning
Wait here the nurse will do a scrape test
Under the microscope that bump looked herpetic
Herpetic
okay
i have herpes
Listen the test is not 100 percent
i mean it could be Herpes 1 or Herpes 2
what is the difference okay
what is the fucking difference the difference okay Herpes 1 it is very common 90 percent of the population has it in their blood so do you ever get cold sores
yeah
there you go you have it
Herpes 1
Herpes 1 usually is on the mouth but can spread to the genitals
Herpes 2 is usually in the genitals but it can spread to the mouth
there is no difference except Herpes 2 is believed to increase a woman's chance of cervical cancer and Herpes 2 is much more infamous
she would've told me if she had this
Maybe she has the virus but has never had an outbreak or maybe she did not notice if she did or maybe she just failed to mention it that happens all the time or maybe you had a cold sore at one point and gave this to yourself
Great
i have herpes
Listen this is not the end of the world it is just a skin virus what is with you people you act like your life is over if you want you can spend a bunch of money on a blood test to confirm
Confirm this is not conclusive
Listen to me i said under the microscope it looks herpetic
that could mean anything
okay what does it likely mean
you have herpes
i am clean
have you ever had unprotected sex
yes but i have been tested
i think we should be Platonic
accepted
from Crumley Arin where are you can we meet
message deleted
Hey boss
we hang out had an awesome time seemed to loose interest
what do you think Susan
after school we talked about moving to Kentucky together and having a life there maybe buying a farm or
i do not know
then she went to Europe she said
i did a lot of bad things though
i broke her door down and furniture in her apartment
there was this one time i bashed my Gibson on the fucking stage
i am never gonna hurt you again pieces everywhere
i got a new guitar
Same as this one
i just wanted to love you you know
i am in such a better place now
OOOooaaaghh and i am getting better
i hit you in the arm you fucking bitch you fuck
we must take our angry feelings and we must turn them into light
Fucking cunt because if we can do that everything else everything else just kind of falls into place one day at a time
Simple
Easy does it
i was her first she was my first
we were everything
you get that intense
there is no going back
i mean that that was our love letter
how much more romantic can you get than a restraining order
Restraining order
Top of the page big print
Means you really do not talk to me about having sex any more until you have had your sex on your English teacher's desk after school
you know people talk
Sex in the middle of the gym
People say things
Sex behind your best friend's house
and those crazy sons of bitches they say crazy things
you travel somewhere too fast and do not have anywhere else to go
her parents did not like me even before i hit her
but that is the way that we loved each other
they just had a problem with me
that is love
and yes
i beat her up
Split her hip gave her a black eye
Vandalized her parents' cars vandalized her car
Caused like three thousand dollars worth of damage
Did you love her
Restrain me
you are going to try to restrain me
i will restrain you
i will strain you
yeah
you see you can love someone like that
ReSTRAlN you
it is too strong
it was intense
Restrain you
Order you
Restraining order
that is right
that is me
here is your studio
Number one
voice on phone Clinic yes we do blood testing
door opens Susan
you can ah come on back
reads Play this tape
Thanks for getting a test
so you are in Vermont
how is that going
so
i finally started something but i think it kind of sucks
i am keeping busy until some better ideas hit
they are really big here on like focusing here on raising your awareness and your consciousness and you know putting me in touch with my infinite possibilities
i am going to learn to express from my core
while i am here i am going to do the book the Artist's Way that my mom bought for me last Christmas
i have already started writing three pages in the morning to empty the contents of my mind
Paint from paint from the spray cans is going to drip into the water colors
Pencil drawings will be layered on top which will be whited out and spray painted over once again
and then i will draw in marker on top of it once it is dried
when i burn the edges it is going to make it say that my art is full of decay and that i am finished
we do not just have fears for no reason at all
you have them because you should legitimately be afraid
People are naturally afraid of heights because you really can fall and die
i am not trying to accuse you i just i do not know
this is crazy but i have this weird idea that there is people out there and it can not possibly be you but that there are people that have something and there is some sort of weird spite to the world purposely give that to others
i am not saying that that is you i am just looking for information to show that it is not
i was wondering if you could tell me honestly if you have had any symptoms recently or ever
because i really find it hard to believe that you have never had anything weird whatsoever strange happen down there at all
i do not feel accused except for the fact that i am obviously being accused
and no i do not have any symptoms and i will get my test results back in a couple weeks
i think it is probably pretty obvious to say this but i do not think we should have had sex
at the time of course
Right
i was thinking we should not have sex
Right
i mean that is why i was so surprised when you hopped on top of me
you asked me to have sex
in that note
is this a joke
i have the note right here
Oral comma condom question mark
i was asking if you wanted to have oral sex with a condom
i thought you were giving me options
i mean i have never heard of oral sex with a condom
i thought you meant oral sex or sex with a condom
i opted for something i thought we would both enjoy
i have never had sex with somebody more than once because it just goes so bad
i think they they are just um ready to move on
that is what blew me away about being with you is that for once it was an experience
it was an event that was like a major breakthrough for me
i did not want to not tell you what i was going through you know i did not want to just be experiencing that and just create a blockade rather than confronting you and it was better than just never speaking to you again in my mind
Full Disclosure Presentation for Arin
God
i really have to think about it
okay there is not someone since
Jason Rob Vincent Mark Jay Chris Steve agh
Let's see
Claudio
the bus boy at work but at least that was protected
there is a whole slew of people i just can not totally remember
the kid in my painting class the there was a friend of a friend then i got tested around that time and everything was fine
but still
if someone says they got something from me then maybe they did
now it just seems like such a ridiculous thing that i did not insist every time i had sex with somebody that we were going to use condoms
but i honestly just did not feel comfortable asking
so i just did not ask
i am getting my test results back soon
will let you know what is up
Susan
i will make you think this is weird
not this
this is definitely weird
but why do i still smell you
Even though you are like in three states away or whatever
it is almost like my B O smells like you
now
i noticed that ever since we were together
would that be like a scientific i mean can there be a reason behind that
or is it just my imagination
or did your smell somehow actually get left behind
it seems pretty strange to me
i made a copy of some video editing software that you can check out
and i have also written out some instructions that should help you get up to speed
i came here to find out if i was an artist
i did not create from my core
i did not stay in my truth
i did not make mixed media drawings
i did not paint
i did not draw
Given free time to do with which whatever i want i have done nothing scream
i am not an artist
laughs
i have no future
can you steam my broccoli with no olive oil and no butter
can i have a baked potato instead of mashed potatoes
can i get that with fat free dressing
can i please substitute
can i get that with cheese
do you have Harvey's
can i get creme brulee
no substitutions
it used to be on the menu
can i see
Grilled cheese with chicken
how much switch to fries
can i get greens instead of fries
i do not know what to say
this is the problem talking
you know you never get to say the things that you want to say
and then when you get the chance to say it words are not enough
so you just lock up
you do not say anything
that is when you hear sounds or worse you do not you hear just like some filler
something to take up the space
Fill in the gap that is there because you do not know how to say what you really want to say
Probably it can not be said
what i am really trying to say is
i like you
i haf ze good news of ze test back from the Herpes two and i no haf Herpes two
C L E a N
on one level time here in Vermont is flying by
but on another it is like time is moving so slow waiting to see you
if you appeared magically before me right now it would not be soon enough
could you bring the catsup over
no problem
Thanks
you are welcome
my feet are cold
my feet are cold
no offense but can you shut up
it ran out
you are not going to say anything
i do not need another boyfriend who controls me and this no talking thing is just a device to
i do not want to be controlled or harassed into modes of thinking in my analytical process
if you think of having to do things analytically and getting confused by other people's thoughts
i am sick of your imposing your thoughts and beliefs on me
i am sick of your reasons for wanting me to keep writing that you have avoiding me and trying to control me and you do not trust me
what are you trying to prevent
what are you trying to protect yourself from
Why do not you want to find out more about me
Why do not you want to get to know me
what are you afraid of
who are you trying to protect yourself from
Why do not you want to know me better
Why won't you talk to me
Why do not you trust me
crying what i was trying to say to you what i was trying shouts weeping i do not want Stop
Crying
Listen to me
Listen weeping Listen to me
shouting Listen to what i am trying to tell you
no
Jesus
you know when this was in storage the rats must have gotten into it
if we do not talk then we can just continue to
Invent ourselves
we can use these creative lubricants to help us find out who we are trying to be
Why should we be dealing with who we have been you know
that is pretty much irrelevant you know
i just feel like you are canning that experience
you are just stopping it dead in its tracks probably because maybe you are discovering things that you do not want to discover
Let's be honest with ourselves it is going to end you know it is just a question of how
you know
how our story ends
and it just seems before that happens we should try to experience more learn more from each other
i do not want to ruin what we have you know
it sounds like you are into this experiment and into this process but you are not really into me
Well you either click or you do not
i feel like my childhood left me with some serious abandonment issues
i am really smart
i have a great tight pussy
i can make lasagna
i guess because i have never felt that i was beautiful i would like him to think i was
i do not have any idea just i feel so lost
i want a man to say i love you
i am going to say something
i am going to film it
we have all all the writing Go all the way and the drawings and all the video to make this into something
is not this crazy
i do not think we should even ask ourselves questions like that
there is sort of like this compulsive nature to our relationship
for it to be in creation
i am not interested in arriving anywhere
i am interested in the process of getting there
we just never seem to resolve our problems i do not think anybody brings out in me what the hell is wrong with you except you honestly
it gets really fucked up sometimes we are faith in a relationship on the same page with you no discussion you say jump
i say how high i do not know what is going on inside my head it is the difficulty of executing this project it is kind it is feeling very familial part of the question is qo you want to do
i do not know if i want to let's not fight i want to be
i just want to say that we are gonna break up that is the big question it would be a lot easier than trying to make it work
Well congratulations
you have been selected for one of twelve narrative feature spots
how long have you been working on this film
a year
oh congratulations
i do just now and then kind of like lean off into this kind of question of
what is happening
what do you think is happening
there is never an end
you resolve a nice day
there is too many fucking weird little things to say to say we are ever sorry
as if there is no fucking other shit
do you understand what it feels like
such an asshole
Damn it
Damn it
Damn it
i am just making a decision on my own but it hurts
i hate it so much
i can not believe we are doing this
what will you are not going to say anything more
what do you want to get this i am totally i want to stop being so pissed off
Well i am compli listen Arin
and just be natural be present
Lean in
Y'know come on in
yeah okay
so less
yes
Like that
that is good
i will just fucking do it
Like i do not without all that
and i am talking to you right now
i will do whatever it takes to get this stupid fucking intro out there
all right
okay
so what do you want said
Let's discuss that so that it is crystal clear
are we going to be able to fix this relationship
are we going to be able to fall in love againthis is the Earth our planet
Home to millions of different species
but only one species dominates everything
Human beings
there are nearly seven billion of us living on the Earth
and the human population is increasing by more than two people every second
200 000 people every day
Nearly 80 million people every year
each additional life needs food energy water shelter and hopefully a whole lot more
Today we are living in an era in which the biggest threat to human wellbeing to other species and to the Earth as we know it might well be ourselves
the issue of population size is always controversial because it touches on the most personal decisions we make
but we ignore it at our peril
there is absolutely no doubt at all that the world's population will continue to grow
the only question is by how much
more than a billion people on the planet already lack access to safe clean drinking water
and we know things are going to get more difficult as the population continues to grow
we need to double the amount of food that we have available to us as soon as possible
such a scale of change will leave no one untouched
Keep in mind that when the Titanic sank the first class cabins went to the bottom just as quickly as the steerage
i was born into a world of just under two billion people
Today there are nearly seven billion of us
Whenever i hear those numbers i can honestly say i find it incredible
Triple the number of human beings in what seems like the blink of an eye and the world transformed utterly
Human population density is a factor in every environmental problem i have ever encountered from urban sprawl to urban overcrowding disappearing tropical forests to ugly sinks of plastic waste
and now the relentless increase of atmospheric pollution
i have spent much of the last 50 years seeking wilderness filming animals in their natural habitat and to some extent avoiding humans
but over the years true wilderness has become harder to find
i can not pretend that i got involved with filming the natural world 50 years ago because i had some great banner to carry about conservation
not at all
i have always had huge pleasure in just watching the natural world and seeing what happens
i made those films because it was a hugely enjoyable thing to do
but as i went on making them it became more and more apparent that the creatures which were giving me so much joy were under threat
the fun is in delighting in the animals
but if you do that you owe them something and so you have an obligation to speak out and do what you can to help protect them
i support a group called the Optimum Population Trust which campaigns to reduce birth rates
because i think if we keep on going we are not only going to damage nature we are likely to see more and more inequality and human suffering
in this programme i want to see how population growth will affect our ability to obtain our most basic needs water food and energy
and to see if it is possible to answer the question how many people can live on Planet Earth
Human beings are good at many things
but thinking about our species as a whole is not one of our strong points
i do not even think i could tell you how many people live in this country
a googol
yeah i would say a googol
TRANSLATlON
i know India's population is 1 1 billion but i do not know the population of the world
I'd say six billion off the top of my head
TRANSLATlON
i have got no idea how many people live on the planet no idea
Luckily the size of the human population is studied very closely
by and large every human birth and death throughout the world has been recorded for the last 60 years
the data is kept here in New York City at the United Nations
Hania Zlotnik head of the UN Population Division is in charge of those precious numbers
this was the old type of working when i arrived at the UN
i worked with these types of files
they are very well organised but they look old
now we do it via computer and it is somehow not the same thing as feeling the data
i am a numbers person yes definitely
' my mission is to be the bean counter'
that means we are the thermometer telling you that the planet is getting hot or cold in terms of population change
the UN do much more than just keep records
they make projections into the future
and their figures are staggering
the human population is still growing
one expects that at the very least it is likely to add about 2 3 billion people by middle of the century
we have 6 8 billion today
we are expecting to get the seventh billion in the next three to four years
and then that by mid century we will have something like nine billion
in the next 40 years the Earth will need to accommodate nearly three billion more people
that is more than the current population of the whole of Europe the whole of Africa North and South America combined
how can we be so sure of this prediction
Well we know that there are more than a billion teenagers alive today and most of those teenagers will have children of their own and live long enough to become grandparents
and that is all that needs to happen for there to be nine billion humans alive in 2050
it is not people having huge families
it is just a lot of people doing what humans naturally do
we also have a good idea of where these additional people will live
there are likely to be ten million more people in Britain
100 million more in the USA
India will overtake China to become the most populous country in the world
the population of some countries will shrink
Japan Russia Germany and much of Eastern Europe
the places that will experience the most rapid growth are also the least developed countries in the world
Afghanistan's population will double
most of Sub Saharan Africa will double
Niger's population is predicted to more than triple
i think everyone living through the next 50 years is going to be affected by these demographic changes wherever they are
for most of human existence our population size was kept in check by nature just as it is for other animals
if there is plenty of water food and materials for shelter a population will thrive
but when disease famine or drought strike life can be cut short
the history of humanity is one of overcoming these environmental limits but it took us a very long time to achieve
on the horizontal axis here we have time over the last 10 000 years
on the vertical axis here we have the size of the human population in billions of people
over the last 10 000 years in general there is been very little change
it is a very boring picture
but from about the year 1800 onwards you have a major increase a very large increase in the world's population from about 1 billion up to 7 billion today
Basically what this increase in population represents is control of death rates
Death rates have been reduced because infectious diseases cholera smallpox malaria measles those sorts of things have been massively reduced
on average for almost all of human history a man and a woman were only survived into adulthood by two of their children and that is why the world's human population did not increase
Extending life by controlling disease is perhaps one of the greatest achievements of humanity
i was born into a world of 2 5 billion and i am seeing it almost triple in my lifetime
and life has not gotten worse
in fact for most of the population of the world
life has gotten better in these 50 years
Living healthily and long has consequences population growth
Just as the human population was starting its unprecedented growth spurt in the late 18th century this was published
it is a first edition of an Essay on Population by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus
Malthus made a very simple observation about the relationship between humans and resources and used it to look into the future
he pointed out that the power of population is indefinitely greater
than the power in the Earth to produce subsistence for man
Food production can not increase as rapidly as human reproduction
Demand will eventually outstrip supply
Malthus goes on to say if we do not control human reproduction voluntarily
life could end in misery which earned him a reputation as a bit of a pessimist
but Malthus's principle remains true
the productive capacity of the Earth has physical limits and those limits will ultimately determine how many human beings it can support
to help answer that question we need to have an idea of what human beings need
and the people who calculate this more precisely than most are the people who are more interested in leaving the planet than staying on it
Astronauts
one of the people in charge of the wellbeing of astronauts on the International Space Station is Doug Hamilton
NASA we calculate and simulate everything
if you are going to plan a rocket launch you have to know how much food and water and equipment you need to bring into space
as well as working out how much space the astronauts need
Doug and his team have to calculate their daily requirements for food water and breathable air
they typically need about 820 grams of oxygen which is just a really large large balloon really
we need about 4 000 to 5 000 calories of food which is about 820 grams dry and they need about 3 52 litres of water of which 2 5 litres is just consumed daily
we want them to drink a lot of water it is very good for them
and then we urinate out and put that into our processing system and we make it into drinkable water so you might be drinking the same water molecule hundreds and hundreds of times on the space station because we recycle
NASA's calculations are tailored for space but they are the same ingredients each and every one of us needs
when you see how hard it is to reproduce what Mother Nature does every day for all of us you begin to really appreciate the world that you have
Whatever our technological achievements we are still utterly reliant on the natural systems of the Earth for our very survival
by and large the planet has provided for the human race so far
as the population has increased people through agriculture and industry have exploited those resources ever more effectively
but increasingly we are seeing signs of strain
we are reaching the limits of our environment
Perhaps most alarmingly with that fundamental ingredient for life water
we call our Earth the Blue Planet because about 70 of the Earth's surface is covered in water
but most of that is sea just 2 5 is fresh water
and of that tiny fraction just 1 is available for human use
the rest is locked up in mountain glaciers and the Earth's polar ice caps
but there is another fact we need to understand about water
Well there is no more water on the planet than there was when life first appeared on Earth
it changes its distribution
there is more water in different parts of the world
but its still the same amount of water that is been here always
we appropriate over half of all the available fresh water in the world to serve our needs
to transform deserts into fields
to generate energy from rivers
and to build cities in some of the most arid regions on the planet
but despite our ingenuity there are many who struggle to get enough of this basic resource
more than a billion people on the planet already lack access to safe clean drinking water
and we know that things are going to get more difficult as the population continues to grow
within the next 20 years as much as half of the world's population will live in areas of water stress
Chronic water shortages are often the result of poor infrastructure politics poverty or simply living in an arid part of the world
but increasingly the pressures of population are to blame
Mexico City is ranked as the eighth richest city in the world ahead of Moscow Hong Kong and Washington DC
it also benefits from heavy annual rainfall
but its water system is buckling under the pressure of supplying water to its 20 million inhabitants
and every day at least a million people are affected by the shortages
Enrique Vazquez is a water truck driver for the government
and the number of people relying on this emergency service is growing daily
Today he is heading for a poor district in the city's south west where he is a regular visitor
TRANSLATlON
at some time in the future wars are going to be fought over water not oil
but people do not seem to understand
instead of conserving it we just waste it
the problem is a combination of leaks in the system and back up reservoirs that are running dry
the city authorities predict that these reservoirs may be completely emptied within a matter of months
TRANSLATlON
Look the tap's on but there is no water coming out
the people living here have had to adapt their lifestyles to an erratic water supply
we only have half a bucket of water to wash ourselves with
and we can not flush the toilet until two or three people have used it
TRANSLATlON
Unfortunately i think there is going to be water shortages all over the world not just in Mexico City
i think everyone needs to take water more seriously
the few people who have water should conserve it better or there will come a time when the shortages are global and there is little left for anyone
in Mexico City shops which sell water to meet people's daily needs are becoming ever more common
but the water we use at home is only a fraction of the water we actually consume
and that is because we use colossal quantities in industry and agriculture
we may know where the water out of our tap comes from but we seldom know where the water that went into our can of cola or into the shirt we are wearing where those goods were produced and how much water it required what the consequences were for the natural systems and local communities that are dependant on that same water
so for example the cup of coffee you may have in the morning requires on the order of 120 litres just to produce the coffee and bring it to your table
a can of beer 150 litres
a hamburger 8 000 litres of water
to produce enough water to grow the cotton in my shirt is 3 000 litres as well
the impact of human demands on the world's freshwater systems are so massive they can be seen from space
the Aral Sea a freshwater lake in Central Asia once covered 65 000 square kilometres
in the last 40 years it has lost 90 of its water the rivers that feed it diverted to irrigate cotton
Lake Chad on the southern edge of the Sahara has also been drained to a tenth of its former size by drought and overuse
Yet 30 million people depend on it
it is possible to distil fresh water from the sea
and in the last 20 years more and more countries have turned to desalination
but with current technology desalination plants are often extremely expensive use an enormous amount of energy and their by products can be damaging to our seas
with groundwater levels declining across the world from North Africa to China
Pollution of rivers and wetlands on the increase and already today more than 1 2 billion people living with water scarcity our prospects for providing water to nearly three billion more people do not look good
but in many ways supplying water to people is the least of our worries
as we have seen the lion's share of the water we use goes into agriculture
and that means any water shortages we face in the future will affect our ability to provide that other staple of life food
when it comes to the world's food supply some of the most accurate information comes from space
Geographer Molly Brown monitors food production on Earth using data from NASA's satellites
this is a ecosystem in Thailand where they do rice agriculture and it is extraordinarily productive and in one of the most highly productive agricultural regions
now she is beginning to see global agriculture hit a natural limit
one of the things that all these different landscapes really show us is how we are using almost all the land that is available to us that is really highly productive that has great agricultural potential
so we know that there is not a lot of extra land
i mean we are using 30 or 40 of the entire land surface
as the world's population increases the urgency with which we are going to have to increase the amount of food we produce will increase
so we need to double the amount of food that we have available to us as soon as possible
how we are going to do that is through raising productivity because there is really no more land with which to expand to
a doubling of productivity sounds ambitious but we have done even better than that in the past
in the 20th century the industrialised nations managed to triple their farming yields with the invention of synthetic fertilisers and then by the introduction of mechanised processes
the less developed parts of the world continued using traditional farming methods into the 1960s until an Iowan farmer decided to do something about it
Norman Borlaug who died this year aged 95 is credited with saving millions of lives in what is become known as the Green Revolution
so he was a very unpretentious man
you can see from his office
Small but very functional
and he had some of his awards on the wall
but also in particular i always thought this picture which he kept on the wall was quite typical of the kind of person he was
his interactions with the next generation of scientists around the world and his enthusiasm for getting out into the field and showing people what could be done with the science in improving agricultural productivity
Borlaug developed high yielding disease resistant crops and taught Indian and Mexican farmers how to get the most out of them with modern farming methods
the astonishing five fold increases in yield that they achieved allowed many countries to become self sufficient in food
in 1970 Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in alleviating world hunger
he was able to get his wheat his new varieties delivered to India and within a few years it was really astounding
he showed me pictures of the mounds of wheat the surplus that had been produced within a few years of introducing these new varieties
and in fact that is the seminal event that is the Green Revolution
Thanks in part to Borlaug much of the world is now fed but globally we are beginning to see a levelling off of agricultural yields
this is leading to a worrying new trend
to maintain their own food supplies some of the richest and most powerful countries in the world are acquiring large tracts of land from some of the very poorest
Olivier De Schutter is a human rights lawyer who is been monitoring these land deals for the United Nations
Arable land suitable for cultivation is becoming a scarce commodity and countries find it more and more difficult to produce enough food to feed their populations
so they are now scrambling in a global competition to achieve food security by buying land abroad
International corporations and increasingly governments are leasing some of the last remaining areas of un developed farmland in the world
their aim is to introduce intensive farming methods and export the food back to their home countries
the problem is that in most cases these deals are not sufficiently well monitored
they are not transparent and we are not certain that local communities will benefit from these investments
These deals are often controversial and shrouded in secrecy
but according to local media reports
Chinese investors are negotiating land deals throughout Africa as well as with Kazakhstan Mexico and Brazil
Saudi Arabian firms have leased farmland in Sudan
and several British investment funds are reported to be raising capital to buy farmland in Angola Malawi and Ukraine
most of the target countries for foreign investors are in Africa some of which already struggle to feed their own people
when we see paradoxical situations such as foreign investors producing food in Ethiopia shipping this food back to the home country or selling it on the international markets when Ethiopia is still a country which is heavily dependent on international food aid
so this is a country which is at the same time producing food for export markets and depending on international aid in order to feed its population
the future is going to be particularly challenging for the countries of sub Saharan Africa
with many of their populations projected to double there is going to be increasing pressure for a limited supply of land
there are few nations as acutely aware of how destabilising these kinds of pressures can be as Rwanda
our land is not growing and yet our population is
we estimate that it will be double in 26 years so in 26 years we will probably be 20 million
Rwandans consider land a vital resource
but they also see it as a resource for primarily their own use for their own security for their own food security
Martin Seturinka grows bananas and maize on three acres of farmland
Like 80 of Rwandans his family subsist on what they can grow
Land is an issue all over Rwanda
there is not enough land to go around and people find it hard to grow enough food to survive
in Rwanda children inherit land from their parents but in a country where the average family has more than five children that can only mean one thing
Smaller parcels of land to live off
i do not know what will happen to my children or how they will cope i honestly do not
it is already impossible for me to provide enough food for them
Only God knows
Martin is father to 15 children
but they are not all his own
Five of them are adopted orphans whose parents were brutally murdered in Rwanda's devastating genocide
in 1994 the two major tribes in Rwanda the Hutus and Tutsis embarked on a mutual slaughter that left almost a million dead in just three months
Amongst the many causes of that conflict competition for scarce resources was an added pressure
Poverty became a mobilising tool the poor unemployed youth some of them were encouraged to kill their neighbours with the hope they'd either inherit their piece of land or their house or their livestock
if we cannot grow the economy fast enough to meet this growth and can not slow it down then there will be increased competition for resources which are finite
so our forests are likely to go our swamps will be overused
therefore this will also have an effect on the climate climatic changes which will further exacerbate the negative effects of this growth
it is a bit of a vicious cycle and we must find a way of breaking it
in Rwanda the government can already foresee the impact population growth is likely to have on their immediate environment
across the world population growth is likely to take an even greater toll because of our ever increasing demands for a resource we have come to depend on but which may be causing us the biggest damage of all
of all the resources that humans have harnessed from the Earth the one that has transformed everything is energy
Fossil fuels are the remains of plants and animals that lived perhaps 350 million years ago and later became buried in the Earth's crust
with the technologies of the industrial age we liberated this energy and used it to get more from nature than had ever been possible before
our favourite fossil fuel is oil
our demand for it increases every year
Today we use 85 million barrels a day
Oil provides the fertiliser pesticide and mechanisation that has allowed us so far to produce enough food for our expanding population
but just as we are realising how much we depend on it it is getting harder to find
Houston Texas
one of the richest places in the world thanks to its vast reserves of oil and gas
Danny Davis is an independent oil producer
this is our office our base of operations and what we do
our little company sign which we are very proud of
Danny has been drilling oil in Texas since the early 1980s
this is a collection of jars of oil from all the wells we have found over the years i guess over the last 15 years
one of them i kind of like the most is this one
this was discovered about 30 minutes outside of Houston on the Brookshire Dome
this came out at 1 000 barrels of oil a day from 2500 feet
High gravity sweet crude
it smells great
when it comes out its so fresh you can put it on your salad
little oil and vinegar it is good stuff
this is why we do it this is what it is all about it is an exciting business
there is a fortune to be made treating these reservoirs
These days oil in Texas is getting harder to find
Danny's looking much further afield to Alaska
he is been granted a rare license from the government to drill offshore
but before he can get started
Danny needs to raise millions of dollars of investment
Let me ask you a question how many years you been doing this about 40 or 50
if his plans are successful the figures are truly staggering
you look at a billion of barrels of oil and oil's 70 a barrel and you got two billion barrels in gross numbers 200 billion dollars probably
i do not know i could not predict that
you can only go on the value today you do not know what it is is going to be tomorrow
yeah i will call him and let him know
Thanks for everything
all right guys
we will see y'all soon
Danny won't be short of customers for his oil because energy demand is predicted to increase by 40 over the next two decades
the Alaskan fields may make him a very wealthy man
but the fossil fuels that have helped to bring great wealth to many nations as well as individuals are proving to be a double edged sword
not just because of their contribution to climate change
what cheap energy has allowed us to do fundamentally is to appropriate the Earth's natural systems to serve our needs without paying too much attention to the long term effects on the environment and other species
it seems we are just beginning to realise the full impact that our industrialisation is having upon the natural world
in the oceans we have depleted fish stocks massively
10 of the world's coral reefs are estimated to be degraded beyond recovery
a third of the world's amphibians a fifth of all mammals and 70 of all plants are currently under threat of extinction
when it comes to conserving our natural world there are two arguments to contend with
on the one hand there is a sense of our moral obligation as the most intelligent species on the planet to protect the marvellous variety of species that have evolved alongside us
on the other there is self interest
the more we damage the environment the more we threaten our own survival
Perhaps self interest is the more powerful argument because how we treat our environment certainly determines how many people the Earth can sustain
there is a concept in ecology called carrying capacity
it is a calculation of how large a population any given environment can support
William Rees is a human ecologist who is taken the concept and applied it to ourselves and our environment the Earth
the simple fact of the matter is the Earth can accommodate so much consumption
you might have ten billion people at one level of living and a billion at a more comfortable level of living
so carrying capacity is a very flexible idea
you simply divide the total productivity of the Earth by the number of people and that gives you some idea of how many people the Earth can support
Rees has estimated what he calls the productive bio capacity of the Earth
this is made up of all the food water and energy produced across the world each year and measured in units called global hectares
he is worked out that if we were to share the Earth's productive bio capacity fairly there'd be two global hectares each
but the reality tells a very different story
According to Rees's data most of Africa use little more than half of their share of the Earth's productive capacity
the average Indian uses less than half
the Chinese use their fair allocation of two hectares each
but Europeans use much more with the British on average using over five global hectares
and the average American using more than four times their fair share
so how many people can the Earth sustain
Well according to these calculations if all humans consumed the same as the average Indian does today the Earth could sustain as many as 15 billion people
if we consumed as little as the average Rwandan this would go up to 18 billion
but our planet can only sustain 2 5 billion people
living as we do in Britain
and only 1 5 billion living in the lifestyle of those in the United States
but the picture may even be worse than this
These figures are based on rates of consumption that many think are already unsustainable
there is plenty of evidence right now that we are already in the state of what we call overshoot
each year the human population at current average levels of consumption which most of us in Europe and North America would consider to be inadequate is already exceeding the productive capacity of the planet
not only in terms of its ability to produce but also in terms of its capacity to assimilate our wastes
Rees believes that today's population requires the equivalent of 1 5 Earths to support our current way of life
we are simply living beyond the means of our environment to sustain us
to have a state of sustainability where we remain within the productive capacity of the planet means that people in industrialised countries are going to have to give up consumption of a great deal in order to create the ecological space for needed growth in the third world
if we do not make those kinds of compromises then we are going to continue to erode the resource base of the planet to the point where we all suffer
as i see it humanity needs to reduce its impact on the Earth urgently and there are three ways to achieve this
we can stop consuming so many resources
we can change our technology and we can reduce the growth of our population
we probably need to do all three
for most people the idea of someone else telling them how many children they should have is simply unacceptable
so when governments attempt to do exactly that it always causes controversy
in 1979 the Chinese government introduced its infamous one child policy changing family life in China forever
Families were encouraged to have fewer children those that did not were fined
the policy was a direct response to the preceding decades of famine and starvation
it is still in place today
According to official figures without the one child policy there'd be 400 million more people in China that is more than the entire population of the USA
it is unlikely that other governments could undertake such an extreme path without major civil opposition
in the 1970s the Indian government also sought to bring down its birth rate
to start with it took a less aggressive path setting up festivals around the country where vasectomies were offered in return for small incentives
in those days in those festivals they have done in a week something like 80 000 sterilisations
the incentive was some cash some money nothing much
the problem was the festivals were attracting the wrong customers people who already had large families
that is the weakness of incentivisation they could not attract the couples with two children they attract couples with five children six children
it is like closing the door after the horse has gone
but in some areas politicians took the sterilisation drive a step too far
in 1977 when Indira Gandhi was introduced the emergency programme
what they did the punishment for every crime in those days were sterilisation
for example if a person travels in a train he has no ticket what is the punishment
he was taken for sterilisation
in 1977 alone around eight million people were sterilised
and the public outcry was so great that it helped to bring down the government
Hopefully these kind of coercive policies are a thing of the past
because we are beginning to realise that birth rates fall provided the conditions are right
in the south west of India lies the long narrow coastal state of Kerala
most of its 32 million inhabitants live off the land and the ocean a rich tropical ecosystem watered by two monsoons a year
it is also one of India's most crowded states
but the population is stable because nearly everybody has small families
how many of you have only one child in the house
Raise your hands
Only one
you are the only one in the house
Only one
Only one
i think today almost 30 to 40 of couples in Kerala have just one child
how many of you have two in the house two
two
two in the house
Today on average Kerala women produce only 1 5 children
how many of you three in the house
Three three three
no problem brother or sister
two brothers
they wanted a girl
that is why they got three
otherwise no
you will rarely see a couple with now three children very rarely
at the root of it all is education
Thanks to a long tradition of compulsory schooling for boys and girls Kerala has one of the highest literacy rates in the world
Even too young children are coming to school
See they are carrying bags bigger than them
where women are well educated they tend to choose to have smaller families
when all girls goes to school automatically they will marry very late
for example today in Kerala average woman marries at the age of 28
Whereas a state like Uttar Pradesh Rajasthan Bihar the girl marries at the age of 18
so at 28 these women in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have already four children where Kerala girl is even not married
how many children do you want to have
ALL
one
what Kerala shows is that you do not need aggressive policies or government incentives for birth rates to fall
Everywhere in the world where women have access to education and have the freedom to run their own lives on the whole they and their partners have been choosing to have smaller families than their parents did
but reducing birth rates is very difficult to achieve without a simple piece of medical technology contraception
we can think of modern contraception as a crucial technology for the sustainability of the planet because it is the element that has allowed the populations of many developing countries to reduce their fertility as rapidly as they have done
despite a recent history that makes population a particularly delicate subject in Rwanda the government here is one of the few in Africa to have made universal access to contraception a national priority in recent years
Console Mukanyarwaya is one of hundreds of family planning officers who give contraceptive advice to local communities
since the year 2000 family planning education has been provided for everyone in the country
Rwandans understand that while it is wonderful to have children you have got to be able to look after them as well as you can
we try to get people who use contraception to teach their neighbours so they can see for themselves the advantages of having fewer children
since it has become freely available the uptake for contraception has been huge in Rwanda with many women opting for injections or even five year hormone implants
while Rwanda is addressing its population growth it is estimated that a quarter of married women in sub Saharan Africa still do not have any access to contraception
and across the world over 80 million births are unplanned
in my view it is a basic human right that everyone should have access to contraception
all the evidence is that people take advantage of this once they have the possibility and they reduce their fertility
if that happens then amongst other things the world's population growth will eventually level out at a lower rather than a higher number
and that is a good thing
when it comes to other ways of reducing human impact on the Earth there are a few glimmers of hope emerging
Governments across the world are beginning to recognise that the life support services provided by our ecosystems are in need of repair and they are doing something about it
often it takes individuals with vision to lead the process of change
Valente Souza is an urban planner and a committed environmentalist with a lot of responsibility
the government of Mexico City have employed him to find a sustainable solution to their water shortages
and he is convinced the local ecosystem holds the answers
the solution is at hand and the solution is called the rain
because we are at the top of the mountain and the only source of water is rain not rivers
we have to re establish what we call the hydrological cycle
this cycle relies on ancient forests that used to surround the city
but as the city's grown they have all but disappeared
and here you can see a water truck coming up
Souza's mission is to protect the remaining forests
Part of that is building walls to prevent soil erosion
Mexico City is surrounded by a rock like this with a forest on top
it rains the soil prevents it from running fast
it trickles inside all of these holes and the water comes out here on the valley of Mexico
and that is how Mexico City gets its water from from this rock which is like a doughnut around it
for this natural process to work it relies on a rich layer of topsoil
my hand is moist because this is saturated with water
if when it rains this gets saturated with water then the rocks have the time to get saturated with water because they have
they are slower at having water inside so you need this
the only way for us to have water down there is to catch it up here
if we lose the forest we lose the water
Souza is drawing up plans to conserve protect and replant the forests working with the local communities who own them
These people are the owners of this particular forest
it is private property
and instead of being farmers cultivating corn they cultivate trees
they call this a water forest
we are responsible for the forest
we must look after it
we make sure there is no illegal developments or logging
no pollution no rubbish
it is both our role and our duty
Even in the heart of a vast urban metropolis like Mexico City the intimate relationship between humans and the natural world endures
it seems to me that an understanding of the natural world is crucial for all of us
after all we depend upon it for our food for the air we breathe and some would say for our very sanity
it is a relationship that we are stretching to breaking point as we continue to grow in numbers
within the course of this programme the human population has increased by another 9 000 people
each one of them will be making their own demands on the Earth
we have to be using water and all of the other natural resources in a much more sustainable fashion
we have to quit wasting so much we have to quit polluting so much and if we do those things and if we put the science and the technology that is already available to us into play into implementation today then we have a chance to make it into the next 30 or 40 or 50 years and into a population of eight or nine billion
but if we do not start doing those things immediately we do not stand a chance
if current trends unfold the way some scientists think they will it will be a very different planet by the middle of this century
the temperature may be up to two or three degrees warmer
if that is the case food and most other resources are going to be scarcer
there will be eight or nine billion people here and the question our children are going to ask us is
if you saw this coming why weren't you able to do anything about it
i am very aware that this film could be seen as bleak and depressing
an increasing population with an ever decreasing supply of resources
but humans have capabilities that animals do not to think rationally to study and to plan ahead
the number of people on the planet in the future depends on the personal decisions we each make about how many children we have
Even setting aside the moral responsibility we have to protect other species if we continue to damage our ecosystems we damage ourselves
it is clear that we will have to change the way we live and use our resources
we are at a crossroads where we can choose to cooperate or carry on regardless
can our intelligence save us
i hope so

it is time Theseus
on your feet
Let's go
Chanting
Theseus
2077
my time
my city
my family
when terrorists killed thousands of innocents they were condemned to die
they had other plans
the time travel device sent us all back 65 years
i want to get home but i can not be sure what i will return to if history is changed
their plan
to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future
what they did not plan on was me

Elena was braver than me
Why do you say that
she made a life for herself in this time
Committed
Forged connections
you made connections
i know
that is odd
what is up
Hopefully nothing
someone removed Elena's body
what
how do you know that
the same way i know that your heart rate right now is 55 and your BP is 110 over 80
Right gotta get used to that chip in your head
Multi spectrum nano sensor array
it is
Why would somebody want to steal a corpse
Only someone that knew she was a time traveler would have done this
Whoever it was went through a lot of trouble to cover this up
Shit i gotta get to court
what are you gonna do
Bodies from the future being snatched
i have got an idea of two more that might be next in line
Excuse me
crash sounds
Agent Cameron
never sneak up on someone in the morgue it is like the number one rule
i am sorry
it is ok
you here about Jowarski and Chen
Ye
yes
do not worry it is all been taken care of
what is been taken care of
the paperwork
do not you guys communicate
Agent
Warren signed the bodies out yesterday
the bodies are gone
Shipped
Remind me
Agent Warren
Section Six
Carlos
Jim
Pretty tense around here
Lots of people still stunned by Julian Randol's sentence if you can call time served plus three months a sentence
Kinda hard to pin a terrorism charge on a kid driving a van full of empty barrels
it sounds like you sympathize
not at all
Julian Randol was willing to kill hundreds of people
Hopefully the attempted murder charge will stick
Maybe the only way this city gets any justice
he shot me
that is a fact
Shooting a cop carries heavy freight whether you kill him or just wound him
Excuse me
i let you down i know that
i can not change the past but i am here hoping to change the future
oh really
you are going to try and politic me
Carlos i want to win this
i see a way to bring the factions together to bring this city back together
the people want a mayor that works for their interests not his own
it is about trust
i will earn the respect
Well do not tell us
Show us
Alec
Shit
Did i interrupt something
i am about to revolutionize quantum computing with that little slice of heaven you gave me
someone claiming to be Section Six just took the two Liber8 bodies from the morgue
Jowarski and Chen
what
how
Elena's body has also been moved so please Alec
i need you to
is something wrong Agent Cameron
what do you want Gardner
Seems all the people in your life share your mysterious past and then vanish just as mysteriously
what are you talking about
Your friend Elena
i saw you and Carlos at the grave today it got me thinking
i am going to have my people recover the casket
you got a problem with that
no
it is a good idea
Really
yeah i had a feeling something was up so I'd like to know what you find out
that is it
now that you mention it someone impersonating Section Six was here
yeah no there is someone impersonating Section Six
i think you and i are just talking about different people
what a dick
oh yeah
Whoever it was illegally removed two Liber8 bodies from the morgue
Why do not you do yourself a favour and help out for a change
Help you
you might just find what you are looking for
uh
Kiera do you think that is wise
Laughs
Alright Cameron game on
Ah stay put
i need access to all your security footage
Come here
i do not know why you are letting Gardner help you
Give a dog a bone he will chew on it for hours
i am VPD
Cordon off the exits
Move
Out of my way
Move move move
Move move move
Out of my way
Shit
Detective Fonnegra did you identify yourself as a police officer to Mr Randol
to Roland Randol yes
when we arrived on the scene
what about Julian or the other boys who showed up that day did you identify yourself to them
i do not recall
you can not recall something as simple as standard procedure
have you ever had a gun pointed at you
how about three or four
Makes it harder to remember the minutiae
were you wearing a badge a uniform anything to distinguish yourself as a police officer
no
then it is only reasonable to assume my client was merely acting in defense of himself and his family that morning against what he perceived to be an armed intruder
oh this is horseshit
Quiet
i will remind you detective that the kind of language you may be comfortable with at the precinct will get you a contempt charge in my court
chanting
Free Julian Randol
Free Julian Randol
chanting
Free Julian Randol
Clear the court
Take the defendant out now
chanting
Free Julian Randol
Free Julian Randol
you were going to kill my little girl in that building
chanting
Free Julian Randol
Free Julian Randol
no
no
the prosecution's case is solid and a guilty verdict is both desired and in my opinion the only just way
End quote
how is that
Anytime
yeah i hope you are right
but you can still call me Jim
Thanks
Mr Martin
what do you want
the mayor in my back pocket would be a good start
yeah well i can not do that
i hear you did that you were bought and paid for
it is not true i have uh
i have been a consultant
Call it what you will but remember this whatever i may lack in Sonya's financial leverage
i more than make up for in organization
then you will be one of my first targets when i get into office
Sure
Hide your treachery behind a tough on crime agenda
Works for a lot of people
but here is what works for me
and you are going to want to get this one right
Keep Sonya's money play her game
but every move you make you gotta run by me first
chuckles
it is tough being popular
but you are gonna do this
because we are everywhere Mr Mayor
we can always get to you
you better win
i am counting on you
that was interesting
yeah what is not these days
we have a new problem
Sonya was here
in the court house
she slipped away but i know she would not show her face here unless it was extremely important
Obviously she has her sights set on this trial
i know
at first i thought it was the protesters but that little outburst was just a spectacle
not enough for her to stick her neck out
then what
there was a juror extremely anxious almost catatonic
you think Sonya got to the juror
could be
Julian has a lot of value for Liber8 they will do anything to try to set him free
Turn around
Show your face
oh come on
Shit
Shit
Come on
Smile
Agent Gardner for Kiera Cameron
phone ringing
this is Cameron
uh no
Tell him i am unavailable
Thanks
who was that
Lost dog
no more lies remember
Right
Gardner
i am actually using him to help with something
Wow that is a neat trick
what is the angle
Dead time travelers mysterious body snatchers you know the usual
Sorry i asked
what about our juror
what did we find out
Carson Hirsch
Married with a daughter
the daughter works in real estate member of the Rotary Club
that doesn't exactly scream Liber8 sympathizer
i agree
is this where you call Section Six
Hey Alec
with you checking Hirsch and his family
Ok check this out
there is been no electrical internet or telephone use in the Hirsch house in the last
no internet electric or telephone activity in the house in the last 48 hours
no credit card or debit card charges no cell phone usage
this whole time Section Six has been that kid Alec
yep
Well he is good i will give him that
what do you make of his info
we have got a nervous juror we got no online presence no activity at the house think they snatched his family
if Carson's family has been kidnapped it can mean only one thing
Sonya is setting up Julian's trial to fail
Ok
no no i got it
Thanks Shelley
so i just got off the phone with my contact at the Ministry of Justice
she said that each of the jurors was given a break before they were sequestered
our guy Carson used it to check his email
then we have to find out what was in his inbox
Hey Alec
Way ahead of you
one extremely illegal hack in T minus now
oh this explains so much
if this is the only outside contact Carson had prior to being sequestered it has to be how they sent the threat
what is that right there
not much for subtlety
Jesus
can you trace the source of the email
Alec
on it
it came from a public hotspot in New West
i can not track any further than that
Phone vibrating
Hey uh Kiera i am sorry but my mom's due in court in a few minutes i said I'd be there for her
it is ok i know you have to go
Thanks Alec
any luck
Look at this
Looks like fiberglass walls right
those are refrigeration pipes and we are looking down
that curvature this is the hull of a fishing boat
Ok what kind and where
that is a good question
Hey Betty
can you do me a favour
i need a list of all of the marinas the dry docks and marine retailers in the lower mainland
you got it
Thanks
that should get us started
i should probably brief the boss lady
how many boats do you think are moored in Vancouver
Thousands
Great
we have to inform the court that the jury has been compromised
i would not do that
Why not
if the court dismisses the jury for tampering
Carson Hirsch is of no use to Liber8
his wife and daughter
as good as dead
yeah we need to keep up the illusion that all is well until we find out where they are keeping the family
Alright do it
Find them before it is over or i will have no choice but to report to the judge
this trial is too important to go off the rails
and what did Detective Fonnegra do next Mrs Randol
Detective Fonnegra became very agitated
he said that Roland was hiding things from him
Julian heard the shouting and came running
and then when he tried to intervene that is when the detective drew his weapon
Julian was only defending himself he did nothing wrong
Alec
Alec wait
Look let me explain
Explain what
Why you lied in a court of law
that is perjury you can go to jail
you do not understand
do you know what you have done
i am supposed to testify tomorrow
and i am not asking you to lie Alec
Well if i tell the truth then i send my mother to jail
if i lie then i risk sending us both
Look Julian needs our protection he has no one else
Julian shot a police officer in cold blood
he tried to blow up a building
he was ready to do it
he doesn't deserve our protection
he is family Alec
Families do not turn their backs on one another
no apparently they throw one another to the wolves then fight over the scraps
Alec
Alec
is this going to work
Only one way to find out
so what is this thing that you are going to use
it is hard to explain
Even i do not understand it
you are the one being hooked up to it do not you think you should
after doing some initial tests on that slice you gave me
i realized it has potential to process information faster than any supercomputer on the planet
Alright
Problem is i haven't fully tested it yet
i am hoping your CMR is advanced enough to shoulder the load so to speak
so how is this going to help us find the family
the boat
there are too many images of boats schematics and blueprints for my CMR to process
but hooked up to my program and the slice we should be able to motor through millions of images and thousands of image caches across the web really quickly
i plugged in the dimensions of the ransom video and all we have to do is find a match
is it safe
you do not know
Great
Let's do it
Alright
Alec about your mother
i do not want to talk about it
i am sorry
it was not you
she is just trying to protect Julian i guess
i do not condone what she did but i do
she lied
she wants that kid out on the street at the expense of public safety
Carlos
Alright i am ready
you
Ok
you should have full control on your end right now
Gasping
what is happening
what is going on
i am fine
it feels amazing
Actually
Woah
how long is this going to take
i do not know but at the rate we are going i would not get too comfortable
that is an understatement
i mean the way you are processing this data
i would say you are going to find what you are looking for in
got it
Gilnetter 71
Well that is a start
Nice work
Rebecca
that protest in the court room was the best your people could do
we got their attention
for a minute
you are going to have to step up your game if this is important to you
i believe in Theseus
in this movement
and i am not the only one
there are underground cells everywhere that believe in his message
People need to wake up
some prefer sleeping
i do not
the movement requires everything of us
Even sacrifice
Good morning
Good morning
what time is it
you do not have to be in court for another couple of hours
have you thought about what you are going to say
it is going to be ok
it is not though
if i tell the truth then i risk sending my mother to prison for perjury
if i support her
Shh
you do not have to think about it right now
i am sorry i brought it up
Whatever you decide there is no shame in it
you will do what you feel is right
i will be there to support you
Emily you know i
i gotta go
i am so sorry i did this
it is ok honestly
no i gotta get going to work
i got lots to do
i am sorry
you do not have to
Way to go genius
Idiot
Alec
Alec
Alec
Ricky
if you are making eggs i am in
Scrambled
where is Alec Sadler
who are you
Just answer the question
Please i he is not here i swear
i do not know where he is i am telling you the truth
we will see
who are you
Screaming in pain
who are you
Tell me
have it your way
it is me
i need a clean up on location one
Stat
Tell Escher i have got something he may want to see
from light speed to a crawl
Your future tech wizardry is spoiling me Cameron
Funny i just started getting used to the uh archaic gumshoeing of yours
Funny
Alec you got anything
nothing
from the look of that boat it is been in service since the Jurassic era
half these record systems are just scanned unsearchable paper copies with zero filing system
Finding a record online is going to be a miracle
got anything on our missing family
Well we believe they are being held on a fishing boat that we can only assume is somewhere in the lower mainland
Unfortunately most of these marinas and boat graveyards do not have an online presence
it is mostly scanned paperwork with no organizational system
we can not call them for fear of tipping off the bad guys so we are just stuck chasing paper
how did you uncover the boat
Well we uh
Carlos had a hunch so i called a contact of mine at the Coast Guard
we got lucky
Gotta be good to be lucky
you gotta be a pro at that by now
i have had a lot of practice
it can not have been easy lying all the time to protect yourself protect others
it was not
Wait a minute
i have got one
Carlos look at this
Orca Gilnetter 71
Gotta be good to be lucky
is that the one
it could be i have got two heat signatures below deck two more near the bow we should flank through there
Well if there is two of them on top they are going to see us before we get there
Leave that to me
so do all cops look like you in 2077
this is CPS standard issue
Sadtech mark four polymeric nano composite body armour with integrated electromagnetic offensive and defensive systems
Police model
Fancy
what kind of mileage does it get
uh 65 years apparently
you are not even born yet
yeah we will talk about this later
so let me get this straight
Theoretically you are not born yet so you could meet baby you
Try not to get hung up on the details
so when baby you is born that means that old you could actually
Old
Well
i do not believe this is possible
do not make me regret telling you this
Drop the gun
Looks like you missed one
who the hell are you
what the hell
Kiera
Hey
that is a neat trick
i could get used to that
Looks like we are in the right place
Morning
who are you
Police
Woah hey take it easy
Nobody needs to get hurt
Fighting
New moves
Nice
you too
from the evidence
do not worry you are safe now
we will get you out of there
Mr Sadler what is your relationship to the defendant
he is my brother
would you tell the court what transpired leading up to Detective Fonnegra being shot
Detective Fonnegra and Agent Cameron came to the farm to check on a fertilizer shipment
Roland went to show them what was there instead of fertilizer there was a van equipped with a bomb
and that is when Hoyt and the others showed up and they were pointing guns at everyone
what happened next
Mr Sadler
Mr Sadler
he shot Detective Fonnegra
he knew he was a cop and Julian shot him
Court is in recess
Mr Sadler you may step down
my chambers immediately
Well detectives i am not happy about being kept in the dark over matters taking place within my court
however i understand your position
i am sure we can all agree that the safety of the family was paramount and we thank you both for their rescue
and for preventing a gross miscarriage of justice
we appreciate your understanding
what now
i wish there was another way but i will have to oversee the remainder as a bench trial
i had to tell the truth
of course
i am glad you did
it was wrong of me to expect you to lie
Why did you
i have lost Roland i am losing you i can not lose Julian
i am sorry mom
Maybe if i did not lock myself away in the barn
oh no do not apologize
you are just like your dad
so curious
Too damn smart for your own good
you are gonna do great things
i just know it
you have the ability to change the world
Resuming in five minutes
i love you Alec
Mr Randol please stand
Inmate 74216 Julian Randol
the butcher of New Pemberton aka Theseus
Shooting a police officer is a serious charge regardless of intent
the corporate congress judiciary find you guilty of the following charges high treason mass murder civil insurrection
Your actions have resulted in the deaths of millions of innocent people
the facts are irrefutable in this case
you pulled the trigger
you shot Detective Fonnegra
the mandatory sentence for these extreme violent criminal acts is execution
despite this the charge of attempted murder in the second degree is unmerited
in this case the VPD failed to follow proper procedure in identifying themselves to the accused
however this court does not have the final authority in this matter
this court finds Julian Randol to have been acting in self defense
Your sentence is to be stayed
i find Mr Randol not guilty
you will be returned to serve the remainder of your sentence the remainder of his sentence on charges for which you are currently in prison where after you will be released
that is all
you are to be transferred to corporate detention as ordered by the chairman of superior council
no
no that is not the plan
not him
the people of this city should be outraged
i assure you if you elect me mayor
i will launch a full investigation into the clear and obvious corruption of our court system
a dangerous individual like Julian Randol is free to roam the streets
it is time for a drastic change
Thank you
Carlos
what the hell was that Jim
i intend to find out
Somebody got to that judge
Well if that is true there will be a trail
we just have to find it
it was probably Liber8
with the help of somebody on the inside
if we can find him or her offer some amnesty who knows
they could help bring in Liber8 if they felt protected enough
i am going to tear this whole thing down
Well i will help you any way i can but i am not in office yet
i have to go
Problems
no
Groundwork's been set
Julian won't have anywhere to hide
i expect he will be crawling into your arms in the next couple of weeks when he is released
Your judge performed brilliantly
we all did
it is too late for regrets
who said anything about regret
the Ministry of Justice is launching a full investigation
not that it matters
in two weeks Julian Randol's a free man
Sonya planned for me to see her at the court house
she wanted us to discover the jury tampering so she could maneuver the judge into rendering a bench verdict
it doesn't make any difference ok
all she is doing is stalling justice
with Julian out on probation it is only a matter of time until he messes up again
you better believe we are going to be there when he does
are we getting drunk
i would love to
i just
i gotta wait for something
do you want us to wait for you
we will see you when we see you
 Chord Steps  by Messy Shelters
it is about time Cameron
Nice picture you sent who is he
one of your Section Six body snatchers
i put him into our database of over 170 countries
he is a ghost
Alright maybe we can
i tracked that ghost to a car rental agency
there is only five packing agencies in the lower mainland that use that particular model of compact refrigeration vehicle
and you have narrowed it down
i have even got an address
so
you wanna do this
you and me working together
Mmm hmm
what have we got to lose 
can i have a word
Sheriff please remove this young lady
i only wanted to thank you for your service
i do not know what are you talking about
Your sacrifice for the cause
the movement
Get her out of here 
Sync and corrected by dr jackson Resync for WEB DL by lost0ne for www addic7ed comGo ahead i do not have to go home so early
Wash up and take some rest
you are crazy about fried chicken
i am going to eat it now
Let's go
i am home
Hey Kyung hee i have got fried chicken for you
Hey sis come here
Hurry
are you still seeing that boxer
you know Dad met with your president today
Women is a stepping stone of my life
my father said he can not allow our dating sorry
and now may the Grace of Jesus Christ our Lord and
the love of the Father and the mercy of the Holy Spirit
be with every one of us
from this moment and on forever and ever
ln Your name Amen
where were you last night
no
nothing
there is nothing
then let's begin again
i am sorry
do not start the match
Get out of my way
i do not need you
and you do not need me as well
Go stand in front of the mirror
Take off your clothes
should i take off my underwear
Look at the mirror
i do not want to hear your excuses when you are all grown up
a boxer sees himself in the mirror more often than Miss Korea does
the posture is important but most of all
the fighter is inside you
do you understand what i mean
the player's mind is very important
you should never express your pain even when your bone is broken and it hurts as hell
Your enemy gains strength when he sees you weak
Why have we started boxing
it is because all we have is our bodies
you will be fighting the one on the mirror
Only one of you may win
Winning doesn't always mean victory
Doing your best that is what i call victory
Understood
Sing a song
from now on
the one you see before you
ls whom you will fight a fine play
Sing me a song
what is boxing
ls it beating or getting beaten up
Beating is like dreaming and getting beaten up is a hell
Victory makes you smile and lose makes you mourn
i love it i love it
Boxer's heart is
beaten up but no one knows about the pain
Today's battle was truly vicious and it finally ended with victory on decision
Duk koo Kim is the winner
we have a new champion Kim Duk koo won finally
Kim Duk koo with his two arms in the air
he is the new champion
yes indeed as expected
one is from'Mi rim Electronics' to cheer you up
you should visit them sometime tomorrow
Go and have some drink Enjoy yourself today
are not you joining us
i have to call a few people
Leave
i will buy you all a drink so call me when you and your colleagues are left
yes sir
what is taking you so long
Leave i will catch you up
Hurry up
Hustle
Welcome Ceremony about Asian Champion Duk koo Kim the champion to speak
my family was neither noble nor rich
ln fact we were the poorest family in town
but i was not poor
because i had the wide sea and the red sun in my hometown
a man should have a mind as wide as the sea
and
i am off to school
Behave yourself
i will someday become a world champion and i will wait patiently and diligently
do you want to take a picture of yourself
you go ahead
i do not feel well
you must be deadly injured
i have something to tell your mom
Ladies and gentlemen Let's congratulate them with a big heart
and following will be the benediction from the reverend
Let's pray
and now may the Grace of Jesus Christ our Lord and
the love of the Father and the mercy of the Holy Spirit
be with every one of us gathered here to celebrate the engagement ceremony
from this moment and on forever and ever
ln Your name we pray Amen
i think boxing made me a man with a good heart
lf i did not learn how to box for real
i may have turned into a villan who picks on a fight with everyone
so i thought to myself that i must win the battle of my own
so i can put up with any hardships in the future
this will be the source of strengh throughout my life
we expect to see more victory and fighting spirit from Kim Duk koo in the future
this was the match between the WBC Light weight
Asian Champion Kim Duk koo
what are you doing
you do not box with your hands
you do with your head
Why
you embarrassed
Byung pal you sure about this
my world championship title
should i go with you
no it is okay i think i will visit my hometown
so this decision was
Enough enough
ln other words
OK OK
you mean Jong pal fighting with haggler will gain no popularity
so you will cancel our contract and pay us a penalty
that is correct
Mr Bob Arum is also having much trouble
he apologized a lot of Times and he said he would pay you today
it is okay
we will not accept the penalty
we will not accept the penalty
it is more than 100 000 dollars
Just tell him what i say
i raise boxers and promote them
i do not want the money when they are not even going to have matches
lnstead if you have a player who is worthy of the world title
lf there is such a champion to be among us
i want him to have a match with one of my players
how shall we make the contract
no
no problem
than how can you believe me
i know you were also a boxer once
a boxer never lies
O K Thank you
Doesn't it hurt when you get beaten up
you sometimes get beaten up do not you
when you focus on the match it feels as if you did not get one hit
though you look terrible after the match
you looked very handsome on our engagement day when you were wearing suits
Why can not you always wear it
when i become a world champion and make a great deal of money then i will wear a suit everyday
this is the only chanceyou've got Think carefully
i gotta go yes
what
Sang bong you did fine also
Stop by next time
i am on my way to meet with the president of Mirim Electronics
do you want to join me
i am about to meet with the chairman
Hey Duk koo the dog
Let's spar
Why
you embarrassed
you are still a kid
what the hell are you doing
who told you to spar without my words
a tadpole needs water to survive
lf you forget about your past when you were only a tadpole and forget about the water feeder then you are only a frog not a man
i am quitting from today
Why
you embarrassed
i got something else
Hey Sang bong
the coach was not there for me at the corner
it was more disappointing than when i went to see my father
ls he strong
who
Mancini
his father used to be a famous boxer but he failed to become a champion because of the war
he used to be good and that is why his son became a champion instead
then he must be strong
i shall kill him or i will get killed
how could you say that
do not cry
i am not going to die am l
i will certainly win
do not come to the air port
we will announce our marriage when i become a world champion wait for me
can i ask you something
huh
lf someone told your son to box like Menthony would you do it
lf he insists
how about you
me
i do not know man
this is a Life and Death Match
who is it
Byung gu you asleep
yes
how do you feel
this is a Life and Death Match
you should remember such a thing in your heart
Understood
Go to sleep early
Good night sir
15th match
6th round
the winner is still unknown
ln Korean they call Player Kim'Little Mancini'
lf Kim wins over this match
Mancini should be called'Little Kim'
ln other words it is more than just hard to guess the winner of this match
it must be hard and tough for both of the players
Player Kim's father has brought ginseng tea from Korea
there is something common between these two players
their will to win
the degree of ambition and strength is about the same
i doubt if ginseng could be helpful
there is a red hot cabbage called'Kim chi' in Korea
Left right
Mancini is dashing vigorously
will you be okay
Duk koo Duk koo
Duk koo Duk koo can you hear me Duk koo
lf you have anything to say tell me at home
there are too many people here
no i have to tell you now
i am not dead yet
i am alive
Why is everyone telling me i am dead
Mom i slept last night
i think Duk koo will return today
i had a good dream
i will drop by
Let's go home
i want to go in
it is okay Go on
i have courage and will for last fighting
Duk koo Kim's DiaryLong distance relationship are hard

Annabeth Mayor Hayes is totally into it
it doesn't matter
there is no world in which
i could pursue a relationship

this is worth fighting for
i know you got your girl code but i will wait

yeah oh no
if you want to buy the Rammer Jammer go ahead
but it is an opportunity
i am willing to give up for the sake of our friendship
Well it doesn't matter anyway
i do not know where I'd get the money so
Mm Brick would give you the money

you were right Annabeth it is time for me to do something on my own
with your help of course
of course

Ah just supporting the advancements
Title 9 has given us Tucker

Jonah i just want to say that Zoe Hart is a good person okay
and she has been through a lot lately so the last thing she needs right now is a sleaze ball trying to take advantage of her
Wow
does she have a mental impairment of some kind
no she does not
then i guess she is capable of making sound decisions
so if she wants to play doctor with an actual doctor that would be none of your business 
Crowd in unison

i
i am so sorry
but we will be back as soon as possible all right
all right
Ah classic classic George Tucker
what are you talking about
he is sabotaging our date on purpose
you know he already warned me to stay away from you
i i guess that was not blatant enough
no he did not
Why would he do that
Well maybe he doesn't want me doing it with the
the girl he left his fiance at the altar for
Well you are so so far off base
and who ever said that you and i were gonna have sex
Well it was kind of implied
George would not sabotage our date
George is good
George is you are not
the town of Bluebell
Mobile Bay's hot new Spring Break destination is really turning up the heat this week with its new hard body contest
Palms on a Pleasure Craft
Well
How'd it go
Well i brought your idea to the Belle Investors' Fund and they were very enthusiastic
they all contributed something
oh
that is amazing
how much did we raise
Six hundred and forty eight dollars
Annabeth raising your voice high like that doesn't make it sound like more
i thought it might
no
Well
and there is more bad news
Ruby Jeffries is in town
what
Why
for some reason she is sponsoring a hands on a boat contest
Scoffs it is crazy
that thing is worth like 50 000
Say what
okay now when i give the whistle you must put one hand on the boat and keep at least one hand on the boat the winner being the last person with one hand on the boat
so if there are no other contestants
oh
one more
Clears throat
Well Lemon Breeland
this is one contest you might actually win
i am not in it
oh i will win it
and i thank you in advance for giving me the money to buy the Rammer Jammer
oh you have got to be kidding me
Hmm
are you sure that i need this
yes because when you win you will be on TV
Ow
Annabeth
you just mascara'd my eyeball
Lemon sighs
Poor Lavon
we should pray for his soul
he is clearly weak willed as far as the Jeffries Devil is concerned
but we cannot let ourselves get distracted by her
we have a contest to win
you are right
Absolutely right
Mm hmm
so who you doing it for
oh um me i guess
i guess i am doing it for my dad even though he is not here to see it
Hell he probably would not even want me having a boat
since he died at sea
oh
Well it is whatever
you know i just figured if i win it and i mean what are the chances of that
I'd put his name right up there on the stern and I'd sail to all the places he never got to go
because he died trying to save the dolphins
Wade Kinsella what are you talking about
Your daddy is alive and drunk right here in this town are you trying to trick this poor girl into letting you win the contest
no
no of course not
i am trying to trick her into sleeping with me
Whoa
hello
Zinger
Laughs yeah
Judges
Grunts
you think you got what it takes
Come on
Did you see that
Wade might actually have half a brain in his head
we need to start culling the herd too
Zoe
now you are gonna keep that on for the next two weeks
oh thank God
that was the third idiot to jump from the Whippoorwill Blossom balcony into the pool
Well the Whippoorwill Blossom
Doesn't even have a pool
yeah i realize that
but you are back now so you can handle it from here
Well ah not exactly
oh no
yeah yes i hurt the darn thing trying to loosen a lug nut and
Why did you even go fishing today
you knew how busy we'd be
Well i thought we'd be back in a couple hours
you want to blame someone it was George who insisted we take the scenic route home
that is how i got lost and popped a tire to begin with
it was George's idea
yeah h he said something about migrating ducks and how we could not afford to miss them
Stay here
Take this acetone into the exam room
i will be right back i have a lawyer to kill
Lemon
it is an affliction is what it is
sometimes i just get so competitive that something clicks inside of me and i am just not myself anymore
i mean that poor girl just wanted to win prom queen
she does walk straight upright again and she was even in People magazine as one of those people who pressed on even after a horrible accident
Well well well
Look like we are the only ones left
and you are sorely outmatched
Why do you even want the Rammer Jammer Lemon
Buying that bar is my dream
Well too bad it is my dream too
Hey you two
i just wanted to say thanks for trimming the fat around here
Where'd you come from
oh
i like to lie in wait
Kind of like a panther
Throaty hiss Gasps yeah i do about 20 events on the hard body circuit every year
yeah you think you are tired now wait another 36 hours
Your ankles swell you sweat hot and cold
but it is when the hallucinations kick in that you need to start to worry
' Cause at that point you are just one thin step away from brain damage
uh hallucinations
when you start to hallucinate bail
otherwise your friends will be playing
Hands on a Casket
Yours
yeah i got that
Great
so who wants to sing a song  oh  99 bottles  of beer on the wall 99 bottles of beer  Wade joins in  you take one down you pass it around   98 bottles of beer on the wall 
George
Hey Zoe
Did you sabotage my date with Jonah
what
no
Did you tell Brick to take the scenic route back from fishing
and did you tell Jonah not to take me to Spring Break
yeah George did you
Hey Tansy
um
Well uh
yeah
i did
Why would you do that
are you jealous
that better not be it' cause we have been over that
yes we have been over that
Ba baby we have been over that
i know
i was here
okay so uh no not jealous
now could it seem that these two events are related
Zoe Tansy
yes
yes
but they are not
okay
it was Brick's fault
he was driving the car
how could i predict that he would hit a tree trunk and then get a flat tire and then hurt his hand trying to fix it
i am not Nostradamus
Chuckles Clears throat
but yes as far as Jonah goes
i do not like the guy
okay Zoe
he is a player
and he takes advantage of women so as a friend
Whoa
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
i was taking advantage of him
i do not know if you noticed but i haven't been having the best time lately
and if i wanted to cheer myself up with a little Spring Break fun
i am perfectly entitled to
with or without your judgment
so now if you will excuse me
i am going to call my date who hopefully will still talk to me after i defended you and called him a jerk
hello
oh hey
Hey Brick i just uh figured I'd bring your stuff back
what what you got there
oh more of Shelby's stuff
uh girl loves her hair products
Hmm
Well it looks uh looks a little heavy
did not think you'd be able to lift that after you smashed your hand up yesterday
oh
oh uh yeah right
Well you know uh
Well the swelling went down
i took the splint off and by golly good as new
oh
and thank you for uh bringing
all that stuff
yeah
of course of course
uh i should get
i should get going
um yeah
Hey you know what Brick
uh i am sorry
if you are feeling better maybe uh maybe you could give Zoe a call and cover the office for her so she could go to Spring Break
yeah sure uh right
i will give her a call right away
okay
all right
yeah
Thanks
uh i will see you around Brick
yeah
Woman

Zoe
Listen i am sorry about last night
you were right
it turns out George is not exactly your biggest fan
yes he told me that himself
so when Brick called me and said that his hand was better and he could work
i figured it was my chance to make it up to you
so i looked up a list of the top ten Spring Break activities but since most of them involved showing boobs
i looked up the second top ten
i figured that we could do keg stands jell o shots and watch the best Booty contest before lunch
Wow someone's taking Spring Break
by the horns
oh yeah
that is right
i am tight
we should get a drink
but not at a bar
i want my drink funneled or luged
Luged right
you can get a drink luged
Look Zoe
the whole point of Spring Break is just to is just to be a little spontaneous
do the things that you have never let yourself do before
how about we just see where the moment takes us
Laughs Chuckles
oh
Hey Lemon why do not you get your daddy just go out and buy you a boat
Go on get out of here
Give up
Bad news Kinsella you need a license to drive a boat

Alliance over
Damn right
hi
hi
George more of your past has come to visit
Well hello Shelby
you look nice
here to hit me again
no
i am just being neighborly
now that i have moved in with Brick and all
i brought you a chiffon cake
now that is nice but you will have your hands full baking cakes for every neighbor in Bluebell
okay fine
i have an agenda
George
Mmm
to hit me
no
it is about Brick
i am worried
that he is too old for you
no
Sorry
he just is not acting himself
he is a little off clumsy and getting a lot of headaches
Come to think of it he did have a headache yesterday when we were coming home
before he drove the car into the tree
yeah
okay
now i have what some people would call
alarmist tendencies
Like this one time
i was convinced my mom was struck by the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues when really she was just practicing her Chinese language tapes
so i am sure that that Brick is fine and i am just overreacting
Right
yeah
Zoe
Spring Break
okay just be careful
this will get you drunk super quickly
Well as a doctor you should know that alcohol metabolizes at a fixed rate so
oh Zoe
there you are
Seriously
Look i am sorry to interrupt
uh but i need to talk to you
Jonah
of course you do
Just as she happened to be having fun with me
okay this is not about you Jonah
Zoe i am sor sorry
you are upside down
Jonah
yeah
oh my God
Look it is about Brick
uh Shelby said that he is been really clumsy lately
and that he is been getting a ton of headaches
and then there is this miraculously healed hand injury
Wait Brick would not fake a hand injury no way
that is not like him
no it is not
Later Tucker
okay look Shelby is worried
okay
and the more i think about it when were driving home that tree branch was in the middle of the road the whole time but Brick swears that it came out of nowhere
i really think something might be going on with him
so tripping
i mean that is balance
Virus
Maybe stress related
he is a doctor if it was a virus he would've rested up
Unless he is covering up symptoms because he already knows it is something more serious
we need to go see Brick
now
George thank you
you did the right thing
Bad balance blurred vision and headaches
Your symptoms are serious Brick
you are exaggerating
could be a migraine or nothing
or a thyroid problem
or a brain tumor
Sighs we got to get you checked out Brick
you can not ignore this
and frankly i do not know why you'd want to
we have to call your family and Shelby
no
we are not calling Shelby
Look
Shelby and i Sighs we just got together
she just moved in
i i do not want her thinking she is saddled with some dying old man
Brick you are not dying
and you are
i will call Mobile Presbyterian
i will set up an MRI for the morning
but no one is calling Shelby or anyone else
Whatever you want
Zoe
i will pick you up in the morning
Good
Gulls squawking
oh hey

yeah they are not giving up are they
oh looks like you have got company
Annabeth i

Why do you even care so much Lemon
Go bake some cupcakes okay
Decorate a house

Sighs Hey
Doc

oh no
she is come as a doctor to put us out of our misery
you should go first

Really
Whistling ducks

Show tunes mostly

both laughing
i am glad that i missed that

and it was just because i i could not Sighs
could not stand Jonah being with you
because
because he doesn't appreciate you Zoe
he is not capable of it
he is uh he is not gonna see all that you how special you are

we wanted to talk to you actually
we have written a book too
Erm it is called
Duncan is a prick

a picture of a prick
I'd never do this to you

Really

Look Ben i do not know what i have done to you but why do not we sit down when you are a bit more sober and have a coffee
i am
you are sober

Get your sister along
Ooh

i am sorry if your night was spoilt
it was spoilt yeah

i do not remember what happened
you are gonna apologise
i have apologised

since this book came out you are pretending to be this other person
Going to the Opera hanging out with people like him
you should remember who your real friends are
i can not believe you are trying to making this about me
yeah that is usually your job is not it
that is nice Ben
i will see you later
Fine go
i give up on you Hannah
Completely
you know what
i give up on you
i have had enough
i just give up
i have spent all this time writing about clients but i wonder what it is like to BE a client
i wish i could be reckless and act like a prick every now and again
but running a company i can not
Just research
Duncan'll be fine about it
Won't he

Please do not do that

John
Check the lighting hurry up
Micheal
Play the music
we are rolling
Ready
Go South
there is trouble again
what is it
i did not ask
because they never answer
this is the fifth time since i was small
i used to be scared
but not anymore
Papa taught me not to worry if it can not be solved
i know i can not help so i won't think about it
i went to study in the States when i was eight
a classmate told me
Papa is a triad boss
i asked Papa once
he nodded but did not answer
i never asked again
i also know i am Papa's foster child
my Papa
i checked Gent
it is all rubber bullets
they just want to scare you not kill you
do not worry
it is nothing
so we do not need to do anything
you are sure
if we do not make a move our reputation will rot
our reputation will rot
who do you want to kill
could be an accident
i have no clue who is behind this
Pilot
Did i make enemies recently
you are asking a bodyguard
Why not ask your guardian angel
should not you know better
Whacko what is the point of this
Why take it out on us
that is the way Whacko talks
Take it easy Buddy
Stay calm
Gent we must use this chance to boost our reputation
you are retiring
you do not need to worry
but what about us
then let's enjoy a comfortable life
shall we
Cheers Cheers
to all my Uncles Let's eat
i can not hear a word you are saying girl
Your Cantonese is even worse than a few years ago
there is no one i can speak Cantonese to in the States
and Papa won't let me come back
Find a Cantonese boyfriend when you go back
Problem solved
you can understand her Buddy
yeah
You' II find a boyfriend
the glow on your face indicates this autumn
do not listen to that garbage
Eat some fish
and learn to take out the fish bones
Thanks Papa
this tastes like water
I' II grab something stronger
i miss you all so much
we miss you very much too
so you got a boyfriend
is he black
no
now tell us do you have a boyfriend
no
we won't tell your Papa
why are saying it is a black guy
you can not hide it
i said no

Thank you
Am i really gonna find a boyfriend

Too spicy
the food is not spicy
she is choking from fish bones
Choking

Vinegar is here
Make her drink it

Knock her hard
Knock real hard
what happened
i am fine now
what are you guys up to

it is not them it is me
i choked myself
Fish bones again

you are fine now
Silly little girl Let's eat
You' II really defend them won't you
do not know why i still remember
that boy on the beach
i do not know him but i know he is kind
he saved a little kid
while i saved his grandma
little Red Hood
little Red Hood
little Red Cap
you can find it no matter where i hide it
then do not hide it
Just trying to give you some advice
Papa i am old enough to have some privacy
it should be little Red Cap
who is he
Papa please
Using a wrong word is no big deal
but sometimes there is no turning back after making a mistake
You' II have to seek your own path one day
Why not let your Papa guide you for a while first
yes
Let me do it
it is your favorite midnight snack
there i ate it
do not tire yourself Papa
Why not let me stay with you here
no
then come with me
no
you said before
You' II come when i enter university
i always honor my word
then let's go
Let me finish some business first
because this time when i leave
i won't be coming back
i am retiring
Why come after me now
of course they are coming after you now
you are no longer protected by your triad's name
you are just an ordinary person
Join us
this is the safest haven
if I'd be a monk I'd be here before you were
I'd been fighting with you for over ten years
Finally got tired and gave you everything
and went to live in a worn down temple
i tore that one down and built you this beautiful one
you did two good things in your life
you built this temple
and saved that girl
but it is futile
Retribution will find its way
Going to hell
i am ready for it
there is something i need to discuss with you
who do you think want me dead
with your years of experience
and you still can not figure it out
then you deserve to die
it is not that i do not know
i do not want to guess
because i do not want to be right
i do not want to know it is that person
Mr Gent Shade knew i took the money
Shade wanted to kill me first
you killed Shade
i know his wife will kill me
she went wild and vowed to kill my whole family
Please save my daughter
Nova you had your revenge
Enough is enough
i must kill his whole family
that is wiping out a family's bloodline
i do not care
the little girl is innocent
you have no right to protect her
i am going to marry her when she is eighteen
Go ahead kill my wife
Get lost Nova
Nova is not here yet
i am not gonna wait anymore
Nova why
Why do we have to listen to Gent
we are gonna take over his lead soon
Why bother
i will meet Gent
no need to be afraid of him
Ok
i guess you all know why i gathered you here today
everyone who has the guts to kill me is here
the reason i choose this place is to give you a chance
to clear your head and think
Keep drinking
i am at a meeting
will come later
there are girls there
Ok as soon as i finish here
i know i won't get an answer today
i just want you all to remember
Even your combined power cannot defeat me
i am returning because none of you can take over
if i stay in the business
those who do not like it will be excluded
Once excluded they will disappear
Your families are out there
Treasure them
if i am alive
we can have dinner together every month
Pray that i am safe
if i am in danger
so will your families
Call me arrogant
of course i am arrogant
who is more powerful than i am
Nova everyone's waiting for you
i am already paying more respect than you deserve
i guess we do not have anything to talk about
you said you will marry the girl when she is eighteen
Time's up
have you married her yet
hi
you remember me
you helped my grandma on the beach
what are you doing here
my grandma
why are you all afraid of someone who is so scared of death
all of you are men with no guts
if you do not marry her i will go out and kill her
do not you dare put a finger on her
i will make sure your grandma has incense
it is an honorable retirement
Pilot went to buy a new diary for her
one with a lock
everything fine
Did you know what happened just now Buddy
where is the fire inside you
i know what i am doing
do not worry
where is the girl
Papa is gone
Papa
Papa
Papa
Papa
Find out if Chance is the one who killed Gent
do not let anyone know i am checking
Nova Whacko is wiping out everyone
no matter if they are friends or enemies
he is gone berserk
the four of them used to be really close
None of my business
he is messing with our territory
if Whacko keeps this up finish him off
Whatever i say you' II keep going down this path
Await your retribution
who is in charge from now on
Whacko got us most of our territories
he should
it is okay with me
Chance do you want to
Gent told me before he died
he wanted the girl to take over
no way
Gent would not let the girl know anything
you sure
Gent said he would marry her
she is still drinking milk
you want us to listen to her
if that is what Gent wanted do you all accept
Say something
any brother of mine i trust
but trust doesn't mean respect
then it is decided
you kidding me
None of us here is qualified for the seat
you are the only one objecting
if you want to fight for it i will challenge you to the end
Your retribution is here
do not spread it to the innocent
i tried not to think about Papa's departure
but the people around me have all changed
i am used to being alone
but i never felt this lonely
Gent saved you as well as the girl Nova
Using the dead won't earn you respect Chance
Gent asked us to look after you when he retired
everything i got today i earned with my own hands
Gent helped you behind the scenes
Trying to talk me into recruiting you
i could not understand why did you go and have child with other man
you are so naughty
there is no unsolvable problem because there is no problem
Mercy if used unwisely will only hurt yourself
i do not understand what you are saying
i really do not understand
Why are you locking me up
Why do not you let me do what i want to do
i am so unhappy
where are you taking me Pilot
to where Mr Chance ordered
i do not know the details
Why did not you ask
i did not ask
i never ask why when they give me orders
are you lying to me
no
i do not know if i said i do not know
i do what they ask me to do
and i say what they tell me to say
they never tell me why
Why are you so dumb
i am not dumb
they saved my life
i have no money no friends no education
they employ me so i must obey them
my life is worth nothing except to protect their lives
but i was so useless that i could not protect Mr Gent
i only know i must protect you now
Even if i die i must protect you
Sorry
no problem
you are a good man
Thank you
Go up now to represent us in this meeting
Relax and it' II be fine what meeting
do not promise anything
Just tell them you need time
do not give them a decision Understand
i do not understand
she won't understand anything now
when you are up there just listen
Walk out if you hear anything you do not like
and act mean
i do not want to go
you are representing your Papa
i am not going
Stop there
not everyone is allowed to go up
who do you think you are
i am talking to you
can not you hear me
you go up
they are waiting for you
if you are here to represent Gent what is your post
Nova's asking you
Answer her
what is your position and who are you representing
do not fool around
little girl how old are you
Speak
i am the boss
what boss
Hugo Boss
you are the boss
who is not a boss here
Stop playing
she said who she is
you guys shut up
Gent left things undecided
can you decide for him
do not waste our time
i need time to think
Think
you are not capable of thinking
i am in charge from now on
in here one wrong call
and people can die from it
you bring shame to your father today
how did it go
Calm down first
can you talk now
Did they try to threaten you
i do not know what is happening
i feel betrayed by you guys
you ask him
Cut it out
so you are with him now
what are you implying
i will explain later
that is not what we agreed on
what are you trying to do
you said she will be in charge
that is enough
i saw Papa just now
you all used to love me
i am so scared of you all now
i do not want to do anything
if i were in charge i will order you to disband right now
i will order you to be good men
you all used to be good men
Let me do it
Sorry
Dinner is ready
they are all your favorite dishes
Sorry for what happened
Sorry
Almost ready
there are always two sides to a coin
Just depends on how you look at it
do not be stubborn girl
Eat
Food on the plane tastes bad
Pilot will go with you to the States
Stay there for a while
We' II come visit you
Definitely no bones this time
oh no
Again
Take care of yourself
Still unhappy
you are a good person
you really care for your Ankles
it is Uncles
Too bad i can not ask what happened
i understand how you feel
Perhaps it is because i was always there
Watching you and protecting you
with you around me
i feel very safe
i will drive faster
i am a good driver
do not worry it will be fun
Hot pot tomorrow night
how about coming out for a drink
do not tell me
Almost thirty years of friendship can come down to this
it is pointless
Let's split it
do you know
it is my first time on a plane
and going to America
i always wanted to go to America
you can show me around
i seldom talk to people
Except you
with me beside you you have nothing to worry
Just study and be happy
then I' II be happy too
what do you want Buddy
Come out Whacko
what
you are even afraid of me
Why should i be afraid of you
Stupid
what do you want
i am you closest friend
what are you trying to say
the four of us
Skip the lecture have seen the worst together
what do you want
Whenever we quarreled it never lasted
you have gone too far this time and can not turn back
you are the one who killed Gent
i did not mean to kill him
i was just trying to scare him
he did not do anything after he retired
and i had to do his work
None of the juniors can fight
they are all businessmen
everyone out there was trying to get back at me
and Gent still would not come out to settle it
you had to kill him because of this
Let me tell you he knew everything
i had no other choice
yes you did
no i did not
Gent never mentioned it to me
you just assumed he knew
i am not crazy
i am not making it up
what am i scared of
i am scared of being killed
i kill because i am scared of being killed
Dumping the corpse in our territory
Obviously to make us look responsible
it is ok i will take care of it
what have you done
it is taken care of
someone is gonna die for this
who is gonna die
Hiding her here won't solve the problem
i do not care
i do not trust anyone anymore
i only know i won't let anything happen to her
i will kill whoever comes
then why are not you standing right next to her
what about you
you know what is happening
Yet you use your religion as an excuse to stay out of it
you watch the world but you won't allow the world to see you
you are hiding just like me
you are no Buddha
if you are still a man face it and solve it
i am waiting for you at the backdoor little Red Cap
Run
Run
she
who told you that you could take care of it yourself
Uncle Whacko
Nova wants to kill you
Why
she was the one who killed your parents
you killed my family
Want revenge
this is a stupid way to do it
it is a cruel world
for every winner there is a loser
the loser always sees the winner as an enemy
i won't fight with anyone
you do not have a choice
Stab her
what are you doing
i want to stab her stab her to death
Give me your knife
mm
Young master do not cry
we go in and play shall we
do not cry
it is ok do not cry
you said you love me you said you will stand up for me
you hit me and i hate you
so you must kill me
the world is not as simple as it seems
Your Uncles are the ones behind everything
they are killing each other
Buddy is dead
Whacko meet me right now
Cut the nonsense and come out
is Uncle Buddy dead
what is happening
was it because of me
it is not your fault
if Papa wants me to be in charge i do not want anything
Take everything
Gent did not want you to be in charge
i made it up
if i do not use you someone else will take the seat
i did not believe it was him
i made the wrong decision
you used to be the best of friends
my mistake my responsibility
no please
Uncle Chance
Let go of me
no please
you believe in fate
Let fate decide for you
Save Uncle first
Sorry
in fact happiness can be very simple
You' II be happy if you want to be happy
are you happy
i wonder if anyone will remember my birthday next month
i bet my Uncles will
they love me so much
when is your birthday
when you shave off your hair
you vow with all beings
to forever divorce all afflictions
and pass on to ultimate tranquility Happy Birthday
Buddhist Ordination Ceremony
we will disband
for she has changed the worldi do not know what they would've done if they caught me
but it was all worth it
this find may hold the answer
to one of the most famous unsolved murders
in the history of new york city
Come on sutton show it to us
Let's see what you found
Vincent try to be patient
James
Why not just tell him what you found
it might shut him up
i like vincent
much more than i trust him
Single gunshot to the abdomen
no obvious sign of a struggle
Heavy concentration of gsr
this was
Up close and personal
our vic is
James sutton he is an archeologist
yeah i know
it seems historical digs
are back in fashion the latest
Underground craze
no pun intended
he came from the journeymen's club around the block
and that is laura roman
she found the body
Phoned it in about an hour ago
Looks like james sutton
Fashioned himself a real indiana jones
Till someone made this his last crusade
High velocity spatter
some sort of blue liquid
Still got his credit cards
Jewelry
his cash
could probably rule out robbery
Looks like something was wrapped in this
Hmm
i have linear abrasions on either side of his neck
Consistent with a necklace
Being pulled off
and there is no bleeding
Means it was taken postmortem
Whoever killed
this guy knew exactly
what they were after
and it was more valuable than the 500 cash
he is got in his wallet
where were you when you heard the shot
i was um
Outside the main entrance of the club
i thought it was a car backfiring
and how much time passed
Between the shot and when you found the body
a few minutes
i left the club but could not catch a cab
so i decided to start walking
Figured I'd have a better shot
of catching one a block over on lex
oh my god
James
what was your relationship with james
uh we were friends
Colleagues
some people i interviewed in the club said
that he found something on a recent expedition
that he considered very important
you have any idea what that was
or exactly where he found it
Know of anyone who may have wanted to hurt james
Did he have any enemies
he did say he was chased from his dig site by someone
every man in this club
Wanted to be james sutton
and every woman wanted to be with him
i do not see why
anyone would want to kill him
Unfortunately
Envy and jealousy top the list
when it comes to motives for murder
this should be the last of them
Looks like plastic
Definitely embedded
by the blast
and now we go in
for the grand prize
Very shallow penetration
Doesn't make any sense
we have
Stippling heavy concentration of gsr
everything seems to indicate close contact gunshot wound
i agree based on the appearance
of the entry wound i was actually expecting
a through and through
you have any idea what kind
of gun could inflict this kind of damage
Maybe the bullet can answer that
Get an id on o our killer chef
i think i stumbled
Upon something even bigger
Really yeah
something sinister
and evil
i think
we are looking at a serial killer here stella
and he is killing rats
okay how does this relate to sutton
we have traces of blood on the oven mitt
from our vic and we also have traces of blood and hair
from multiple donors that are not human
Rat rat
Right
what are you thinking
you pulled that fishhook from the oven mitt did not you
yeah boom
you think it has something to do with sutton's murder
something maybe everything
Come on let's take a ride
yeah
yeah
Ooh ah
i got you now
you big son of a
Meet wolford bessie
a k a the rat fisherman
Nice
Three blocks from the scene of sutton's murder
yeah dumpsters are full
of trash and rats the size of cats
it is wolford's favorite fishing hole
Ooh ooh go ahead get get out of here
Please tell me that is always
Catch and release
Depends on how hungry i am
if you'd been here an hour ago
you would've seen me with a two pound norway brown
i think that is some kind of record
Wow i will look for your article
in american fisherman
Animal rights people did not send you
no this is not about the rat fishing wolford
although i should lock you up
Just for wasting a good slice
Well i might finish it later
oh yeah well
before you snack we found one
of your oven mitts at the scene
of a murder last night
how did it get there buddy
Why you sweating me man
i lose stuff
Haven't you ever lost anything before
what is that
my mama told me
the only thing worth stealing
is a kiss from a sleeping child
something was wrapped in here
i knew i should
have just left it there
oh are not you a little cutie
what huh
huh oh
Look at all this
Give it up wolford
what else you got something
was taken from the vic's neck
oh
i
i did not get a good look
at either one of them you know not the guy
Standing over the body
or the one that scared me away
it was dark
you are sure the package that that watch came in
was untied and on the ground when you found that body
i i swear on my sister's eyes
Your sister's blind wolford
my other sister shantell
Wait wait wait man before you put
the bracelets on me look
i am helping the murder police with a big case
Looks like homicide gave him a get out of jail free card
can i can i
Get the card back no
you only get to play that card once wolford
here
Why do not you take mine
you remember anything else give me a call
you know the watch
i can understand it was on the ground
but ripping a medallion off a dead man's neck
i thought it would add some nice weight
to the cast you know
Well it was not like he
was gonna need it no more
i do not make wolford as our killer
no history of violence
the necklace he snatched
Looks just like a cheap souvenir
now the watch could have been worth something
but if wolford knew that he would have pawned it
so if he was telling the truth
the killer left the necklace behind
which means it was not the reason
Sutton was murdered
Flack said sutton was chased from the dig site
Maybe whoever that was caught up to him
Expecting to see someone else
we need to find that dig site
all right i will check his apartment
Find out what he was working on
i hope there was a good explanation
for this actually i
a really um actually
it is it is a really good explanation
uh let let me show you
i was working on the paper recovered at the scene
it looks like
some kind of map so i tried to identify
what part of the city it is
Problem is
Whoever created this did not want anyone
to figure out what it was so
i studied the odd fold marks
and wear patterns in the original document
it
it took me a little time
but i was able to recreate the same folds on this copy
Check it out
oh if you press the wings of the plane together
they form a new map
it is a two block area
with no street names no compass no key
it might look like manhattan
but it is gonna take some time
to get an exact location
so why is half the lab
Out in the hall watching you fly paper airplanes
uh you know that is a good point
and um
i am gonna walk way
and work and hopefully save my job
Ow
yeah flack
i got the warrant for sutton's apartment
Landlord said he would meet us with the key
Great okay i will see you there
Turn around and you die
our suspect is six foot 180 pounds
Dark hair dark eyes
Armed with a large caliber automatic pistol
last seen fleeing down onseven street and park
no i pulled my gun mac
this guy disarmed me in a matter of seconds
he was a pro
now i doubt he left any trace behind
and and he spoke
in fluent greek he came up to you
Speaking greek no english but he got
a little angry when i started to fight back
and he cursed at me in greek
something about his accent tells me
he is from northern greece
you okay
for a minute there i thought i was gonna come out
of that stairwell in a body bag
we got a description out there
and a detail's been assigned
to protect you and danny
we will get this guy he knew danny and i
Questioned the rat fisherman
Wanted to know
what we took off of him
a leather necklace with some trinket on it
and an old pocket watch
i do not get it
Maybe the watch is an antique
one of those auction deals
that collectors pay top dollar for
if it is why would sutton's killer leave it behind
Hey how is stella
she is tough
this is the round recovered
from sutton's body
it is a bullet with no lands and grooves
there is no way of knowing
Make or model of the weapon
Well more than likely
it was fired through a bored out barrel
Right but the inconsistency is
it is a close contact wound with shallow penetration
Even a weapon with a bored out barrel
at close range would have enough velocity
to penetrate deep into the body
Means that bullet had to come
from a homemade weapon
Welcome to my mystery
what else do you have
i am in the process
of reassembling the plastic shards
Sid pulled from around the wound
and the blue high velocity spatter
we found on the vic's shirt came back
as mineral oil dyed
Dozens of uses
and the bullet's untraceable
but maybe the trace it left behind is not
James sutton should not be dead
the round i pulled from his body did not kill him
an old gunshot wound
Completely healed
Impossible to date accurately
but I'd say at least a year or two old
Flack did a criminal history on sutton
there was no report of him
Being the victim of a shooting or an assault
i did notice
Lots of extra scarring along the wound tract
which suggests that someone
with little or no medical training
was digging around in there to get that bullet out
Location and severity
of the wound make it unlikely
it was sutton himself
the only people who do not report being shot
are criminals right
or someone trying to protect the person who shot them
now the bullet that entered sutton's body
last night nicked the lower intestine
there
the laceration was enough to give him a giant stomachache
but the bullet stopped there
if we go a little further
Just a second
now there is our cod
Ruptured abdominal aorta
but sid you said the bullet
did not travel deep enough to hit that artery
Correct
but the old gunshot wound resulted
in the weakening of that arterial wall
because he never sought proper medical treatment
the aneurysm went undetected
Exactly and the trauma
of the bullet entering his body
Caused the aneurysm to burst killing him almost instantly
so james sutton was killed
from a gunshot wound he suffered more than a year ago
Central this is 21 king we are 10 84
we got a dp down here at central park
Requesting a coroner's unit
Parks department worker found him
Looks like he tried to put up a fight
not a very good one
he is got a dislocated pinky
some of his fingers are broken
he was tortured
and then his neck was snapped
it is got to be the same guy who pulled me off the street
i gave the fisherman my card
so he killed wolford
then used the information on the card to get to you
Means our fisherman was dead before you were pushed
into that stairwell
yeah but why kill the fisherman and not me
Dead cop brings a lot of heat
what about a dead archaeologist
no whoever killed the fisherman
did not kill sutton think about it
Wolford heard the shot turned into the alley
and saw the killer running away
he approached the body
and as he was snatching the watch
he looked up and saw
a different man coming toward him
that man had to have seen wolford
Take the watch and the necklace
then he tracked him down and murdered him
we are looking for two different killers
Why are we looking
at a picture of franklin delano roosevelt adam
because the porcelain shard
that lindsay found in the soil sample
from the crime scene belongs to that china
oh you mean a china set like that one
no i mean that china set
it is about 70 years old
the modified floral pattern is unique
it is the roosevelt
Three thorned roses inside a crest
with three white ostrich plumes on top
it is a personalized one of a kind set
what is this
it is the soil analysis you were just about to ask me for
Main component is
Manhattan schist
it is a stone commonly found at least 25 feet underground
we found traces of badly degraded carbon steel
Mixed with a lead based pullman green paint
Carbon steel
Lead based pullman green
were standard on pullman train cars
Up until let's say the early 1930s
Fdr was elected president in
1932
25 feet underground
a shard of roosevelt's presidential china
Let's put up that map
that is our answer
Track 61
it is been around since the late'20s
you won't find it on many maps
if i got my bearings
we are directly beneath the waldorf astoria
we are
Franklin roosevelt loved staying at the waldorf
his presidential train would come
through grand central directly into this station
that train car up ahead that is part of his train
his aides would whisk him off this train
in his wheelchair into that elevator
over there up to his hotel suite
Out of sight of the press and the public
you are the guy i wanted to sit next to
in history class the day of the test
Good luck trying to cheat off this guy
you will have a tough time finding
Press photos of roosevelt
the press honored his request
never be photographed in his wheelchair
or in his leg braces
Wow that is respect
do not see much of that these days
Part of the train included a dining car with a kitchen
a chef and a wait staff
Well that would explain
a broken china plate or two down here
Looks like sutton's dig site
Looks like sutton was telling
the truth about being chased out of here
Flack
Whoa
Up
Well look at this
Laura roman
i did not kill him
i was in love with him
Well that is a little more than just friends and colleagues
you lied about your relationship with the victim laura
that makes me very suspicious
you do not understand
yes we were lovers but when it came
to archeology and exploring it was a competition
is it possible that competition got a little carried away
no it is not
you left the club
Shortly after sutton did
he ends up dead you find the body
we call that opportunity
then the day after he is murdered
you are underground with a copy
of his map hunting
for whatever he thought was buried down there
we call that motive
the pocket watch you left behind
after you killed him
that was not the big find was it
Stop saying that
i told you
i did not kill him
and i do not know what watch you are talking about
he never told me what he found
so what was james looking for down there laura
he was looking for the remains of a judge
some guy
who disappeared a long time ago
Joseph crater
i was down there
Trying to finish what james started
now i am finished talking
she is telling the truth about the judge
how do you know
the serial number i raised on the watch
Helped me identify an owner judge joseph crater
he was appointed to the new york
State supreme court by then governor
of new york franklin roosevelt
he was like the jimmy hoffa of his day
he disappeared in august of 1930
his body was never found
all right so that is the great
Murder mystery that sutton was hoping to solve
you know before i took that watch apart i had it appraised
it was not worth very much
a couple of thousand dollars at the most
then why would someone attack you
and kill the fisherman for it
because whatever was taken with it
must have been the real prize
you think
Only one way to find out
something definitely hidden inside there
Looks like some kind of coin
Somebody went to a lot of trouble to hide this
yeah
it is got to be valuable
Valuable enough to kill for
we may have just found
our motive for the fisherman's murder
i thought you should see this
Flack subpoenaed sutton's medical history
as expected there was no record
of a previous gunshot wound
but there was documentation of another injury
in 1999
he suffered a fall while
Ice hiking on mount hood
he was airlifted to a nearby hospital
and had emergency surgery to remove his ruptured spleen
now
where is the scar from the incision
there is not one
okay laurie
now please forgive
my use of props but
Seeing is believing
one perfectly
Healthy spleen
this is not the real james sutton
our james sutton
Allow me to introduce myself
my name is james sutton
i am an archeologist
i am 25 years old
i live in a three bedroom
i ran sutton through every database known to man
the usual stuff personal info current and past address
nothing out of the ordinary until i found this
it was posted almost three years ago
my fianc of two years liza
the love of my life
Betrayed me in ways that cannot be forgotten so
okay i do not have a minute adam
Just get to the point here
i promise you boss it is all gonna make sense okay
i will begin an online auction it is coming
Up for sale
my entire life
my possessions
my friends my job
this is the real james sutton
he is been living on long island
for the past three years
he works at the lighthouse museum
on the south shore
Well maybe he can tell us
who the hell is lying on that table down in autopsy
he handed me a check for half a million dollars
his real name is mitch henson
he submitted the winning bid
i know it is a lot of money but
how do you walk away from your entire life
by doing just that
by leaving with the clothes on your back
and a check for 500 000
have you had any contact
with henson since the auction
there was a strict non communication clause
Attached to the sale
what is this all about
is he in trouble or
he was murdered two nights ago
Murdered
Did he ever discuss
with you why he bought your life
i mean could he have been
Running from something or someone
no
from what i remember he was just a plain kind of guy
Just a man looking for a fresh start
okay everybody it is time for the lighthouse tour
i want to take the tour
Well you remember anything else please call
i will
Good luck detectives
Mm hmm thanks
at least we got an id on our vic
Hey
Mitch henson bought sutton's life over three years ago
Sid puts that old gunshot wound
the one that ultimately killed him
Occurring between one and two years ago
okay that means henson was shot both times
Well after he'd already assumed sutton's identity
Grady one more minute and then it is jackson's turn
what are you thinking
if at first you do not succeed try try again
Check this out
Horn honking
is it true
it is all over the club
People are saying he was a fake a fraud
Why do not you have a seat
Take a breath calm down and we will talk
no
i want to know who james really was
where he grew up what college he went to
Did he have any family
Please
it is an ongoing investigation
his name was mitch henson
but apart from that i can not reveal
any further information
you do not understand
i slept with him
i shared secrets with him
for the last three years every time i said his name
it was a lie
Three years
so you were
with him when he was shot the first time
how did you know about that
the coroner found the injury during his autopsy
i need to know who shot him
who was he protecting by not reporting it
Why why is that important
because the person responsible for that shooting
might be the same person who murdered him
i can assure you that it was not
it was you was not it
you shot him
it was an accident
two years ago
i was hired to excavate a site
on a farm outside the city of nicosia in northern cyprus
when i arrived
i realized james had beaten me to the site
He'd been digging there for two days
you son of a bitch
this was mine
i set this up
i did all the legwork
Hey
oh
oh oh oh oh oh
i want everything
everything you found
Just take it easy baby
Just put that thing away
but i never meant to pull the trigger
Thank god he was not seriously hurt
what
nothing
you are very lucky
because that bullet
could have easily killed him
a lot of guys would have told her
she never has to know it was her bullet
that ultimately killed him
what now
the hard part
who is better than me
that depends on who you ask
this pen right here
the most dangerous pen in the world
and the answer to all of our questions
the plastic shards sid pulled from the wound
i reassembled them
from the pen the killer used to make the gun
all the components used to assemble the gun
are common household items
and the rim fire 22 caliber bullet
is for sale in any gun shop
the blue mineral oil
Pretty well made the only defect is
the plastic casing on the outside of the pen extended
Farther than the metal barrel
on the inside
the round exploding out of the barrel caused the extra plastic
to splinter and forced those pieces into the wound
the barrel is a metal tube you can buy
in any hardware store
and it was not designed to fire a bullet
that explains the shallow penetration
no rifling inside the barrel
the bullet did not spin out with increasing velocity
instead it wobbled out and quickly lost speed
Leaving no marks to identify the gun
from which it was fired from
Well there are not many people
Capable of making a weapon like this
this might help narrow it down
all right see the front of the coin
has apollo on it he is the god of light
in greek mythology
on the back
is a chariot being drawn by elephants
if this is authentic it is priceless
what makes it so valuable
Well first of all
it feels like solid gold
and those etchings would date it back
Thousands of years ago
during the reign of king philip ii
this belongs in a museum somewhere
it is definitely the property of the greek government
all right well looks like our boy sutton was involved
in smuggling stolen antiquities then
yeah somebody wanted that coin badly enough to attack me
in that stairwell and kill the fisherman
and that person's still out there
the funny thing about search warrants james
is that you never know what is gonna turn up
now i bet that this
would not be in your apartment
i bet that you were smart enough to get rid of it
i lost
the pen from the lighthouse gift shop
Ironic
Using something from your new life
to take the life of the man who had your old one
Bet that 500 grand
Seemed like a lot of dough at the time huh
Amazing how fast it can go
a bad real estate deal here
a couple of overaggressive investments there
that job you have at the lighthouse
might as well be charity work
you are broke
Did you honestly think that
by killing henson you'd have your life back
i did not want my life back
i just wanted some
Credit some kind of compensation a little respect
he was becoming rich and famous
off of my research my hard work
Henson
you stopped taking my calls
you are not supposed to be here
no contact remember
that is what the contract says
Get the hell away from me
i saw the magazine articles those ruins in peru
Brilliant discovery
a career maker
that is me
i got you there
i sold you my reputation
i sold you my existence no
it was my hard work that got me there
you gave up on your life
and i took it and turned it into something you could not
i do not owe you anything
you could not let it go
James he had
no right treating me like that
he had every right
but in your twisted mind
you somehow blamed him for your own failures
he was the reason your life was falling apart
so you made this gun
you came back to the city and you hung out
Outside the club and you killed him
what the hell are you doing
i told you to stay away from me
i told you what i wanted
you can not have your life back and you
can not have it either
that was my life
that was not your life
this is
and for the next 25 years that life is the property
of the new york state department of corrections
i really appreciate you seeing me at such a late hour
how can i be of assistance
i am conducting a homicide investigation
that may involve the smuggling of artifacts
Belonging to your country
Specifically a rare coin of philip ii
a rare coin indeed
yes
i was hoping
you might put me in contact
with someone from your government
that would be able to inform me
of any recent thefts of such items
Give me a list of known smugglers
I'd also like
to authenticate the coin find out exactly
where it originated
Detective bonasera sebastian diakos
Pleasure to meet you
Sebastian is an antiquities expert
Specializing in ancient greek artifacts
he will assist you with whatever you need
I'd be happy to
oh
you said you had
a photograph of the coin
yes i do
oh
oh i am so embarrassed
i i must've
Picked up the wrong tablet
i do not have the photograph i am looking for
on this one ah
i apologize
i have wasted your time
i uh promise you our next meeting will be
Far more productive
of coursePreviously on Royal Pains
i got your blood results back
uh huh
the anti DNA test came back positive for lupus
in your profession positive is a negative thing
Jack we can fight this together
okay well fight it together later
i have got a lesson
his lupus is more advanced than we thought
it is attacking his kidneys
i will have another check with your parents very soon
i would never have had the courage to end our arrangement
you gave me the chance to move on
you said you wanted to be my friend
be my friend
you know how to be a friend do not you doc
Dialysis
i assumed you knew
Let's go fishing
yes
he never came in for the procedure
Maybe i can find him
you are going to drag him in here
kicking and screaming
if i have to
no luck
Jack's not at any of the fishing spots Jim knew about
all my calls are still going to voice email
he must have gone further out
he is not answering his radio
if he is out there alone and gets weak he may not be able to get himself back
Let's hope he is smart enough to take care of himself
yeah well
i will let everyone know to keep their eyes peeled
you okay
oh yeah
Fine
yeah
Gonna blame that on the sun in your eyes too
what
you have been wincing all morning
every time i ask you about it you blame it on the sun
so i have a headache
Big deal
Let me see this
Hey
Hey
this is not because of my hep C is it
i haven't had any problems since i finished the interferon
it is a simple and common inflammation
Inflamed supraorbital nerve
Yup
here we go
i have never seen such an advanced form of treatment before
Wow
that is better
i am cured
yeah it is not that easy
the ice is temporary relief
i will give you a local anesthetic and an injection of solu medrol to resolve the inflammation completely
Usual payment okay doc
Usual's perfect
i have never seen a doctor paid so promptly
and no paperwork
you ever get paid in pedicures
if you could see my toes you'd know the answer to that
we will find him
yeah i know
i am sure he is fine medically
he just has a tendency to take bad news badly
i am worried this fast progression hit him hard
you guys have become really good friends
yeah
i guess we have
can you think of any other friends who might know where he is
i can think of one
Jack
Jack i got a year's worth of Sushi on the line
a little help
Hang on hang on
Dashing knight in shining armor coming through
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
okay
Come on buddy just give it up
oh my gosh
oh
no
Well
Man
These fish hate us
something we said
Whew
everything okay with Jim
he is fine
Grouchy as ever
you guys find Jack
i called Jill to see if she heard anything got her office and it turns out she went fishing
with Jack
Really
Really
Like fishing fishing
as opposed to what
Absolutely nothing
i am sure that is exactly what they are doing
are you okay with that
Honestly i am just glad he is not out there alone
and she will make sure he gets back for dialysis prep
you got the gift right
the christening's in a few hours and you remind me of this now
you did not get it
you got it
it is a good thing i was in charge of it too
you you would have been scrambling around
Monogram's wrong
no it is not
what
you are missing a V for Von
Carlos Casseras Kuester Von Jurgens Ratenicz
yeah it is C C K J R
you do not put the V
yeah you do
it is not a full last name
it is part of a name
then it should be part of the monogram
it is not a
look the monogram's the least of this kid's problems
his name sounds like a game of drunken scrabble
can you fix it
i gotta meet Boris
oh sure yeah
i will
i will fix it
i will just go grab a needlepoint kit from my hope chest
that would be a lot funnier if you did not have a hope chest
okay here we go
i am back for less than a day and already you have me in your Frankenstein's laboratory
okay
Clench
Unclench
Clench
Unclench
i know it seems excessive but thallium poisoning can cause muscle contractures
the the metal builds up in soft tissue and weakens it
i thought your range of motion tests were inconclusive so this electromyogram will tell me if your muscles are healthy
oh that does not sound good
it is
i want an E M G tech to analyze the results to be sure but you seem to be free and clear of any symptoms genetic or otherwise
i have been investigating your theory that our history of illness may have been the result of shall we say family politics
you do have a genetic mutation
Whether that means you will eventually become symptomatic is a question
Suddenly my future is unwritten
Thank you Hank
any news on the investigation
our friend Dieter is still at large
he had been in my employ in my home for nearly 20 years
i trusted him with everything
you will be attending the christening today
yeah of course
i can not wait
Thank you for inviting us
i must admit Marisa and i have an ulterior motive
oh really
we have discussed the matter and we'd like to ask a great favor of you
would you be our son's godfather
it would be my honor
Good
Man
that fish gave me a workout
it is good i can skip the gym this week
yeah Jack
how are you feeling
Well you know those drug commercials where a reassuring voice comes on at the end and talks about possible side effects
Well it turns out these side effects are very possible
in fact they are probable even because i feel like i have got every last one of them
Did you talk to Dr Greene
Maybe she can give you something
yeah yeah
something with more side effects
i will talk to her
when we go back in
but we are not going back in empty handed
i do not know the fish are too smart or they are too full
Maybe we should call it
Aw not you too
Casey come on
Look the only reason i came all the way out here was to get away from people feeling sorry for me
i feel sorry for me
i could use a shower
yeah
Maybe that is why the fish hate us
okay so home
not yet Jilligan i am feeling lucky

yeah
we do not need a CFO
Just doctors
it is my boss
i am really worried about her
what is it
you should see for yourself
Come on
i will take you to her
Quincy's her name
she is super rad
that is surf lingo i have been trying to learn
Wait till you meet her
oh that is her
Quincy
Quincy
okay you can not hear me
Hey Luke
what is that
this
it is only vitamins
no caffeine
it is just how i am all the time
where was i
Quincy
oh
Did i tell you she got a spot on the junior surf team when she was only 13
oh
Wow
yeah
that is her
Hey
hi
hi
that doesn't look so tough
how come i always see people falling
it is not tough at all with a few short lessons
can i interest you
uh no they are from my aunt Jill's clinic
yeah we are here to help you
with what
Look at that sunburn
it can give her skin cancer
yeah we can take a look at that
any other symptoms
she is also been feeling sick
Luke why do not you give us a few moments of privacy
yeah
Mm hmm
Sure
Bye
uh Quincy is it just on your face and legs
uh some on my shoulders
it itches a little but it won't kill me
okay
Luke mentioned you were feeling sick
a teeny bit of nausea
have you eaten anything unusual today
could you be pregnant
no no no
her boyfriend's been gone on the world surf tour
he is only ranked ninth
Stop eavesdropping Luke
Go welcome the next group of paddleboarders for their lesson
on it Quincy
do not worry
he is a smart obviously energetic kid so i gave him a summer job
he means well
i just try to keep him away from anything he can break tear or destroy
Wow you want i should go keep an eye on him
yeah
do not you break tear or destroy anything either
so back to the pregnancy question
yeah Luke
Luke's right
my boyfriend's been away for a few months
um we take turns competing
so with him gone i have just been working triple time
you know it is probably why i am not feeling well
or your nausea could be caused by the dehydration due to the burn
yeah you got to wear sunscreen every day
Especially since you are outside so much
oh yeah i do
i
i know the drill
how old is your sunscreen
it loses effectiveness over time
you think it maybe went bad
Possibly
we can give you something for the nausea but i think Divya is right
what you really need is to hydrate
i will
i promise
Guess it is a good thing Luke called you guys after all
we won't tell him
okay Jack
it is time to go
no i told you
i am
i am feeling lucky
yeah well you do not look lucky
Casey please stop treating me like a sick person
Problem is you kind of look like a sick person
Well that is just mean
Sorry
so you can drive this thing back to land or i can
what is it going to be
you got a license
i do not need one
which way's the stern
Right there
you are hired
Thank you
Take a little break
um no one's here
Need i point out that we are in fact here
Seriously where is everybody else
Hankmed can not be the only people Boris and Marisa know
Marisa's family's in Cuba Boris' family
Greedy murderers
if you were him you'd err on the safe side too
Wow
Ah
Padrino please we are ready
Godfather coming through
Sorry
Thank you both for being here on this joyous day
i am sorry for interrupting
it is safe to assume this side is family
i did not invite you here
i wanted to
Undoubtedly you want something but you won't find it here
Let's continue shall we
hello everyone
such a small group it will be easy to mingle
uh it seemed like Boris did not really want you here
we have a complicated family
Claudette Von Jurgens his cousin
Nice to meet you
a distant cousin probably right
since you sound French and Boris is
what is he
i am French Swiss
you must be very close to Boris
and trusted
i hope so
Well he made you godfather to his son
that position is usually reserved for family
Especially in our family
Excuse me
you must be Marisa
i am so pleased to finally meet you
of course Claudette
Boris has mentioned you
you would spend your vacation together as children
Your parents would send you to Shadow Pond
that is right
i am touched you hold the memory as close to your heart as i do
it is obvious i purposefully kept the family away from this event Claudette
so what are you doing here
Boris
it is a perfectly reasonable question
the Kuesters and the Rateniczes have always been at odds
while we Von Jurgens remain rather neutral
yeah we do not need a family history lesson
the Rateniczes thought that a christening was the ideal place to extend an olive branch
and they asked me to come thinking me the least threatening messenger
we do not need any messages from the Rateniczes
they are not bad people
all of them
some rogue and off balance family members may have tried to hurt Boris
Claudette
i am not sure what you want
i do not know if you are lying or if you are terribly naive but my son's christening is hardly the time would not you say
of course
i completely understand
i am sure you do
Hey
uh oh no thank you
i won't be staying long
Thank you for meeting me
of course
after talking to Divya about her situation with you
i decided that i should probably get your side of things too
you are worried about her
yeah i am
i must admit i am too but we have an arrangement agreeable for now
she sees me
she gives me what she can
she gives you what is that
a purely financial transaction
we have tried to keep emotion out of it
i thought you were a decent guy Raj
my parents insist it
oh your parents insist it
okay um what kind of screwed up family are you in man
we are talking about Divya's debt to my parents for the wedding
uh yes exactly
that is what we are talking about
Hey
i got your message
Your nausea's worse
yeah
i am dizzy and my heart's racing
like i just took a ten wave set to the head
Well i think you better sit down
can not i have got a group coming in
if i cancel on clients i lose clients
i understand
i was working two jobs recently
i pushed myself so hard that i could not be my best at either
i am just so tired
i am doing my best but i feel i am always catching up
Your eyes they are slightly yellow
what does that mean
it is the beginning of jaundice
it is an indicator of liver infection
what
have you been vaccinated for hepatitis a
no
um no i have heard of hep a in the ocean but there haven't been any advisories anywhere even near here
with hep a in the water they would warn people
a beach closure would completely destroy my business
no one is talking about closures
Divya i am a longboarder
there are barely any sponsors for women surfers
so this shop right now is all i have
there is no retirement plan in surfing
Well i am going to make sure that you are healthy enough that you can retire when you choose
so let's take this one step at a time
first a full blood panel
okay
Hey
i have been trying to reach you guys
how is Jack
not so hot
i had him rest while we head back to shore
how far away are you
Probably about an hour out from north shore dock where we rented the boat
Wait listen Hank
Jack says that these are the side effects of his medication but
i am worried
yeah so am i
Nina hey
Found Jack
Jill says he is sweaty and he is been asleep all morning
before that he was weak and had trouble catching his breath
Well considering his creatinine and B U N numbers
I'd expect him to be fatigued and fluid over load
he is been surprising energetic up until now
yeah i thought so
i just wanted to confirm before i go
Go where
i am going to meet the boat at the dock then i am going to drag his ass over to your office for dialysis prep
Great i just got off work
i will go with you
no no no
do not
i am sure he is fine
i do not want you to waste the rest of your day on my nagging feeling
i will pick you up in ten
Make it five
Wow it is beautiful out here
not a big fisherman woman person
no
the closest thing i ever got to fishing was eating fish sticks
but i do love it out here
Hank i have not been outside of the hospital this much since
i started working in a hospital
Welcome to concierge medicine
i gotta say it is not bad
yeah
Except when you are chasing a patient who is not ready to be helped
you know what
um sell off the JP Morgan high yield a bond then
yeah and transfer the funds to my personal checking account
Great
when will that be available
Tomorrow's perfect
that is perfect
Great give me a call if there is any problem
all right bye
Claudette
you must be lost
uh Boris' house is the gigantic castle next door
is Hank home by any chance
i have a favor to ask
no he is not
oh
Why do you want Hank
Unless it is a medical question
it is not
Maybe you can help
Sure come in
Boris dismissed my terms to negotiate a detente in our family
i understand he is upset and i understand why
oh you mean because people in his family ran his car off the road because they thought Marisa was in it
Actually our friend Jill happened to be in it
which is beside the point because then they tried to poison him
yes and they turned his most trusted employee against him
yeah Dieter
i still can not believe it was him
was he working for them all along
is that whole quiet sidekick thing just an act
were those glasses even real
you know what
never mind
i find it is best to know as little about Boris and his personal life as possible
i want to talk to Boris
i tried to but it seems he is too busy
we used to be very close
and what is happened is inexcusable and unacceptable
but we are family
and that is the most important thing
so why are you here
i was hoping Hank will be willing to give this to Boris
Boris trusts Hank
as well he should
Hank would never betray him
Nor would i ever ask him to
we are all on the same side
Hank me you
if you could ask Hank to deliver this package to Boris today after 5 00 P M
5 00 P M
yes
this is not suspicious at all
Tell him it is a gift from me
it is a gift
huh uh tell me
what does one get the man who has everything
Proof that i want to bring the family together proof that i am empowered to speak on their behalf and proof that i can be trusted
so uh i have no idea what is in there
i have no interest in finding out
Claudette Von Jurgens gave it to me said it was for Boris
a gift
yeah sounded suspicious to me too
Your hep a screen came back negative
oh thank God
but your liver enzymes are highly elevated
i did not even know i had liver enzymes
Your liver is not functioning correctly
i want to take you to Hamptons Heritage for a CT scan rule everything out
everything
Mm hmm
can we go tonight after i close up
I'd rather not
so it is a serious everything
we will not be gone for very long i promise
Did uh Luke get you those bottles
no he gets them from me
may i
he eats what i eat he drinks what i drink
the kid looks up to me
i am not really sure why
Why are you taking two bottles
Well you do not need this much energy
oh yes i do
Quincy how many are you taking in a day
oh um six eight
Maybe ten
so in a day you are averaging 50 hours worth of energy
i have never thought about it like that
i think i know what is wrong with you
Your body may have overdosed on niacin
otherwise known as vitamin B3
it is one of the ingredients in this drink and too much of it can cause a flush that can look like a sunburn and compromise liver function
Wait so did my diagnosis just get better or worse
Better
if you stop drinking these immediately usually your liver heals itself
that is amazing news
so then i do not have to close up shop
Nope
i am afraid not
you still need supportive treatment
you need IV hydration and monitoring of your liver function and healing
it can not wait till tomorrow
i am sorry
oh wait
if i am overdosing on niacin Luke is drinking this too
we should go find him
yeah
Guys i am fine
i sip it do not really like it very much
i was closing down the wet suits and could not help but overhearing your
you mean eavesdropping
anyway my aunt Jill is pretty awesome
Runs the hospital
i will make a few calls pull some strings and i know you are worried about the shop but i promise you Quincy
i will take really good care of it
i will be a great salesman a trusted cashier and i won't break anything
i swear
Hey
Hey Jack
Hey
Hey bud
they say the best way to a fisherman's heart is through his fly
Jack we need to get you off this boat
yeah Jill did not care for that one either
i am fine
Jack we need to get you to a hospital
the nearest level one is Greenport Medical about an hour away
that is too far
i will get them here as fast as i can
Jack
Whoa whoa whoa
Jack
he is very tachypneic and cyanotic looking
i hear rhonchi
his heart sounds are muffled
is there a pulsus paradoxus
no radial pulse
yeah probably is
he has jugular venous distention
it is all the signs of a cardiac tamponade
if we do not get the fluid building up around his heart drained he is going to arrest
i will start the IV line
Ambulance will be here in less than 20
he doesn't have that much time
we gotta drain the fluid here
you are going to do a pericardiocentesis right here on the dock
yeah
we do not have a choice
okay here it is
Ah okay
oh Panky is the whole stabbing in the chest thing really necessary
i thought we were friends
i am going with Jack
i will call you later
how you doing
can not complain
Hey doc let me ask you something
on a scale of one to two how bad
it is better now
not good yet
you should have gotten the treatment
Dr Greene told you you needed
Maybe i messed up a little
can i ask you something else
yeah
Go to the dock to meet me or was i just some excuse to get some quality dockside time with Dr Nina Greene
Believe it or not it was to see you and for some reason Nina insisted on joining me
i mean you ruined a perfectly good day for both of us
yeah i have that effect on people
now might be a good time to stand
you are falling
Stop
this is nowhere near as easy as Quincy made it sound
Evan this was your idea
i know
it is not natural
Unless you are a gondolier it is just showing off
who cares
who cares
then why did you insist on Quincy paying Hankmed back with paddleboat lessons
and why did not you want to wait for her to get out of the hospital tomorrow so that she could teach us herself
because i did not want to cut into her paying customers' time
she seemed pretty concerned with keeping her business afloat
so to speak
you know financial pressure can be pretty overwhelming at times
Evan
what
oh you mean kind of like your deal with Raj's parents
Just what do not walk away
yes you have conveniently made that impossible haven't you
now i understand why we are here
okay here is what i have been thinking
Five truly terrifying words
i have given this a lot of thought
so as you know Hankmed is a family business founded by two brothers and a Divya
yes i remember
in all this time you have become not only one of my closest friends but also a part of my family
and when you broke off your marriage with Raj it was one of the most courageous things
i have ever seen
and what did it get you
Your parents cut you off and his parents stuck you with the wedding bill
it is not right
Thank you Evan
Truly
but friends lending friends money never ends well
how about family lending family money
Worse
i knew you'd say that and i am nothing if not prepared
so here is my pitch
i buy your 1 3 stake in Hankmed
Evan
it is not a loan
that is very generous but i brought up selling my shares to Hank and he said that i should keep them
and i totally agree
the moment you can buy them back they are yours again
in the meantime i promise to take very good care of them
Just think about it
you have two minutes
Thank you for all your help Dr Lawson
we received the report from dispatch
i will let you know as soon as he is in recovery
Thanks
oh so you got it
i am so glad
that is great
yeah i was not really sure of the best means to get something to you so i was going to call your cell phone but then i realized i do not even have your cell phone number which is actually kind of funny if you think about it
my cousin gave you this
she did and she said to give it to you which is which is what i did
Did you look inside
i would never
no
i brought it right to your security apparatus
you know the big scary dudes
look like they kill people for kicks
so it is not a device is it
i mean it is obviously a device but not one that explodes
okay
the newspaper
so German's actually one of the many languages
i do not speak
Mr Lawson i have read that front to back and have found nothing that in anyway concerns me
what exactly did Ms Von Jurgens say about its significance
nothing she seemed frustrated that you did not take her offer seriously and was very intent on me delivering it to you today after 5 00 P M
5 00 P M
Sounded suspicious to me too
the evening update
Dieter
oh my God that is Dieter in cuffs
and he is still wearing his glasses
Wait a minute
what does this mean
it means cousin Claudette is invited to dinner
Hey
Hey
so i just spoke with your doctors
they are encouraged by the results
they want to monitor you overnight but they hope to release you tomorrow
it is good news
but Jack it is time to get serious about dialysis okay
this was way too close a call
Dr Greene is setting up your dialysis prep surgery at Hamptons Heritage
Hank
what do you say after the surgery i take you fishing
yeah I'd like that
yeah
Fishing
you are still here
Sorry you are not getting rid of me so easy
Hank
i am sure
i am sure there are more than enough medical professionals to keep an eye on me overnight
i am sure there are
i am not staying as your doctor
i am staying as your friend
Hank Hank
yeah
what is up
they say that if you give a man a fish he will eat for day but if you if you teach a man to fish he will sit on a boat and drink beer all summer
is that what they say
True story
Thanks for being at the dock
Thank you for coming
to say i was surprised by your message would be an understatement
it is everything
all of it
Divya i know the financial position you are in
you do not have to
i want to
i need to
i understand
Thank you for understanding
and for doing everything you could to help me with this
you did not have to
it means so much
i wish i could have done more
oh and Raj please give your parents my regards
i will
Hopefully Hank is finishing the paperwork and we can take Jack back to Hamptons Heritage
Let's make sure he gets the best room in the house
every room's the best room
it is because of you
Whoever replaces you has big shoes to fill
there he is
Hank
Hey there
how is Jack
it happened so fast
he went septic
we could not get to him
we lost him
Jack's dead
Sync and corrected by atrn97g www addic7ed comyou are not looking well
Did everything go all right at Monte Carlo
and Pierre
Pierre
do not worry it is not love any longer it is passion on his part of course
no i will take the overnight bag
so you have found real happiness
Real security at least
for a woman happiness is security my dear and nothing more believe me
then i am perfectly happy
Corinne Corinne my angel
Jean Marc
you must have woken up at dawn to meet me here
i hadn't even gone to bed it was a positively daft night
she looks so gorgeous
and Pierre how is he
i adore Pierre
he is remained unpretentious even with so much money
that is the reason why we all love him
Right Corinne
of course
if you do not like children like i said you only have to switch carriages
at this age they have got to cry it gives them lungs
Come dear precious one
Thank you Madame
i hope she did not keep you much from sleeping Madame
on the contrary
she is like a lullaby this mournful one
you must not exaggerate
Your husband's champing at the bit
that would astound me
Thank you Madame
Goodbye
Goodbye Madame
Goodbye Madame
Goodbye Monsieur
does she have a sister
you are taking me for a Yankee are not you
was the Riviera lovely
of course it was lovely
Wow
what a change from Grenelle
and the house
my inheritance
my poor aunt had good taste
a lovely garden
Thank you
Hit for God's sake hit
there straight like that you have got it
Come on
Harder
Hit harder i tell you come on
you will kill the child
yes of course it is me
what is the time then
a good half hour past my train's scheduled arrival
Well and you could not have said it was that late
i did not know Monsieur Le Garrec
Shadow box for a bit i am coming back
you are robbing the cradle now
so i wanted to pick you up at the station you know
i mean it except this is the only time the kid could train
of course
yes
and you is everything fine
yes
so
tell me how your Riviera trip went
Like a dream
it is perfectly sunny there with flowers everywhere
Hey they say you have wings and you float through the mimosa plants
Victor we would both have it good there
you can see my face floating in the mimosa
Think about it for me Paris is the only place where i can float and you too
you would not survive far from Paris
Paris was good when i was 20 years old because today to get me to imagine any of this street or your club you talk about a horizon and perfume
Victor your club smells foul
Like cold sweat and used ambergris you have already told me
i know
yes well it is a bit untidy
Did you invite the French army
do not be dramatic
they were kids who came for supper one evening
because when i am not here you feed them and put them to bed
it is not a club any longer
it is an asylum
would it harm their training to wash the dishes
Hey do not complain smile a little i haven't seen you for a long time
Being an heiress suits you
you are ravishing
you are mad i am worn out from the journey
Look at my eyes
it is not terrible for such a beautiful couple to have a row
you know how to tease
Maybe we are not in the bloom of youth but despite everything we are not so bad
will you stay with me this afternoon
no i can not
i am obliged to go to Htel Dieu Hospital
Roger's been in an accident at the factory
Very well go see Roger
you know i won't be bored
i have something to amuse myself
i am only telling you what i see here
Roger Routier Saint Grme Lyon room deceased on the 8th day before yesterday
Look here it is not possible a 23 year old kid
Well then
Fortunately death only happens to old people
so what kind of accident did he have
you know what he died of right
of 23 years being flat broke
because he'd found he'd had enough he chose a dangerous trade
it pays better
he only forgot one thing there are machines that do not like it when you brush past too close
he was your mate
was yes
and you are you family
no he did not have any family
Well if that is the case it is still the state that is going to pay
Madame Bourgois which room is it
one person at a time
Lf you would like details
Thank you details won't be necessary
as you like
what name had you said
Bourgois Emilie
Date of admission
September 28th
Hey boy here
Thank you Monsieur
you are not going to start blubbering are you
i need more of that
Nice spot eh
we have everything we need to be happy
the good Lord bobbies the hospital
it is well organised
and for the bloke those things do not satisfy there is always the Seine
you do not find that funny
no it is not my style of humour
are you Victor
that is me
Roger often spoke of you
He'd say that you were a kind chap
Well i try
he would even say that when you weren't around
will you come for a juice
What'd you like
two white coffees please
would you like a bite to eat
what do you think
i have already eaten
me too that is doesn't stop me
Go on
These were for Roger
you can have them
Why you are not interested
you do not do sport
i did a bit of boxing in the regiment
oh really
that is where Roger and i met
we were both lightweights
Did you fight any matches
Ten or so in Hanoi Saigon
it looked like I'd have a future
Roger too
because youths have futures or so they say
but now you have let it go you do not train any longer
are you scouting for your club
no young lad
i was only asking out of sympathy that is all
because you looked regretful
Am i right
yes i let it drop
it was not compatible with my jobs
Well with such a dark sense of humour you must not be too happy then
if one evening you are really depressed come by the gym
here the address is inside
there are good lads there and also if you want to train you will see
a good sweat fixes everything believe me
and trust me i won't charge you
for you it is free
what is this
Your change
he was a nice young chap and serious too
he was just about to go professional but then
Poor boy
what is more he is the only one i can really rely on because the others
the others are generally washouts
but do not complain
you like that well enough
Relax Blanche come on
it is true
they have not only got to have months of training but you even give them crpe bandages and gum shields
they will never come to anything so what is the use in helping them
it helps misfit youths keep out of trouble and what is more it gives them a bit of hope
you see Angelo what a heart this man has
Victor's a real parish priest but parish priests do not have wives and from time to time they take up a collection
if he weren't so stubborn the house i inherited in Nice
here she goes again
it is been the same old tune since this morning
we sell the gym and get a business on the Riviera
it is a good idea
in the sun
the sun the sun i would look handsome as master bather
no he prefers to stagnate here
he dreams of training a champion
for years i have tolerated this we could have done otherwise but now
now she has an inheritance
since she got a villa among the mimosa the boxer disgusts Madame
the boxer
i loved it when you boxed
you weren't afraid for him
the fear was overwhelming but it was good
Ah that is when i could be proud of him
but i could never get used to the club
i think it is the smell
Angelo
you are boring the people with your trifles
you are like an old man
it is my stomach Angela
it is not your stomach it is fatigue
i have already told you to get an assistant
but Angela i could not pay one
and when will you pay the doctor
but Angela i am not
no no no
Tomorrow i will find your assistant even if the trip's only to the Halles it is decided
so a bit of grappa
a taste
a little taste
a little taste
hello Madame Victor
Jojo
you look guilty what did you do
nothing Madame
what is this did she scratch you
Well she really likes me
yes and you will never go professional that way
Hop to it go train
do not say anything to Monsieur Victor
is Victor here
Monsieur Le Garrec
yes he is here
it is for coal
no
i just came from work
so did the others
hello Louison
are you over your cold
Nearly Madame Le Garrec
do not catch a chill
he is in the gym
Thank you Madame
you are welcome my boy
Left hook Pierrot
that is it
Stop
Hey
Did you come to show me your skills
no i am just stopping by i do not have my things
Well we can find you something
Come with me
do you have Roger's gear
Roger's
yes this is his mate
in the changing room in his locker number 7
the changing room is there and you have got the showers there
where did you find this one
Htel Dieu Hospital
he says he knows how to box
i know
he is a champion in the making he is oozing with talent won't have to pay is not that right
Right take it easy
do not bash him up i do not know if it is worth it
Strike a bit anyways but not enough to put him off
yes Monsieur Victor
Get out of the ring
here is your champion
you come here
Go through
Hey your abs are a bit loose eh
got to work on that
Go on fight him
do not brawl like that Pierrot
Box
that is good enough
Enough
you are pleased with yourself eh
Well old man that was nothing to speak of because you are stiff you are tense so you are short of breath see
what is more you are in a temper
it is very nice to throw big whammies in boxing but above all you must avoid receiving them understand and i myself will teach you that
yes my boy whether you like it or not
i am taking you into my own hands
then expect to have a hard time of it
Right then i hope you will do these gloves credit because Roger promised to you know
i will try Monsieur Le Garrec
there you have it
no not like that
Lengthways i tell you
never before a boxing match
Look at that how nervous they are
it is always like that in the suburbs we can not control them any longer
will you come with us gorgeous
we are all going to box at Melun
you can ring the bell
i prefer the Palais des Sports and the champions
us too but we will get there
yes but while you are waiting to be a champion eat a little will you
Thanks again for the lorry
can you feel it clearing
can you breathe better
he caught another chill
Well take him with you to Nice
he will be warm
who is the bastard who pinched my gum shield
you are crazy
do not tire yourself out Pierrot good God
because i told you he is penniless i know
i boxed against him in Pantin
and in the first round he lit into you
not the first the second
are not you ready to go yet
we are ready Monsieur Le Garrec
Right off you go good God
the suitcase i forgot
Scared out of your wits
a bit
Feel like you are on form
you are certain i am
do not stress about it
it is the first match that we are doing together
Believe me it favours us
Come on you will see everything will go well only just watch your left okay
Monsieur Mnard the bobbies came and carted off three more of them
and then
a night strike it seems
Talk about an unsavoury clientele
it fills up your hotel doesn't it
Five blokes per room and only one bed that doesn't satisfy you
are not we nasty
is there anything you need
yeah to see some other ugly mugs
Undoubtedly you are lacking manners
you shove off after losing a match without saying goodbye to anyone not even to me
Days go by no one sees you again and then when i come here to find you
i find you being rude to a woman who wishes you well
do you think that is acceptable
all right be polite for once tell me to come in
Madame
a real gem
what i like the best is the view
there is fresh air it is healthy
then there is music
it is cheery
i did not ask you to come
that is exactly what i am blaming you for
so my boy
so what
Go on
you did not come for a tour
i am listening to you but i warn you if you came to tell me to put my gloves back on it is not worth the trouble
Well now your landlord was right
you are boorish
but there is more you are arrogant and a sensitive sissy
yes you are a perfect sissy
you could not bear to lose a match
it happens imagine that even to champions and what is more you will lose other matches and if you have to pull out each time
that is not why i pulled out there is another reason
all right explain yourself
what is the use
Listen to me you have never wanted to tell me any details about your life but today you will talk because maybe you are hard headed but i am a Breton believe it or not
so go on i am listening
Explain what
i am fed up with everything
i never succeed
i ruin everything
i always have
i should not have listened to you because now it is even worse
the first match i had to lose that one too
and then after you fought in other matches in the regiment and then you won them
yes but in the regiment i ate every day
it may not be first rate but it keeps one going
the army's at least good for that
you told me you were working
Certainly i am working
but this wretched bed i have got to pay for it do not i
and to do that you skip meals
that is why you fight two rounds and by then everyone's gone huh
how much do you earn at your railway
Minimum wage
yes clearly it is exactly that
is it an exhausting job
a bit yeah especially when a person works nights
i am screwed
i can not go to the club any more
i can not box
i am too worn out
i can not
i can not
Well then you haven't got a choice we will go to extreme measures
Come on get up and pack your trunk
to go where
Listen i told you I'd take you in hand
so we are going to change all this and first of all
i am going to find you another job that is less tiring
what is it that you want
what do you mean what do i want
because these kind of good works free gifts i do not trust them
there is no such thing
Right old chap
i have to be a strange sort of saint to put up with you
i am not giving you a gift
it might even be you who is giving me one
but i have a daft idea i tell you
i would like to train a great boxer and maybe with you i have found one
so everything i am going to do for you is because it puts my life back together too
it is a trade
it is acceptable that way is not it
i could really become a great boxer
yes perhaps if you listen to me
but i warn you it takes a lot of work
Hey you should never toss out a lucky charm it could be useful
Excuse me
i did not think of putting any flowers
i do not know how to be a hostess
i haven't had guests for a long time
i believe it'd be better for me to get back to my luxury hotel
it is silly but i do not like to bother people
do not be offended you are not the one i am angry at
Your parents are in Provence
during the war they lived in La Chapelle
one evening the neighbourhood got blown apart
the bomb that wiped out the building was not an atomic bomb but for them it might as well have been
i survived with my skin and got myself out
and since then
Ever since
Life goes on
Monsieur Mnard
Victor's asking for you
i think Papa's going to hire you but it was not easy to convince him
i am coming
it is the shop right next door
you ought to tell him you think he is a handsome kid
he is not bad but boxers do not interest me
you are a smart girl
Being a boxer's wife is not a life it is an apostolate
shall i tell you about my wedding night
do not be embarrassed
i spent it putting compresses on his eye
' cause as for rolling in the hay forget it it is like sauces and outings forbidden because of training
he doesn't box any more
no
he searches for young hopefuls
but when it becomes this serious
i believe I'd still prefer him to have a round robin
Breathe deeply and exhale strongly at the end
you need to work on your breathing
is that enough for this morning
i will tell you when you are finished
if you do not want to suffer become a bureaucrat not a boxer
if you want to become a champion set your jaw
Hit good God
Hit
you have got feather dusters instead of fists
Go on
Tell yourself you are beating up your troubles
Come on hit me up here
you are stiff as a block of wood
Come on hit further out
now the abdominals
Smoothly
do not let your arms fall
Speed up your rhythm
Again
Hit harder i say
you look like you are going on a stroll
do not use your legs like that
Go on i will count
you got it
Raise your knees to work on your breathing
Higher
Faster you are slacking off
Faster
with your right now
Harder
with your shoulder the bloody right
there less tense and your trap there
i will give you one myself
Come on right hook left hook
one two
Well done that is enough
if i am ever to succeed it might not be worth the trouble of knocking myself out
it is been a long time since you have talked rubbish
you have been needing that
Very good you are getting better
are you happy
you have clearly made progress but do not puff yourself up because the world championship is not around the corner
when will i be able to go professional
next season or the one after that depends on you
and what then
you will be one and you will be like the boys
you will continue to work because boxing won't feed you at first
Later maybe if you become famous but for every one that succeeds you know
and then all the same famous or not there will always be training
Boxing's like that old chap it is no joke
you need courage and a strong will
you think you will have had enough
Lf i knew i were certain to
Well you can be certain
you have a nice smile but show it so rarely old chap
Dinner will be served when these gentlemen want to come to the table
Go on shower quickly
you know Blanche that kid's a real find
i have already heard that somewhere
but i think i have made a mistake because he acts tough like that but in reality you can not rush him
you have got to encourage him instead talk to him know what i mean
you know at your age i did not have a job
i trained i did not know how i would turn out and then i came across a former boxer who trained me
he did for me what i am doing for you now
Thanks to boxing and to him i pulled through
it is not Peru of course but it works
Look at all the kids who come here
they are all misfits
what kind of work has Jojo got
he is a labourer
Raymond's a delivery boy
Pierrot's a docker at Bercy
so do you know why they like boxing
and you
Why do you think you like it
because i have got nothing going for me besides my strength
it is the only career where i have a chance to make something out of myself
yes that is possible but there is another reason
in boxing the bloke in front of you is just like you he is naked and the best man wins
so there is no more problem it sorts out a person's true merits
you understand
with those wise words good night
Thanks
Sleep well
Victor
yes
Jules made me an offer
it doesn't surprise me from that bastard
you want me to smash his face in
he is prepared to take over the club for us
Right
had he been drinking
one month ago you agreed to it
we would sell everything and go to Nice
Right well we are not going any more
i see that
you think you have found the one in a million all because he fought one match
Only one which he lost
what a thing to go into raptures over
do not make a big deal of it he will win the next ones
that remains to be seen
if i understand correctly i won't count on it
Victor it is been years since i agreed religiously to all your whims
for once I'd like you to give a little thought to me
Listen Blanche
i love you very much and as a lover you are not bad but i have one criticism to make and it is a sizeable one
you will never be a great boxer
hi there Madame Blanche
is Victor waiting for me
what else do you want him to be doing
Just leave it i will do it
you are late for jogging
Thanks see you soon
that young man has really changed
he used to be sad and scarcely spoke
is it okay like this
Good
i have noticed that Victor's changed as well
they say he is gotten younger
Really
215 francs
this young lad's so nice
he will be good company for you both
it is certain that he takes up some space
i have always said to Angelo Victor needed a son
he would have taught him his trade
he would have passed on to him
yes it is possible but he needs to come to terms with life because that did not work out
you need to start watching what you eat mate no more bread and no more drinking with meals
you have got to lose a bit more to get down to 63 kilos
this morning i am working with you
on Sunday eight days from now you will box at Central
that is right but do not get nervous and avoid black thoughts especially because this time i am confident about you
you were confident about me the other match too
Come on now do not talk rubbish at that time your muscles were weak and you had poor breathing
Look how in shape you are now
and your mental state
is that the same
no you are a different chap you are a completely new man
you are not in any danger
i am sure you have got enough breath for 15 rounds and what is more that will only be the beginning of a brilliant career i guarantee that too
we will both go far
for one I'd do everything for that
Even if i have to get myself in hot water with my bourgeois wife
you said Sunday eight days from now
what date is that
the 26th does that suit you
that is funny
that is my 24th birthday
Well then we will celebrate your birthday with a satisfying win
do not you think that is a nice birthday present
Sure but it would've been nice to have had a present the first time the other day
Hey Dd shall we have a drink before going home
Order me a Vittel i am coming
would not you like something harder
i can not i am training
Sport is idiotic
do you know what the Yank wants with his oysters
Chocolate but despite her zibeline she is horribly miserable
she performs miracles to keep her yacht
two Beaujolais
and one Vittel
Tell Ren all the right people are here this evening
they must've come from the fur coat ball
Look here good thing i wore mine
do you have my Vittel
have you seen the old woman
she looks like a Sioux
i am certain of it it is mad carelessness
Chantal are they dangerous
Terribly
there is criminal activity here nearly every evening
i knew it
they are extremists are not they
Jean Marc you have brought us to a horrible place
an old fashioned one is worse it is really a charming party
Jean Marc my dear these men scare me
one should never be afraid of men
Really they are wonderful
have you seen that fur lined jacket
the child Hercules
Jean Marc mind your manners
he is looking at our jewellery
no they are admiring you
besides i am going to speak to them
Jean Marc are you drunk
Look at those stained aprons
what a print for a summer outfit
and that boy with that fur lined coat
the chap's crazy he is
Jean Marc lower your voice
Jean Marc i assure you there is a riot brewing
that is how stories come to be
Didi eat
do not be stupid
you haven't photographed a single dress of mine this evening it is sabotage
there weren't any
oh
what about this one
it is our masterpiece
Right
shall we shove off
all right
i have a marvellous idea
Watch the boys
Especially the fur lined jacket
a connection
that is funny i think i know her
you met her playing golf
are you coming
no i will stay a while
Good luck
Good evening
oh Corinne that would be sensational
and you certainly owe me that at the price i sell you my dresses for
because you ask me so tactfully
do you want to
that would be grotesque
it is for his dress and then we could also say who you are we will talk about the shop
if it is for our publicity
Corinne is a dear
Didi quickly get your camera ready
i am going to talk to that boy
Naturally she got there first
they want to take a photo of this dress for an American magazine
Dining at the Halles and i need a partner
Excuse me sir
there stuffed like this the sewing will look awful
is he always this hyper
this evening he is rather calm
you want to right
Lf it would please you
you are an angel
is it all right like that
one moment
Sublime and so Harper's Bazaar
Kiss her that would make you look more like a family
Thank you that fur coat's got a big mouth come have a cocktail
i have drinks not cocktails
Drink oh i just love slang well then let's all have a drink
no no no we have already delayed him and he is working
Right right i do not want to force him
but i am working too if you believe that balls amuse me
Excuse me but i have to be off
Hey you lost this once
Well indeed
how did you know it was mine
have we met before
Once from afar
Bring the gentleman if you do not want to leave him but do come
Corinne bring him here that would be charming
he exasperates me
i have a terrible headache
i am dead tired this will last for hours more and it is like this every night
Having a bit of cash's torturous is not it
Earning it sometimes is yes
Corrine do not be so careless
Go say goodbye and hightail it out of here
i will take you home if you like
would that suit you
Actually it is not a bad idea
it is not a four star Cadillac it is a small lorry
you are not afraid of getting dirty
that is the kind of thing that is never frightened me
Corrine do we have to beg you
Walk to the door i will follow you
Finally
i am so sorry to leave you so early but a well bred gentleman noticing that i was fatigued
and offered me a lift home
you do not want to do that
she should leave her mink coat here she is going to get murdered
are you crazy
do you know Jean Marc
all of Paris will know about this by morning
i do not care about Paris
and you do not care about Pierre either
they will love telling him everything
so let them tell him
i want to have a life
have as much of a life as you want once he is married you but not now
i am open minded but leaving like that with any old person
she loves this kind of scandal but she will be terrified if she doesn't see our car in five minutes
the bill hurry
John pay quickly
we are leaving
your smile was so pretty but if this morning i had been told that one day i would tell you about my life
so i must have irritated you with all my stories did not i
not at all
it was a bit sad at first but it soon became refreshing
Refreshing
yes and you are refreshing
do not get angry it is a compliment
Did you really say number 17
it is a shop
the apartment is above it
it is charming
do you want to see it
Excuse me but i do not have time and
and you should get some sleep
Obviously i can not force you but there is one thing I'd like to know
are you stupid or pathologically timid or am i particularly ugly this morning
but
no i am
what were you saying a moment ago about your training
no tobacco
what else
no tobacco no alcohol no
no women was that it
because
all the same
it never even occurred to me that a girl like you
i am dying of cold make up your mind
i have decided
Did i shock you
me
i have seen too much for that
but i did not know society women
and now you know they just breathe sincerity very forthright
Well we have failed no point in making a scene off you go now
it is perhaps better that way go on
Farewell
do not hold it against me
and thank you for taking me home
i had a lovely time
Wait
this time i am the one who gives it to you
i will take it to Central on Sunday for the match
Good luck
it is so kind of you to have come
i am sure you were worried
Corinne was he at least polite
how beautiful
such warm wool
the boy will be happy
for a boxer the first dressing gown means a lot
i still remember mine did i ever know how to show it off
Tell me Maria it is true that it won't trouble you to embroider his initials then
on the contrary
i would have asked Blanche but at the moment the shock might overwhelm her and so
but can you do it for him for tomorrow
of course
the birthday dinner will be at your place
in principle yes but Blanche
we could do it here
shall we come back here together after the match
Certainly if that won't trouble you
Bother us
but it is for Dd is not it Angelo
yes why not
is it a big match
no i should not exaggerate
it is an amateur fight three rounds of three
no but for the kids it is a big deal to box at Central it is like a kind of dedication
and then the audience there is tough they judge the boxers in less than two rounds
it is important to Dd is not it
Ah you figured that out
i think it is very important
what is more i know him if he loses this one he will ditch boxing
Well actually
i think that you can get the champagne out for tomorrow
we will both be entitled to it
Right then goodbye
Goodbye
Victor
there is a package here for you
do not shout
Dd's getting some kip he hasn't got nerves while he is sleeping
Nerves
you have more nerves than he does
Maria just brought this in
it seems there will be a blow out tonight
to celebrate what
Burying your delusions
Good God what did that kid ever do to you
he is a bother you hear
he is a bother
he is not the first i have bailed out
you did not do this much for the others
the others perhaps weren't as valuable as he is
do not talk about his worth until after tonight
Admit it
you felt sorry for him
you take an interest in others besides him
he is got you twisted around his little finger and that is why i want him to lose
may someone smash in his ugly mug so that you will understand and sober up
are you going mad or what
you are jealous are not you
and why not
the others must really like him as well with his monogrammed dressing gown while they only have the right to hand me down robes
Stop speaking ill of him
what is more it is his birthday
the party's for that too
Well then i would've made a wish for him
i will make some now then and all through the fight as well
it is like a cartoon
what is with these two limp piles of lettuce
Stop the slaughter
Send the ref to the cemetery
is he meditating this morning
and when i think how my wife believes i am having a good time
Did you ring up your right hook on the telephone
Stash away your tie ref
it is like a cartoon
Come on Mickey
Hey Popeye did you forget your spinach
Right this one's ours lad
if your kid wins and he is as good as you say maybe we will be able to arrange something better
all right we will see after the match
Go on lad we will show them what you can do now
hello hello
Winner Lemaire
you are all right
you feel good
you are acting strange
i am fine
Go Dd
Your husband
they are not going to be that nasty to him are they
it all depends on how well he fights
Above all do not stiffen up and do not be nervous because he is nothing special
hello hello second match amateur lightweight in three rounds of three minutes each
Andr Mnard Grenelle sporting club 63 kilos 200 against Pietro Mancini Montreuil league 63 kilos 700
is the other small kid a Sicilian
Why be worried about a Sicilian
Andr Mnard
Pietro Mancini
the third referee for this match is Monsieur Tromlet
do not worry it will go well
the boys are on your side
first round
what are you waiting for Dd
it is starting off well
Blond kid
are you going to do him any damage before the day's over
Come on Dd
Attack
hello hello
for wrongfooting a 300 Franc bonus to Mancini
Back off back off
Turn turn
Go on
Hey dwarf hen move around a little
all right Dd
React
Dd
Quickly
Attack him Dd
what is this madness
he won't hang on
he hasn't got any guts
have you got any guts
Come on hit him Dd
hello hello from the sports bar a 200 Franc bonus for the winner
Corinne my dear the match started a long time ago
i am sorry but Chantal's aeroplane was terribly late
what an odd place
yes yes
i have only seen a boxing match once before
it was stupidly elegant
Wait who is boxing
a handsome dark haired lad
i love dark haired men
is it Sugar
Robinson
he is a splendid champion
Cover yourself and when he comes in wear him down with your uppercut
you have only got to follow him calmly and as soon as you find an opening throw a left hook in his face he doesn't like that
Work him hard lad
you have got to win right
and second round
Go Dd
i do not know why but today Dd's morale's really low and everything's going downhill because of it
Look how beautiful her hat is
Check out the bird
Check out the feather
if i had a bird like that I'd have stayed home on Sundays
Come on Dd
Hit back
Go Dd
down low
Come on follow up
hello hello a 200 Franc bonus to Mnard
hello hello from the restaurant Les toques a 500 Franc bonus to share between the two boxers
Fight fight
Come on Dd
Hit him Dd
hello hello from an anonymous donor a 200 Franc bonus to Mnard
Bravo
we must congratulate him
after the match you are not at the musical
Bravo
the brute jabbed me in the liver
Bravo kid keep it up i will revive you
but do not slack off
you have got him right where you want him
Follow him
Keep hitting high every time
i have just got to win
of course you will win just loosen up
Breathe deeply my God
Let yourself go man
Let yourself relax i tell you
you have got him i tell you
he is wasted but follow him keep at him
i am pleased with you kid
Third and final round
when is it gonna happen
Quiet in the peanut gallery
Come on follow him hit him
hello hello from an anonymous donor a 300 Franc bonus to the winner of the round
Very good Andr
Hit him hard
he is sublime we have got to do something
i do not know what maybe throw flowers
do you have a spring under your ass
Mnard Mnard
Mancini Mancini
Fight fight
Well done kid you were top notch
Listen i have never heard that for an amateur
hello hello
Andre Mnard winner
Bravo Dd
Go on greet them future champion
the apartment's a bit strange do not you think
Actually it is an addition to the shop
Haute poque curious trinkets surrealist bric a brac to impress the multimillionaires
the more expensive it is the more they buy
they are wrong to do so
Between the two of us none of it is authentic
it is all fake
Especially me
and how does that benefit you
to defend myself
Life has taught me that sincerity doesn't pay
Life has taught you a lot of things
Enough for me to distrust it
and is all this yours
no it belongs to my friend Chantal
i take care of sales the social side of the business
Chantal is always travelling
she plunders the countryside looking for all these dreadful trinkets
it is an ideal partnership
i see
no you do not see
Plus everything is much more complicated than that
to the winner
to the melancholy winner
me
not at all
are you laughing at me
no it is just me
i remind myself of a category four femme fatale the evil woman who leads the good young boxer astray
does this kind of love at first sight happen to you often like at the Halles
or am i privileged
Good manners would dictate that
i do not give a damn about manners
Answer me
no it happens very far from often
Normally i have a much steadier head
any more questions for me
it is silly but i prefer it that way
no it is not silly
it is even rather agreeable
and you
what about your life
Boxing
no true love affairs
Boxing
and besides boxing
besides boxing
Boxing
that is all i have got
it must be good to love something that much
it is wonderful
i understand
i understand to the point that i am going to show you real generosity
Andr go join them
Join who
the ones who love boxing as much as you do
the friends i dragged you away from after the match
Tonight your place is with them
my place
I'd like to know where my place is
no
i think even if you hadn't come
i would not have gone with them
and yet
Yet
Yet there is one who must be waiting for me who must be calling me every name in the book
Your manager
how did you know
you haven't stopped talking about him since we left Central
Listen if you want it as much as i do we will see each other again but it is the normal thing for you to go back and find them
you really get it
i told you life has taught me many things
Go they are waiting for you
he is yes but not his wife
i am a burden to her
and i won i want to be happy i do not want to be a burden
if you hadn't come along i would have lost and because of her
i could feel her there cursing me
but seeing you there gave me a boost and i won you understand
i won
Tonight i can not share a table with someone who doesn't like me
Did they plan a celebration for your win
yes and for my birthday
Pardon me
it is your birthday
yes but it doesn't matter
a birthday's always a significant day
how old are you
Twenty four
and you
one doesn't ask a lady her age
around the same age but for a woman that is often worth double
you know how to talk
what does that mean in French
Happy birthday
Andr i am happy you are staying with me
you can not hold it against him it is typical at his age
what is more it was a surprise
we did not tell him about it
Well then good night
Good night
Good night do not worry about it he will be there tomorrow
he missed out the dinner was awfully good
Good night
Good night
you bitch did you know what you were doing shoving off like that just when i was looking for another match for him
that is your job he had finished with his he won
Thanks to who
are not i the one who made him what he is
he never said otherwise
what are you complaining about
you found your one in a million but that kind has a way of taking off
it is only a matter of time
are you a manager or a babysitter
you are too sentimental Victor
do you find women and friendship are damned nuisances
yes when they turn men into idiots
there are times when i want to give you a swift kick in the behind
Friendship is just like love
it often only goes one way
Victor
do not say anything to him when he gets in and he will get it that is how it works and you will look good
Good Morning
Good Morning
you were watching me sleep weren't you
was i not permitted to
i detest that
one can not defend oneself while sleeping
you need to defend yourself against me
against the whole world
i am certain i look vile
These eyes of mine are atrocious
Did i look very ugly
no you looked funny
when you are asleep in your own place you look like you are a guest
you do not look at home here at all you know
because
because you do not at all look like my kind of bird the kind i could love and could love me in return
a girl who would have your hair your nice face your body but would belong to my circles would not be a society woman
but what is it
it is nothing do not bother me
Corinne did i say something cruel
no of course not my love
what is it then
i know that i do not seem at home here
i know i seem young and yet i get into enough trouble
some are fooled but not you
and i know the reason for that too
because you and i are the same at heart
Stop talking and kiss me
no i know the reason
every morning at the same time they call me from Monte Carlo to ask about my health and find out if i have any desires i want fulfilled
you are not going to answer
if it is someone who loves you that is rotten
and if it is someone i do not love
that doesn't seem easy
i looked hard for him
he doesn't understand that i have gone out
Andr
you are superstitious
Terribly
Andr what is going to happen to me
nothing because i am here
Wait i will cancel the bad luck
a lucky charm a jinx together they will balance out fate
here i am giving it back
and you
i have got you
that is enough for me
the prodigal son has returned
yes but do not kill the fattened calf that would inconvenience you
my big mouth is not smashed in
i am sorry that your wishes weren't fulfilled
Andr
Did Victor tell you
you were talking loud enough for me to hear
you must have been happy the night before last
and if i did not go it is partly because of you
Smile then and thank me
Hey
Well then the holidays were good for you
you are looking very well
were you in the country
you are not very talkative
Perhaps you are too tired to speak
are you upset with me
you can do what you like
you are an adult my boy though certainly not a polite adult
when one leaves one says goodbye
Victor
Monsieur Victor if you do not mind
Right i am listening
nothing it is not worth it
as you like
in any case you will resume training tomorrow because i got you a preliminary for the Palais des Sports
yes and the match takes place in three weeks
so between now and then society living is out of the question save that for later if you want it
Fairly cracked eh
Right then just because you beat a bungler once doesn't mean you can think you are there
you are nothing yet understand
Plus you have already forgotten what little i taught you
can not you stop while i am talking
is it love that is knocked you for six
Right try to look like a boxer that will distract you
and wear yourself out a bit
a boxing ring's not a sitting room
what is been his problem for the past eight days
Ask to see whether there is room for me at your hotel
all right
one has to laugh to have some fun
do not trouble yourself i am going
it is true that love gives one wings
what is wrong
he wants to withdraw
Undoubtedly that is nothing new
and did he give you a reason
the reason on the telephone
that is a fine reason
Victor stay here
are you going out
yes
have you considered that the match is 15 days away
and after that
it is not because i am going out tonight
that my career is done for
Your career no but perhaps the match
this outing means a week of training is bust
you know what happens to you it happens to nearly every boxer at least once but there is a time you have to choose
and if i should choose
i speak to you as a friend
do you love her that much
do i know if i am in love
that is a line from a song it has a heap of stories around it
for me it is not so complicated
Knowing that she is somewhere in Paris that i could be with her talk to her
Just thinking of that pains me it really does
Like a punch in the face
and if i have had more passion to train it is because every day every minute i wait for her telephone call and i nearly burst
is that love
yes it looks like it
it is good is not it
because as soon as she calls me i am happy
yes but watch out young lad she will knock you out
she is way above your level
we know that but that is our personal business
mine too because this is not the time to self destruct
yeah nothing to life but boxing
for you there should be nothing else
Even against your will i will stop you from doing anything stupid hear
Listen dictators are out of style and i am fed up with being obedient
i have the right to live and go where i want
you must not be angry with me what is happening to me is so remarkable
Remarkable to the point of ruining everything
yes
all right
then listen to me and after that do what you like
i am telling you my whole life i have loved boxing but that bitch of mine never let me have it back
i was never a great boxer did you know
i only just became champion of France and with a great deal of difficulty and not even for long
Wait let me explain
i haven't been a great manager either but that is another matter that is perhaps a question of luck
before you i never got my hands on the lad that i needed then you showed up the moment i was ready to ditch everything to retire as Blanche says
and i saw immediately what you could become what i dreamed of becoming and i put all my hopes on you
and you see thanks to me you could become somebody and thanks to you i was going to succeed at something
do you remember the day i talked to you about a trade
yes i remember
so do not throw it all away like that all right
first of all for you and a little for me too
Wait my boy tonight you must go there anyways
but if i go
i have just showed you my cards but perhaps yours are higher
you should make up your mind at her side not here
since i
no no
Right now you are moved that is normal but i do not want you to one day accuse me of having manipulated you
i know it is going to be difficult but you know that in life you need to look at people and things in the face you can not always run away
so go on and take courage all the same
Victor
i can not do anything more for you Dd
in this game there comes a time when you have to play alone
Hey
you are listening at doors now
Well it is over
Victor
what
to me you were a great boxer one who did not get a lucky break
how i must have been the bane of your existence
Life was not full of laughs for you every day either was it
and then after modelling for artists i became a clothing model
then i did a bit of theatre like everyone else
then i met Chantal
she helped me elevate my position
she trained me got me started and here i am
you haven't finished
Your chap from Monte Carlo
Keep talking
Why do you want to know all that
to see your cards
my cards
yes
so your chap
Chantal introduced me to him
he has enormous amounts of money he wants to marry me
it is security a position in the world
what i have always wanted
Happiness right
how old is he
as old as that
and your Chantal gets something out of it of course
Well answer the question
her business affairs are going very poorly
i got Pierre to agree to finance the shop
he does it for me do you understand
because he detests her
since Pierre's marrying me she is at ease
you are young Andr
that is how life is
that is Paris
that kind of Paris suffocates me
but in God's name do not you wish for a bit of fresh air in the midst of that rubbish
you want to breathe do not you
yes but it is too late Andr
do not talk rubbish you are not chained up the door's right there
so say goodbye and take off
you are oversimplifying things
and anyways it is you who is complicated it and thrown everything in doubt
i was at peace
i was going to have everything i wanted and then i had to meet you
and now i need you need to feel you against me
I'd like to keep you
I'd like
i love you Andr
i love you like i have never loved before
it is marvellous
it is marvellous but it is mad because this can never lead us anywhere anywhere at all
to nothing but being happy together
i will make you forget everything it will be us two
we will never leave each other
you are so young
that makes me feel good
Say yes Corinne will you
you will see that no one would have loved you like i do
Leaving like that without even ringing you
the day's not over
if i find out anything i will come tell you
yes because we really love him
no i tell you that he did not pass by here
you are the one to ask that
if i see him yes
i am listening
yes
yes
i realise that i believe in his career
i have rarely seen anyone who started out like him
yes i understand
i am not the one who would blame you
yes got it
yes pardon me because i was not expecting that at all not in that way
Quai d'Orlans
Good got it
yes i will tell him count on me
and good luck
he is a real draught of air that kid
Everywhere he goes people catch a cold
Maria listen
I'd like you to say something to Victor for me
you do not dare to do it yourself
yes but Blanche is certain to be there and i would've rather spoken to him alone
i have been waiting for hours for her to go out
Speak kindly tell him i am grateful to him for everything that i am not a bastard that i really like him but that
but that there is someone else you love more
is that it
that is it
you are a good kid you will be happy one day too you will see
Goodbye
Maria
most of all tell him he should not resent me
Corinne
Corinne
no use shouting so loudly Monsieur she is gone
Gone
and this
Corinne answer me i know you are there
those suitcases are mine
i just came back on a hunch and found a lovely mess besides
is this a joke
Tell me it is not true
See for yourself you know the way
what is going to become of me without her
that is a question i ask myself as well
this little romance is costing me dearly
what do these idiots have to want to love at any price
i thought she was stronger than that the silly fool
Once the crisis is over she will regret it
Regret what
Come on you have got to talk to me
she hasn't gone to meet up with him has she
i knew that she could not do that to me
Did i tell you she did
then where did she go
i do not know she was not so good as to tell me
and did she leave alone
yes after making a dramatic scene she is a repressed actress do not you know
you are going to explain yourself are not you
she loved you and she left because of you
because of me
she too sacrificed to avoid undermining your future
of course there is no question of ever seeing Pierre again or me for that matter
she was going to change her life
and all this because of you
she was swimming in her tears and sappy emotions
but why
we could have been so happy
Clearly she had a different opinion
i do not believe we have anything more to say to one another
you really do not know where she is
no i give you my word
Monsieur
she begged me to return this to you
Thank you
yes
it is still me you see
how did you know the address
you are the one who spoke with her and destroyed everything
it was her idea alone
i will explain to you
she was not the one for you but all the same she is not bad
you do not need memories
you have the future come on
Come onTariq was trawling CCTV when he died looking for our laptop thief
if that is why he was killed we need to know
someone was monitoring him
Harry loves you doesn't he
i have no idea how to answer that question
i have not been running Elena
someone is posing as me
Bullshit
we know the Americans do not want this partnership to happen
ClA murder of a Russian politician on British soil
you want me to investigate a senior ClA agent
he is the one posing as me
Am i unable to free you from Harry's tentacles
Well I'd have to free myself
i do not think you have to give everything
you can have a normal life and do this
i have to believe that
she is a deniable asset for the Central Intelligence Agency
if she is working for Coaver he was not just behind the hit on Gavrik
he is responsible for stealing our intel
the ClA killed Tariq
Why should i fear
Why should i fear
when was i less by dying
Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead
Nay they live finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord
they rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah
i want you to be clear about the choices you are making
i am
we have got a mission
Shahid
you understand what that means right
yeah
Martyrdom
Peanut butter for you and Marmite for Mummy
that is Marmite
oh
Silly Mummy
Mum
i need to get going
Love you
Big kiss for you
i love you
i love you too Mummy
Thank you
Everything's ready
yes
Inshallah
what about the woman
she will be taken care of too
Quick briefing
we all know Jim Coaver ClA has been posing as me in order to mine information from Elena Gavrik
we also believe he is responsible for the attempted hit on Ilya Gavrik the theft of our intel and Tariq's death
Why would he do it
the US would love our partnership with the Russians to fail
Overt diplomatic pressure would get messy
Better a black op to destabilise the process send the Russians packing and have us running back into the American's arms
i am highly agnostic about this deal with the Russians anyway but if the ClA think they can kick us around like some banana republic they have another thing coming
what can we do
we are going to need hard proof
we need incontrovertible evidence before we take it upstairs
Ruth is planning how we will get it
the rest of you business as usual
i just wanted you to know what we are up against
so it is the five of us against the ClA
Well all for one and one for all
Zubeir al Saad
he is been radicalising inmates at Eastland prison since he was first put there for inciting hatred against non Muslims
been converting young men by the score
Preparing the most capable for Jihad
if my antennae are functioning correctly
i detect a vague hint of criticism of prisons policy
a literal captive audience of marginalised vulnerable young men
we have put him in a cage with 900 of them
his very own finishing school for extremists
i know i know
but what can we do
Let him go free
if i overturned his conviction he'd be out there ranting on the streets
a gift to the far right
a PR nightmare with the Muslim world
it is a no win
i get rather a lot of those
as for our intelligence sharing talks with the Russians
later this morning let's make this one a tad less sharey eh
Lost visual
Thought we'd lost you
High security prison hasn't exactly helped my paranoia
i had to make sure i was not being followed
what have you got for us
my daughter have you
we are still working on getting her over here Ashur
i have been in Eastland for two years
and these things take time
i need to know she is safe
Safe here that was the deal
Nothing's changed
Help us and we get your daughter
we have people looking out for her
she is safe
you have no idea what these people are capable of do you
i know these people i lived alongside them
they have one purpose
Killing
they think they love God but they only love death
that is why we need you to tell us what is going on
we were told to prepare for Shahid
so an attack is going ahead
we are to be martyrs
we are to blow ourselves up
but not for Allah
for al Saad
it won't come to that
if you are in any danger we will pull you immediately
we need details Ashur
i do not have any
we are waiting to hear from our handler with instructions
he is due to call at midday
what is his name
OK we need to find out who it is who is running this operation from the outside
Once we have that we can get you out of there
Ashur this pen contains a hidden transmitter
if there is any problems we will know
it is also a tracking device
we will be moments away
this will be over very soon
then you will be reunited with your daughter
i promise
Ashur
Thank you
a face we are all familiar with
Zubeir al Saad
UK citizen
Trained in Al Farouq in Afghanistan
Spent some time in Chechnya where he started training suicide bombers
then tried to set up a franchise at Hale End mosque
Shares al Qaeda's ideology
Apparently he was incensed by Bin Laden's death
Like thousands of others with al Qaeda membership
now he also has a personal grudge because we have refused his request for a second appeal
we have confirmation that he plans to use former prisoners to carry out an attack in London
we have identified one prisoner
we have watched Mani Jones for a while
Linked to the BNP in the past but converted to Islam two years ago
he was radicalised in Eastland by Saad and has been primed for martyrdom
he was released today
he is holed up in a flat with our asset Ashur Mohali
Ashur Mohali was picked up just over two years ago working illegally in London
we discovered he was a university lecturer in Pakistan who unfortunately for him was related to a senior member of al Qaeda
an association that is made him a very useful asset
the deal was he'd be our eyes and ears in Eastland and in return we'd give him residency and get his daughter out of Pakistan
he was also released this morning and warned us that an attack was imminent
what details do we have
Ashur and Mani expect a call from their handler at midday
which indicates it will take place sometime today
if it is scheduled for today then someone out there has explosives presumably the handler
we are monitoring all Ashur and Mani's known associate
Keep looking into candidates for our handler
Calum and i will take over surveillance on the flat
Bit counter productive giving al Saad his own taxpayer funded training camp
Why what would you do genius
3 of the UK's population is Muslim
in our prisons it is 11
I'd take a look at that first
Ruth how are we progressing with Mohali's daughter
Harry's talking to the Home Office
they are being typically difficult
Red tape
Maybe a direct appeal to the Home Secretary
me
He'd be more responsive if you speak to him
Maybe
for once I'd like to fulfil the promises we have made to someone who is risking their life for us
Sorry man
it is OK
that your daughter
she is cute as
can i see
that is cool
she looks happy
her sixth birthday
my brother used to smile like that too
Big wide open mouth like a clown at a funfair
she means everything to me
yeah i bet
Your family know you are out
Tried to call my little bro before we left but he hung up on me
my mum doesn't like him speaking with me
she is kind of brainwashed him
they do not want me in their life
what can you do
Just the way it is
when it comes down to it you will be sure why you are doing it then
i er
Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead
' Nay they live
' finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord'
they rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah
Paradise man that is why i am doing it
all them virgins
Anything's got to be better than this bullshit right
so what was you inside for
they suspected me of being al Qaeda
no shit
that is cool man
' how comes you never told me you were such a gangster before'
have you asked the Home Secretary about Mohali's daughter yet
not today no
Maybe i can push him after our meeting
Erin's quite insistent
and rightfully so i think
Maybe i could have a word
as you wish
i think i have figured out a way to get the proof against Jim Coaver
Tell me it is clean and simple
We'd need Elena
and Sasha too
Ruth
Am i not seeing you and Harry with our Russian friends shortly
yes
i just wanted a word in private first
Well the preparations for your transfer are all set this end
Actually this is not about your offer
i haven't had a chance to tell him yet
oh
Well in your own time
i wanted to speak to you about Ashur Mohali our asset inside the al Saad operation
it is about his daughter we are trying to get her resident status
Well the paperwork seems to have been forgotten in someone's in tray while he is risking his life for us
we will see how this thing pans out
that was not the agreement
he is been our asset for two years
if it is a positive outcome i will finish the paperwork
that is politics Ruth
you will learn quickly
it is a complex game
shall we
so exactly how do you start sharing a lifetimes' secrets
you go first
Gentlemen we are gathered here in the spirit of a forward looking alliance
Let's leave our misgivings and uncharitable preconceptions back in the'80s shall we
you are right Home Secretary
if we want this friendship to succeed
and we all do
we must put the past behind us and see how we can assist each other now and in the future
but first i have a question
do the Americans know we are discussing intelligence sharing
no
Contrary to common perception we do manage our own affairs
Why do you ask Ilya
i can not imagine they'd be pleased
Let's not worry about Uncle Sam
he is too busy pondering over the trillions he owes the Chinese
of course
so let's talk
who do the FSB think killed JFK
the ClA and the Mafia
i thought everyone knew that
Patience
yeah think i got bored waiting in line when God was dishing that out
you know
Shahid
it doesn't necessarily have to mean martyrdom
they have stopped praying
' the Prophet says himself i would love to be martyred
' in Allah's Cause'
what the hell's he doing
Trying to talk him out of it
that is not his job
Maybe he thinks it is
' he said that at a time of war the Prophet had to fight'
but as soon as he felt his people were safe he devoted his attention to spreading peace
Mani killing violates some of the Holy Book's most sacred precepts
the Koran states that it is far more meritorious
' to forgo revenge in a spirit of charity'
Careful Ashur' than to slay your enemy'
but Jihad
Muhammad tells his companions as they return home after a battle
we are returning from the lesser Jihad
to the greater Jihad
the far more urgent and momentous task of removing wrongdoing from one's own heart
i am hungry
we have common threats
it is clear we can benefit by cooperating as we move forward
the question is do we want to go back
Share archives
Come on Ilya we'd be wading through skeletons for years to come
Excuse me i have to take this
Unless you'd like me to pop it on speakerphone
no that won't be necessary
for now
Well perhaps we should leave it there
i do think it is been very productive indeed
my mother's driver is picking her up from Regent Street in half an hour so make this quick
we are a little pushed for time ourselves
we need your help with Jim Coaver
i thought you were taking care of that
the ClA want to destroy the partnership between our two countries before it is even signed they are even prepared to kill
this is an attack on both our nations
what would you need from us
is Jim Coaver still contacting you as Harry
yes
there was another message last week
Good
he thinks his cover's intact
Reply saying you have realised someone's trying to stop the deal that they have killed agents on both sides
Tell him you know who it is you are frightened and you want to meet
Why
Jim Coaver will think that you are trying to tell Harry that he is behind the attacks
he will want to kill her
Thus proving his guilt
which is why we'd like you there Sasha to protect your mother
no
i won't let you use her as bait
Sasha this is not your decision
as you say he is working against all of us
i will send the message
we have to go
Dimitri
a small time arms dealer on our radar just got picked up
he is admitted to selling RDX high explosive to a friend of al Saad's
' a former inmate from Eastland'
he must be the handler
Tell Erin now
got a car approaching
Diplomatic plates
459 Delta 863
Running through the DVLA database
they are unregistered
is it him
is it Coaver
can not tell
it is too far away
Shit
there is a woman approaching the car
it is the woman from the reception
she is leaving
Wait wait wait
he is moving off
Steady Sasha
we have to let him show his hand
Ruth can you see him
no
Negative ID
he is leaving
are you all right
i am fine
Sasha
Coaver sent her to kill you
oh he is getting a phone call
this could be it
Come on Ashur do not let me down
hello
yes
OK
30 minutes
we are meeting them outside
half an hour
you OK
you know you do not have to do this
i understand you have got your daughter
you do not have to either
this is what i have got
for the first time i feel like there is some
i do not know some higher purpose
Things make sense you know
i am going to get clean
he is ditching the transmitter
he is running
we need to get him to meet the handler
it might be our only chance of finding the target
i am going after him
i was not running you know
i just wanted to feel the sun on my face
Feel what freedom is like
it is been a long time
the boy
Mani
it breaks my heart kids like that
they are always kids like that
they are fed so many lies about Islam
they mistake the attention they get from the likes of al Saad as some kind of fatherly love
they think Shahid gives them a purpose
he has a good heart
he doesn't deserve to die
he won't but we need you to stay with us
or it will just be another kid who al Saad gets to
i fear what is going to happen
no matter what i do i keep coming back to this same place getting caught up in this same
lunacy
Maybe it is my destiny
Maybe i just can not escape it
Hold on Ashur
Wait for the handler
Nobody's going to die today
' Erin you'd better get him back quick before Mani notices he is gone'
that is better
i feel re charged
Ready to roll
the minders are here
Report
they are on the move
they are off to meet their handler
Alpha two i need you here
i am on my way
you are my ears
they are going on cleaning routes
they could be onto us
Something's up with Ashur's feed
it is not the pen
they must have some kind of scrambler
they have just gone into a yard under the arches
Ashur's signal's being scrambled
Belt and braces
they will be getting the details of the attack
Eastland is crawling with spies
for all i know you are spies too
this woman was seen arriving three times in the last year
she is Ml5
i can not trust you
the plan's changed
my daughter
this has nothing to do with our families man
the Koran states
the killing of bystanders is religiously justified in Jihad
the prophet says Go forward in the name of Allah
do not kill an elderly person a small child a woman
Al Saad would never have agreed to this
there was no way we were going to back out
and we ain't spies neither
we are carrying out God's work
i will not allow anything to undermine this operation
do you understand
Complete this mission or his daughter will die
do we pull them now
no we hold back
Suicide bombers usually detonate within three hours of meeting their handlers
we need to keep him in
we need the explosives or they can switch bombers and go ahead with the attack
Ashur and Mani are not going to be privy to that information
the handler i presume
it is got to be
they are splitting up
Stay with Ashur and Mani
i will take the handler
Receiving Alpha Five's images
Let's see if he is on Facebook
he is heading into the station
Keep your distance
Calum what have you got
Anthony Rashaida
UK citizen
Parents Sudanese immigrants
Trained in Al Farouq
' Thought to be involved in several recent suicide bombings in Karachi'
we weren't watching him
Hasn't been seen here since 2000
he must have snuck in under the radar
Alpha one looks like they are heading back to the flat
Let's see where Mr Rashaida takes us
Shit i have lost him
got him
i think he is seen me
Turning left into Melwood Lane
' Erin
are you OK'
i am fine
Redflash from Six in Karachi
Ashur's daughter's been kidnapped
what
they were supposed to be watching her
they are getting into a car
i am not sure they are returning to the flat
they are going the wrong way
Targets are not going to the flat
i am tracking the car through the pen transmitter
i have lost the signal
Alpha one i am not sure Ashur Mohali's still with us
Anthony Rashaida the handler disappeared on London Wall Street
Ashur Mohali our agent we think he is been compromised
his daughter's kidnapped maybe leverage for him to complete the mission
they swapped cars in a multi storey car park
i am still trying to trace them
the face recog's rolling on CCTV but we are coming up with nothing
do everything you can
we are running out of options
the attack could happen at any minute
where are these people
so what is it with you guys and this hanging out by the river
now i know you have been looking into me Ruth
Way back too
and i want to know why
Shit
it was a favour to Harry
what the hell does he think i am up to
Arming Cornish separatists
he is been betrayed too many times
he is he is seeing enemies everywhere
he begged me to look into you
and all i found out was that you two were friends
you trusted each other
i felt sorry for him
you are the one person he could always rely on and now
i am just another monster under the bed huh
yeah
i have seen that happen to a lot of good people
but i would not call the men in white coats just yet
Berlin was not all wine and roses
do you see the file on Treptower Park
there was no file on what happened in Treptower Park
but Harry told me
i would never have done it
i hope he knows that
i do not shoot my friends
Family maybe but not my friends
i do not know what he told you but he was out of control
Attempting to extract a top level asset without a shred of authorisation
a KGB officer's wife for Christ's sake
he was endangering multiple operations
and all because he'd knocked up Elena and felt bad about it
i had to stop him
you were doing him a favour
he did not see it like that then
so stop digging up my backyard Ruth
i thought the Brits were meant to be more polite
Ruth
Harry
i have the proof you need
it is him
hello
it is me
Listen do not hang up
where is Mum
is she there
a call to Mani Jones's brother's phone
Unknown number
Find the location of that call
Just listen to me
Please please just do not hang up yeah
this is important
i am triangulating position
got the location
Kenlow Rise Forest Gate
Get Erin and Dimitri there
no more chances we hit them now
you called someone did not you
who were you talking to
Ashur
Get down here now
Believe me i never called anyone
what is going on
they have been onto us from the very beginning
Following our every move
you have been tailed from the moment you left prison
which one of you is Ml5
i know one of you is
Security services
no
Get a move on if you want your daughter to live
Go
now
Mani's been shot
i need an ambulance immediately
Mani
Mani i need you to help us
you are going to be all right
i am sorry Mum
OK now look at me
Just stay with me
Run
Alpha two you OK
they got away
Ashur took me out
Please please help him
Ash
Ashur
his little daughter
Control where the hell is that ambulance
two minutes away
Did they tell you where the attack will happen
Please come on come on look at me focus on my face
you will be fine
Did they tell you where
Mani stay with me
Mani where were they taking you
Sq squ square
what square
what square
Look at me what square
Mani stay with me
what square
Pulling up every camera on the square
Still no sign of Ashur
Hang on
there he is
he is on the southeast side of the square
Heading to the north terrace
Ashur
Ashur
Please
they got her
my daughter
i am sorry
you said you would protect her
you promised
for two years you promised
i know
and we are still doing everything we can
i am a peaceful man not a violent one
but now i must die to save my daughter
Control the bomb is chained to him
it is enough explosive for a 50 metre kill radius
how long before we have an explosives team onsite
Six minutes
Looks like he is got a remote detonator as well as a timer
i can not let this happen Ashur
Like me you have no choice
we are in the same position
Neither of us have a choice now
Control they have got Erin's daughter
you must dial that number
Intercept it
who is this
where is my daughter
Your daughter's safe for now
Attempting to intercept the call
if you attempt to disarm the bomb your daughter dies
got it
if you attempt to evacuate the area your daughter dies
and if you yourself leave the area she dies
as punishment for recent actions of the British Government
Trafalgar Square will be attacked at 6pm
and Ml5 will allow it to happen
the call was routed through several exchanges but i think i can run a trace
Come on come on come on
Bingo
Alpha two we have got an address for the handler
i am on my way
Dimitri's two kilometres from target
i need an update
Give me an update
CO 19 are entering the square
no Harry please do not
i promised Ashur
i am sorry Erin
but we have no time to spare
Dimitri will get her i know he will
' Strike team taking up position'
Ashur's making his way to Nelson's Column
' he is panicking'
Dimitri can you make it in time
Let me try
Dimitri's 200 metres from the target
' Strike team in position'
Strike team in place
Dimitri's at the target address
Alpha two
Report
' Going in'
' Target identified
' Permission to fire
' Please wait Harry'
Harry
' do we have permission to fire'
Proceed
' Alpha two
' Update
' Device disabled'
Alpha two
' Dimitri'
Target down
i have got Rosie
she is safe
you must be Rosie
Rosie
Come on let's get you inside huh
Clever girl
D
you should get some rest
the Home Office have granted
Ashur Mohali's daughter permanent residency
her uncle and aunt are going to take her
that is good
we need you Erin
we do
we need people like you
People with humanity
i can not do it Harry
Try and remember the reasons you wanted to do this job in the first place
i fear that is the only chance i will have of keeping you
how you doing
how is Rosie
she is fine
i told her it was all just a game
Up until now she is the only person i have never lied to
Come on you lie to her all the time
Father Christmas
Tooth Fairy the Easter Bunny
you can always tell her what really happened when she is older
so if Rosie's the only person you have never lied to that means you lied to me
got to keep you on your toes
Elena Sasha
would i have ever found out about them if they hadn't come back into your life
do you know what it is like to feel something for someone and then one day realise you do not even know them
you do know me
you know all the important things
you stupid man
People do not love each other on a need to know basis Harry
i am not sure that is always true
i think to myself maybe this is the final thing his last secret
but then i look at you and i realise there are so many more
are not there
yes
the Home Secretary has asked me to join his staff
Advising him directly on intelligence and security matters
what did you say
i said i needed to talk to you first
i won't go if you say you can not afford to lose me
Tell me to stay and i will
i think you should go
i can not afford to lose you but Towers is right
you could be so much more
and i have been selfish
i should have urged you to move on years ago
i will stay until this is over
Until the partnership is signed or not
no
Go as soon as you can
Why
i do not want you involved in what is coming
you pulled me out of a meeting with Belgians for this
so let's make it long my friend
Friends do not last long in our business Jim
if they do not die on you they turn against you
Somehow you and i seem to have managed to hang on
Almost makes you suspicious doesn't it
that was supposed to be a joke
i will give you 24 hours Jim to search your conscience
Come clean and do the right thing
you are shaking the wrong tree
i do not know what you are talking about
Maybe you should tell me what i have done
Elena yesterday
Tariq Masood
were you ordered to take the life of my officer when he found out what you were doing or was it a spur of the moment improvisation
what
i have stood by bad decisions of yours in the past Harry
and suffered for them
Please do not make another one
24 hours Jim
and i am coming after you
Coming after me
Harry you forget who i work for
then i suppose i will have to come after them too
you Brits
who do you think formulates ClA policy
Scooby Doo
i do not know who to trust any more including me
i am going to stand down after this
i am going to resign my commission
i am sorry
i could have done so much more
you want to steal evidence from the American Embassy
do we have authorisation for this
we assumed it would be futile
Harry we have got a problem
that decides it
we take Jim Coaver
has he gone completely stark staring mad
Ruth you are my adviser
Advise me

Evil
Come on Mal we must leave
N
Others
Evil
N
to go anywhere
for God's sake
i am 16 years old Luke
Like you
Luke v if you want
Seriously dude
V soon
not yet
it is too late
he wanted to kill me i
would have killed me i n is it were by Luke
if n
it were for him
he would do the same for me
and i come you know
and my friend
my best friendRamn
Ramn
Ramn
what have they done to you
Father
Holy Mother of God
Look how they messed up my son
Stay calm Ramn
you will recover in no time
all we can do now is to ask Barrett for more time
he will never listen to us
Believe me son it is worth a try
i wonder why Barrett is so interested in taking our land away from us
Why did he give us the money
Being nice
no
Barrett is after our land
he owns 8 000 animals he has to feed every day
they already cleared out many settlers
by now they own the property
when mother and i arrived here there was nobody living'round this place
the two us worked hard with our bare hands in the fields
for two years we ate nothing but turnips
the land appeared to be dead
a dried out godforsaken dusty stony desert
during the wintertime too frozen to get a nail into the ground
Dried out during the summertime not a single worm lived in the ground
but after two years the land awakened
Green grass appeared when the snow melted
then came the rain and the grain started to grow
then you were born
Your mother died on this land
she cared for it to the very last minute
and the two of us buried her here on this land
you remember do not you Ramn
Nobody will run me off this place
and those who will try i am gonna kill
Go and see Barrett Ramn
Tell him we are gonna pay him
we are honest folks
Ramn
Tell him we are gonna pay him
we are decent people
Let's learn those bastards a lesson
Mount up and come on
i won't Steven
i do not like that kind of game
what is your choice
you want them going on burning down our houses
we won't gain anything burning theirs
the law will protect us
Did you hear that
the law
the sheriff could not care less
we have to take the law in our own hands or they will run us off our land
that is right Ramn
we have to find justice for us
Justice this ain't
it is revenge you want
Go ahead
but leave me out of this
what if they had burned down your house instead of Kenneths place
what if they had killed your wife
they did not kill anybody
they beat them up and burned the crop
Go tell the sheriff
after all it is his job
you are one lousy bastard
a coward
Just a dirty Mexican
Leave him alone Mick
we do not need people like him
Just pray they won't be after you next time
if they burn your house do not come and see us about it
Just remember that you asked for it
you did fine my son
Revenge is too easy and unnecessary
what will be left is a bitter taste like eating a green fruit
but you know that already do not you Ramn
Stick' em up
Hurry up bastards
Hurry up
Burn the house down
Hurry up
Burt
this man wants to see Mister Barrett
i have to talk to Mister Barrett
where can i find him
Hey did you see him
here is Ramn
Why would Mister Barrett talk to you
i am supposed to bring the mortgage
do you have the money
Well to be honest
i had the money
i wanted to tell him that but
he took it away from me
i recognize him
i was attacked and Mister Barrett's money was stolen
what are you talking about Bastard
it was him
i was robbed i swear to God
it was four of them
Did you ever saw this panhandler before
not that i recall Boss
Lots of panhandlers around this area here
Sure but but this one here calls you a thief
Let him go and let him repeat what he just said
i will you are a lousy thief
what is going on Slim
what is wrong with you
Beating up a guy in my house
this man says Slim stole money from him that he was going to bring to you
that is right
Ramn i was expecting you
is that story true
who robbed you
he and three others robbed me while i was on my way to bring you the money
is he right
is it true
he is a dirty lyer
i saw him
i tore his mask down his face
can you prove what you say
no i was all alone
i can assure you i am not wrong about this
it WAS him
that is a serious accusation
if you can not prove it you are in serious trouble
Believe me i was on my way to bring you the money
i think he has no money to pay you
that is why he came up with that story
now i have no money left to pay you but i am asking you to give me more time
you should have ask me without calling my men thieves
Explain to him that he was wrong
i will get it into his head
now Ramn are you still believing it was me who robbed you
yes you are a thief
what are you saying
i can not hear you
Speak up tell my friends too
you are a bunch of thieves
we are wasting time here
i want to see you becoming a gentleman
do not tell any lies
now try to remember
the guy who robbed you how did he look like
he had the face of a thief just like yours
you better admit you made up this story so you do not have to pay the mortgage
i did not you thief
when did you came up with that idea i had robbed you
you claim to know better where i was and what happened
you never saw me there ain't that so Ramn
you stole the money
Hurry up guys come here
what happened
Talk
Steven burned down the house at Paso Bolt
Move on saddle the horses and wait for me
the settlers burned down the camp at Paso Bolt
we are wasting time Barrett
we have to give them hell
if you'd let me go ahead
Seems you always do what you want
who burned down Kenneth's Ranch
it was necessary
they would not let pass through our cattle
and they polluted the water
i do not like that kind of action
by now you should know that
i do not care what you like
you can put on your gentleman act as much as you want but do not forget that we are equal partners
do not worry i won't forget
but do not come complaining once the settlers start burning down our camps
i do not want to start a war with the settlers Burt
i just want the land that is all
i prefer to get it by any means legal
Legal
you will spend years trying to get rid of them adopting lawful means
Why are you in such a hurry Burt
Steven is gathering all the settlers around him
and once they are united
i will take care of Steven
you know certain matters take a lot of thinking and quietness
i am tired of being quiet
while we wait they might start using barbwire
they will start giving you hell
Enough now Burt
you take care of the cattle i will take care of the rest
do not talk to me that way
you think you are smarter than i am
you treat me like a bully because i do not take my hat off in front of women the way you do it
do not forget i know you as well as the smell of my own feet
i could lock you up in jail while burping in the sheriffs face
Let's go and thank those bastards
Anybody with a weak stomach now is the time to tell
Well hello Rezza
did not see you for a while
I'd say so
you still charge that much
Even more
Right
Actually that is why i am hiring you
Good work has its price
we will see Mister Barrett
what are we talking about
what is this all about
Burt
you are short 1 000 Dollars
Take this for a start
in one month you will get another 10 000
when did you become a benefactor
who do you want to kill
the governor
someone more important
he is worth 10 000 Dollars
Dead even more you can count on that
Maybe it is none of my business but why in a month and not now
a bit of time will calm the waves first
by then the farmers will stop acting like defenders
in the meantime they will run further into dept
at the right moment i will go after them
you are 1 000 Dollars short Senor
i won't work for less
Alright Rezza
but do not forget to be secretive about it
the man will die at his own hands
the two of us have a deal then
i will expect you in one month
but i warn you it is going to be a difficult job
i will keep in shape Senor
besides a month passes by so quickly
and do not forget
i am the one around here who gives the orders
those you give to me cost a fortune
you better not waste them
Seven seems to be your lucky day
that is the fifth time you got seven
are you saying that i am cheating
no i do not
Heaven forbid
i would never dare to say so
then i guess i heared wrongly
Go ahead bet your money
who is holding the bank
Nobody's holding the bank
it is a town of starving people
this place should get rid of the pigs that pollute it
you could start by hanging yourself Burt
when talking about pigs you were talking about yourself right
Stop it or i will call the sheriff
Get out to settle your affair
Out of my way Lady
you think you can scare me off with your lady manners
Stop it Burt
you drank too much
i will go and tell Barrett
Go to hell
you and Barrett that quitter
i do as i please
i am not his mistress
you dirty whore
you are gonna pay for that
Watch out Burt
the boss doesn't like that kind of talk when it comes to his broad
Barett Barrett Barrett
Barrett is trash just like her
so you left Ramn to become a lady
but you always stayed a whore
what is going on
who fired his gun
Seems like no one wants to talk
the next time i am gonna arrest all of you
Rum
Seven
Hey
Hey where do you think you are going
i won't continue with this game
Rum
no easy way out
i am losing
but you are winning 500 Dollars
my friend says he is losing so he is losing
i am the one who is behind
what kind of gentleman would leave the table while winning
no more games my friend bet your money
do not think about it
Hold the bank it might pay off
Go on bet your money
will you hurry up
Put on Banco
Banco
not you my friend
not you i said
you heard him
Thanks
Banco
Banco
Seven
you are a cheat
you hear me
you are cheating
my name is Rezza
i acted in self defense
if you want to tell it everybody
Slim
you thief
Murderer
is he hurt
there is a bullet in his shoulder
you know him yes
Take him away i beg you
he is Mexican they will blame him
i beg you for it
for the first time in my life i have to thank somebody and i do it with pleasure
do not worry i will return him once he has recovered
what happened
Archangel Gabriel came along
and disappeared again
there is a bullet in your shoulder
Try not to move
i will try to get it out but it won't be easy
Take it
Drink it it is coffee
as you wish
what is your name
you lost your voice
you still had it when you tried to kill that man
Listen to me Chico
Shoot first and then talk
Nobody listens to that crap anyway
so it is better not to talk at all
are you afraid
Let's see whether you really lost your breath
Drink Chico
so you still have a voice
Hey Chico it is thougher to get it out than to get it in
at least for me it is
Drink
in a few days you are free to go wherever you want to go to
the girl is waiting for you
Hey Chico you still think of that girl
what is her name
i do not know
she is very pretty
i bet a lot of bastards are chasing her around
i used to know one like her too
for a dollar she'd spend a night with you
she had a boyfriend
a Mexican just like you
this guy was really tight lipped
Believe me Chico the boy really was in love with her
he even promised her to marry her someday for what you need her just give her a Dollar some said Why would you marry her
Whenever she took some guy to bed with her he took his rifle and shouted he was going to kill them
in the end he married her
when he was away to work she brought in men and paid them
one Dollar to be specific
Enough now
Hey Chico what is the matter
Go to sleep and forget about it
Women are all alike anyway
what are you doing
are you leaving
that is fine
we are even now
you have a nice trip Chico
Hey Chico
where are you going anyway
Why do not you stay a while
there is still time to go away
but do not act like a mummy
if i stay i want to learn from you
what do want to learn
how to shoot
do not wait until you are running out of bullets before you reload
Fire off five shots and then reload
so there is always one left in the chamber
Stand tall
Just like that
first stretch your arm then we will go on
Go
Too low
Too high
now
no not like that
you have to do it with the first shot Chico
there is no risk shooting at bottles
but facing a man armed with a gun you either kill him or he might kill you
Hit him with your first shot or it will be too late Chico
i would never have guessed that you can play
i used to play a lot
the place i grew up there was an old man
each day at dawn i saw him play on the street
where were you born
down south
Walk towards the sun and sooner or later you will get there
Why do not you go back there
i will return
i hardly can wait
two more weeks and i am on my way
Why not now
there is something left to do
an important job maybe the last one
what kind of job
None of your business Chico
Actually it is not even my business
i only know i get paid well
i wanna take the money go home and see whether the old man still lives playing music at dawn
Margaret come here
Sit down
you want a sip
that is enough now
you are some kind of guy
how come Mister Barrett is not here yet
Relax Paquito
Barrett is always on time
you never know when he comes but he always comes
any more words and i will fire you
hello
an interesting table
may i join you
we are playing low stakes
Very well
this place surely changed since poor Burt left it for good
it became less amusing
Nobody misses him Mister Barrett
you probably the least of all
he was a true friend
a son of a bitch
Whatever
i am sure now everything will fall into places
we have to work together and change this land into a paradise
you said that before
i just discovered my love for this land my dear
no matter what it produces
i am just a simple man
i have to talk to you
Please excuse us
Just a moment gentlemen
a common thief
the land that he loves belongs to others
first and final commandment
do not steal your neighbors land but die on your own
Amuse yourself
what is the big joke
I'd like to see you
you will never see me like that Chico
what do you think you got holding a gun in your hand
a weapon
no Chico
Just an excuse to get killed
a gun means nothing unless you can use it
but i am learning
how to shoot but that is not enough
this here is you and that is your opponent
you are facing each other equal rivals
each one carries a gun each loaded with six bullets
you are all ready to shoot
but one of you is in a better position the one with the sun behind his back
first with the sun behind your back your opponent stands in full light
second that way your opponent has difficulties seeing you that well
Watch your shadow Chico
if you see it in front of you you can draw
if you do not see your shadow wait
Move slowly until you see it
while you are moving wet your lips
Wet them all around
if it feels cold on the right side the wind is coming from that direction
if it is cold in the middle the wind is blowing right into your direction
Facing the wind is bad
it will slow down your shot
it is better to have the wind in your back
it won't affect you then
what if it blows from the side
you have to learn to judge its strength
if you see dust the wind is deep and strong
if the leaves in the trees move the wind is high up and blowing less hard
how do you judge the wind
i feel it in my hairs Chico
that is why i wear them long
it is all instinct like being an animal
Forget that you are a human being
you have to feel like an animal facing another animal
Your whole body must be dedicated to kill
Your skin your breath your eyes
everything can help you getting some kind of advantage
how come you know these things
i understand and learned them Chico
when you are facing death you feel like an animal
nothing but an animal
if you refuse to become one you might not survive
Did you ever see a mountain lion
if he is hungry he will slowly walk around
then he suddenly stops stretches out his snout and waits
he doesn't move just stands still
Why
he smells the wind
as soon as he feels it he stops in his tracks and the wind supplies him with all kind of smells
Once he likes a smell he jumps and stays leeward
that way his victim smells him too late when he is already on it
Remember in a duel of life and death the winner is the one with more will to live
and the living usually are more hungry than the dead
you do not eat before a duel
no i just shave
if someone faces death and he bothers to shave you can be damn sure he rather wants to live than to die
Just like you
yes
i am not like you
my life is not that important to me
this too could be an advantage
you could become an excellent killer
some sort of killing machine
you could make a lot of money
i am not interested in money
Chico this girl she'd appreciate you staying alive much more than being dead right
no
you are so right
it is impossible to understand women
they are like walls you never know what is on the other side
there is a barrier you will you never break down once you killed someone
what is that
Society
they will build up a high wall in front of you they will respect you
they will fear you but never love you
you will always stay on one side of that wall
Better that way
that is what i used to think
then one day you realise life is on the other side of that wall and you are no part of it
Ever
i think you are getting old
Maybe
i am tired of this life
you are always alone like a dog and you are waiting to die like a dog only more miserably
you are the only friend i ever met Chico
Probably because i never wanted any friends before
are you sure i am your friend
Sure and you can be sure i am yours
so take care you said you still have a job to do
do it first and then think of the rest
you taught me that
you are right Chico
Work comes first
you know Chico friendship is one of those things you leave behind at the other side of that wall
for ever
Remember that once you killed somebody for the very first time
i am gonna tear you to pieces
he is letting you have it
Why do not you give it a try
Order is order
Enough now
Stop it i said
what the hell is the matter with you
Enough now
he attacked one of my men who was unarmed
are you crazy
he attacked me from behind
he was still not armed and you are carrying a gun
my men had enough of those provocations
Listen sheriff i can not calm them down anymore by now
Maybe i should put you all in jail and call the federal judge
do not tell any jokes sheriff
if someone has to be locked up it is Steven
he attacks my men as soon as they are unarmed
do not expect to get rid of me that way Barrett
i respected the cease fire
but from now on my men will be heavily armed
you want a war on your hands you got it
Dirty bastards
Let it be Steven
for now i will lock you up to calm you down
then we will see
Alright Chico
you aim well
you are sure to go ahead
i proved that did not i
Well
so you do not mind facing me in a duel
you still want to test me
no Chico
a duel
for real
if you can kill me it will mean you are ready
no i won't do that
i might really kill you
are you accepting or are you a coward
no
a real duel Chico
Try to kill me if you can
so your life is not important to you
you are afraid to die that is it
Once you are dead that girl will find 100 men better than you are
do not worry
then do it for her give her the chance to improve herself
you asked for it
if i succeed i am gonna kill you
that is the way i like you boy
we are equal opponents
so it is either me or you
Hey here i am
Go ahead kill me
you felt secure you needed a cold shower
if you can count up to'six' you can save yourself
otherwise you have had it
Remember that son
it is called math Chico
you have to count
all the time
Count the steps count the shots
Yours and those of your opponent
Count Chico always count
Count the minutes
no one can hold a pistol for longer than three minutes without starting to tremble
Once you start trembling you are the loser
Count Chico always count
if your opponent makes a step and then stops he is afraid
if he makes two steps he is uneasy
if makes three steps he is about to kill you
Why this cross
if this bullet hits you it will have the impact of a canonball
if such a bullet hits its target you can not go wrong
what is your job
who has to die
i do not know yet i do not know him
Tomorrow will be my last day as a warrior
then i am gonna change my life
how
i told you Chico
i will go back to where i came from
Settling down raising a family
a wife maybe
if that old man is still there playing music at dawn i am gonna invite him to my house and give him food and drinks
he may lie down on a bed
and i will say to him
you walked a long way old man
now it is time to rest
i saw you walking around since i was a little boy
he must have rested along the way
i only saw him walking around
as far as i am concerned that old man never stopped walking
that old man is you
and now your mind is set on climbing that wall you talked about
Maybe
do not think too much about it
i was only joking
how come you never asked me why i wanted to learn how to shoot
because i knew it
you are out to kill someone
yes but who
do not you want to know
Maybe yourself
the old Chico you once was
i saw many people die it doesn't affect me any longer
i am sorry i am leaving you behind
you will be in a lot of touble
i am sure
do not worry about me
i know what i am doing
i am sorry i can not support you
one thing i can do for you
Take this
you will find everything
a razor a brush and a mirror
Thank you
Shave my son
Remember who bothers to shave rather wants to live than to die
Chico
Practice practice all the time
Getting better will cheer you up
if you miss you will never know what you are missing anyway
Good luck
but
Hey
so you missed it too
who can tell my boy
Life is an illusion
the important thing is to believe that you can make it
Farewell
Ramn was here
Ramn was here
and who is Ramn
you forgot about him
but he remembered you
he came back here because of you
he wants to kill you
Kill me
but why
you better ask him
he said he has time
that he waited for so long a day more or less won't make a difference
what are you talking about
Come on tell me what you know
Seems that you strechted things with this boy Barrett
there is only one thing left for you
Kill him
Maybe you'd do him a favour with that
Unless he kills you
he might gain a greater pleasure from that
Thank Barrett i let you go he asked me for it
he promised he'd do his best to avoid further incidents
i can not believe what i hear Sheriff
you all believe that Barrett is an angel
be prepared for a big surprise
Come on Steven he is no devil
he is a devil
as long as i am here the settlers will keep their land
it would be better if you would not help this bastard
Ramn
may God forgive him
1 000 Dollars for the man who will bring me the murderer
Hey Ramn
Barrett said you wanted to talk to him
with Barrett not with his bootlickers
Talk about what
that sort of talk
you are early Senor
how much will you charge me for a favour
another one
you intend to move up Armageddon
no
no jokes
this is serious business
how much do you want
nothing my work is done
Your last job i promise
no way
in the end i kill the whole village with only you and me left
i am telling you this is the last job
i will give you another 10 000 Dollars
15 000
Alright 20 000
who is the guy
his name is Ramn
you will find him in a burned down house near the village
you can not miss it
i bet you burned it down
so you accept
Agreed
Payment in advance
Very well tonight i will bring you the money
you will find me here
who bothers to shave rather wants to live than to die
Ramn
Did Barrett send you
it is him you wanted to kill right
None of your business
Go away Rezza
i am a professional Ramn
Once i got paid i will go all the way
Why do you want to kill Barrett
you said it yourself once
by killing him i kill what i once was
you can have my horse
Take it and leave this place forever
if you hate somebody the world is not big enough
you will forget very soon you will see
you wanted to go back to the place you were born remember
i was born here and i stay here
do not push me Ramn
if you stay i have to kill you
i told you to have the sun behind you
do not forget to count the steps
one step and he is afraid
two steps and he is uneasy
Three steps Ramn he is about to kill you
but i had a shave
Rezza
Rezza
Hey Chico you made it
a small credit goes to me as well
now you will feel this wall Chico
a big wall
do not try to climb it Chico
you will never succeed
Alright Mick
what is your decision
okay Mister Barrett i am selling
i appreciate it Mick
that is a splendid idea
Let's go have a drink and discuss the selling price
Barrett

Ramn
Ramn

what is the matter boy
Out of my way sheriff
i am not a boy

this madman is about to kill me
what is it that you want
i want to kill Barrett
Stop it Ramn i beg you
Why kill him
what has he done to you
he is a lousy murderer
he killed my father

i had nothing to do with it
it was Burt
Burt worked for you and you had him kill my father
Just like Steven
what do you know about Steven
Go ask Barrett
he knows everything
if you know something tell us Ramn
i am gonna arrest him
Get out of my way sheriff

Until somebody catches one

Hurry up and catch something
Maeda it is your f ault
Catch something

Even fish are drawn to the unselfish
and this is a big one

Somebody gave them to me
These are Kinsai Family only badges

Ultra cool
one a piece

about what
that will make you rest easy
Proof that the f amily's behind you
i do not know
where is your report Nijima
you should have some information now right
Just put it down in a report
no need to tell anyone else
Just write it down
you do not understand
you are not betraying him he is betraying you
what is it you are risking your life to protect
Think about it
Your gang right
Tell me i am wrong
Well your gang is on the brink
you get it
do not think about yourself
do not think about the others
Try to think about the whole
okay

Hurry up

Leader

it is called a Eurasian Kings Eye

Found one

Hey Nijima
Let's take a walk
where
Downstairs
Says to hit the Head of the Kinsai Family
not in so many words but
Nijima
you met the top man
the old rock digger
it is a direct order from him
Sorry
they had me investigate you and write a report
i never wrote a word about your contact with the Kinsai Family
but that old man seemed to know anyway
Up a creek without a paddle right
what are you gonna do
what to do
what should i do
Iwamatu
you should really think it through
and choose the path you think is right
you will go with my decision
yes
i am home
Noriko
what is wrong
Mitsuko's
Mitsuko's room
it is alright
there is nothing there
what do you want
it is your f ault
what
you are the cop that conned Iwamatu
no i
he was doing fine until you came along
Mr Nijima
you have to help Iwamatu
Iwamatu's finished
he is reached his limit
he never was cut out for this line of work
he is unreliable
and gutless
i will do anything for you
so please you have to help him
Iwamatu
huh
i will do it
uh
the Kinsai Family job
Wait
Just a minute
do not worry i will do it alone
no
that is no
it will be fine
it will go just the way you want
the way i want
what did i ever want
Hey Nijima
Wait up
Hey
Stop
you can not do it alone
we will do it together
do not worry
i will lure him out
i have a good idea
Try this one
this one works
These poor creatures are miserable
when living creatures die most decompose and become earth
but these guys here do not
a series of unfortunate circumstances prevented it
but see how beautiful they are now
they have discovered new life
i think that is just excellent
the real value is in things that have once ended
what value
no one knows that yet
but
this you must believe
Emptiness is not misery
it is the beginning of something new
this is an astronium from the Miocene period 50 million years ago
here
it is yours
i almost forgot
the head of the Kinsai Family is very much alive
yeah
the guy you hit was his double
a trap by Iwamatu
Iwamatu huh
Also i have something for you
it is for you
you alone
inside it says Iwamatu
Iwamatu
that is right
Iwamatu
Hit Iwamatu
okay
Fine
it is up to you
i will go get some food
okay
hello
this is Iwamatu
yes
that is fine
that is the plan
yes
i understand
who the hell are you
Hey you wait
it is nibbling
oh man it got away
i am just not cut out for fishing
can not even catch a boot
